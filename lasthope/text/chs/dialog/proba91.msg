### {100}{}{How's it going, pal?}
{100}{}{怎么样，朋友？}
### {101}{}{I never get tired of talking to you. Anything else?}
{101}{}{我总是不厌其烦地和你说话。还有别的吗？}
### {102}{}{Some geckos were running this way, seen any?}
{102}{}{有些壁虎朝这边跑，看到了吗？}
### {103}{}{Where did I put my book?}
{103}{}{我把书放在哪里了？}
### {104}{}{Nothing new 'round here. What about you?}
{104}{}{这里没有什么新鲜事。你呢？}
### {105}{}{Hello, stranger. New in town?}
{105}{}{你好，陌生人。城里新来的？}
### {106}{}{Yes I am. [Smile.] How do you do?}
{106}{}{是的。[微笑。]你好吗？}
### {107}{}{Maybe. What can you tell me about this place?}
{107}{}{大概关于这个地方你能告诉我什么？}
### {108}{}{No, lived here all my life. [Roll eyes.]}
{108}{}{不，我在这里住了一辈子。[翻白眼。]}
### {109}{}{[Shrugs.] Got my peace and quiet. Plenty of geckos around, so I can't complain. Trade is slow as ever, but I'm doing alright. Guess, we all do, kinda. It's a community thing. We don't have much, but we help each other. And that includes those nut-jobs guarding us, well, and Stockman's, I guess.}
{109}{}{得到了我的平静。周围有很多壁虎，所以我不能抱怨。交易一如既往地缓慢，但我做得很好。我猜，我们都有。这是一个社区的事情。我们没有多少，但我们互相帮助。这包括那些保护我们的疯子工作，我想还有斯托克曼的。}
### {110}{}{Anything going on around here?}
{110}{}{这附近有什么事吗？}
### {111}{}{What's with Stockman's?}
{111}{}{斯托克曼的怎么了？}
### {112}{}{What about those guards?}
{112}{}{那些警卫呢？}
### {113}{}{Any visitors lately?}
{113}{}{最近有访客吗？}
### {114}{}{Nothing really. There is a bulletin board if you need to know. [Gestures at it.] Well, may be out of date. Not much point in it these days. Hardly any visitors to read it. Still, I guess, there's Stockman's and Joe's garage but they don't run so well no more. Then there's Jack's drug store who sells medicine, Quincy's to buy weapons from, probably the last of use who manages to get steady supplies, God knows how, Anna's bar if you need a pick-me-up, and Doc Karl who keeps us all up and running. [Grins.] The rest of us are farmers, hunters and small time traders. We get by.}
{114}{}{没什么。如果你需要知道的话，这里有一个公告牌。[对着它做手势。]嗯，可能已经过时了。这几天没什么意义。几乎没有访客读过。不过，我想，那里有斯托克曼和乔的车库，但他们已经不怎么好用了。还有杰克的药店卖药，昆西的药店买武器，可能是最后一个能稳定供应的人，天知道怎么回事，如果你需要接我的话，还有安娜的酒吧，还有卡尔医生，他让我们都保持运转。我们其余的人都是农民、猎人和小商贩。我们过得去。}
### {115}{}{What's wrong with Stockman's?}
{115}{}{斯托克曼的怎么了？}
### {116}{}{And those guards you've mentioned?}
{116}{}{你提到的那些警卫呢？}
### {117}{}{Well, if there's a business in town it's theirs. They did a pretty penny once. Trading, guarding shipments, investments, anything around goods, cash and trade, really. But ever since the contract with Miners fell apart, and the caravans stopped coming, the town's been kinda isolated, and their business suffered the worst. Well, besides Joe's.}
{117}{}{如果城里有生意，那就是他们的。他们曾经赚了一大笔钱。贸易，保护货物，投资，任何与货物有关的东西，现金和贸易，真的。但自从与矿工队的合同破裂，大篷车也不再来了，这个小镇就有点孤立，他们的生意受到了最严重的影响。嗯，除了乔的。}
### {118}{}{Any laws in town?}
{118}{}{城里有法律吗？}
### {119}{}{Well, there are two groups, Derek's and the Bulls. Both run some sort of militia group. Arming themselves up and protecting the town against bandits, mutants and such. Well, they say they do, it's all a bit gung-ho. Still, you may call them the local law, but it all depends on who you're talking to. Matter of fact is, we have no sheriff, judge or jury. So if you break the law who knows what will happen. [Laughs.] May change one day, but we're in no rush.}
{119}{}{有两个小组，德里克和公牛。两人都经营着某种民兵组织。武装自己，保护城镇免受土匪、变种人等的袭击。嗯，他们说他们有，这一切都有点狂热。尽管如此，你可以称之为当地法律，但这完全取决于你在和谁说话。事实上，我们没有警长、法官或陪审团。所以，如果你违法了，谁知道会发生什么。也许有一天会改变，但我们并不着急。}
### {120}{}{What makes you doubt them?}
{120}{}{是什么让你怀疑他们？}
### {121}{}{To be honest, I doubt any bandits are bothering with this place. And I've never seen any mutants either. So what are they doing out there? Other than camping. [Laughs.] But to be fair, I never really paid any attention to them, they go about playing their military games, or whatever they do, it never bothered me much. I guess they keep the area safe, but as long as they don't scare away the geckos, I'm fine either way. I guess the worst would be if both groups would end up at each other's throat. That could get messy.}
{121}{}{老实说，我怀疑有土匪在这里捣乱。我也从来没有见过任何变种人。那么他们在外面干什么呢？除了露营。[笑]但公平地说，我从来没有真正关注过他们，他们到处玩军事游戏，或者不管他们做什么，这从来没有让我感到困扰。我想他们会保护这个地区的安全，但只要他们不吓跑壁虎，我不管怎样都很好。我想最糟糕的情况是，如果两组人最终都掐住了对方的喉咙。这可能会变得一团糟。}
### {122}{}{I see, thanks.}
{122}{}{我明白了，谢谢。}
### {123}{}{I haven't seen anyone coming this way, but I've heard of a suspicious bunch moving east. Seemed like the secretive type, didn't talk, didn't care showing their faces. They stayed for a bit, asked some questions, stocked up on supplies, then moved on east. From what I gathered they were after a place called Golden Valley. Apparently there's an old gold mine. Attracts all kinds of dubious characters. But I doubt there is anything left in that place, but old, abandoned mine shafts. It's always the same. We're a more quiet and peaceful community of farmers and hunters, well, for the most part...}
{123}{}{我没见过有人从这里来，但我听说有一群可疑的人向东移动。看起来像是神秘的类型，不说话，不在乎露面。他们停留了一段时间，问了一些问题，储备了物资，然后向东进发。据我所知，他们在寻找一个叫金谷的地方。显然有一个古老的金矿。吸引各种可疑人物。但我怀疑那个地方除了旧的、废弃的矿井外，还剩下什么。它总是一样的。我们是一个由农民和猎人组成的更安静、更和平的社区，嗯，在大多数情况下。。。}
### {124}{}{To the east you say. Hm, interesting. Anything else going on around here?}
{124}{}{你说往东走。嗯，很有趣。这里还有什么事吗？}
### {125}{}{Funny, never seen you before.}
{125}{}{真有趣，从没见过你。}
### {126}{}{Well, I've never seen you before either. So, what's up?}
{126}{}{我以前也从没见过你。那么，怎么了？}
### {127}{}{I prefer to keep to myself. Which reminds me. Bye.}
{127}{}{我更喜欢独处。这提醒了我，再见。}
### {128}{}{[Panic.] I knew I shouldn't have left the vault! Aaaarghh!}
{128}{}{我就知道我不应该离开金库！啊啊！}
### {129}{}{Perhaps I should get out more. Anything interesting?}
{129}{}{也许我应该多出去走走。有什么有趣的吗？}
### {130}{}{The usual, nothing changes much around here, [eyes you suspiciously], as you know.}
{130}{}{和往常一样，这里没有什么变化，[怀疑地看着你]，正如你所知。}
### {131}{}{Yeah, right. Seen anyone new lately?}
{131}{}{是的，对。最近有新朋友吗？}
### {132}{}{Well, then. Don't let me disturb you... standing here. Bye.}
{132}{}{那好吧。别让我打扰你。。。站在这里。再见}
### {133}{}{Besides you?}
{133}{}{除了你？}
### {134}{}{...}
{134}{}{...}
### {135}{}{That's right.}
{135}{}{没错。}
### {136}{}{Seen anyone coming into town lately?}
{136}{}{最近有人进城吗？}
### {137}{}{What's the deal with Stockman's?}
{137}{}{斯托克曼的是怎么回事？}
### {138}{}{Tell me about the local law.}
{138}{}{告诉我当地的法律。}
### {139}{}{Tell me about this place again.}
{139}{}{再跟我说说这个地方。}
### {140}{}{Nothing. Bye.}
{140}{}{没有什么再见}
### {141}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{141}{}{让我再问你一件事。}
### {142}{}{You have failed to use your steal skill.}
{142}{}{你没有使用你的偷技。}
### {143}{}{[Chance: }
{143}{}{[机会：}
### {144}{}{[Intelligence required: }
{144}{}{[所需情报：}
### {145}{}{The town of Golden Valley has been added to your map.}
{145}{}{金谷镇已添加到您的地图中。}
