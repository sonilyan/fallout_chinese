### {223}{}{Oh, I'm sorry... I can cure you. But the drugs are too expensive. We will spend on your treatment }
{223}{}{哦，对不起...我可以治好你。但是这些药太贵了。我们会花在你的治疗上}
### {224}{}{ caps. What can you offer for compensation?}
{224}{}{瓶盖。你能提供什么补偿？}
### {225}{}{bottlecaps. Exactly as much as you need.}
{225}{}{装瓶。你需要多少就多少。}

{231}{}{医生，我累了。我想戒除毒瘾！}
### {1231}{}{Doctor, I'm tired. I want to get rid of this addiction!}
{1231}{}{医生，我累了。我想戒除毒瘾！}
### {232}{}{My heart shrinks when I see your torment. If you really WANT to stop, then I will do my besta to help you.}
{232}{}{看到你的折磨，我的心都缩了。如果你真的想停下来，那么我会尽我所能帮助你。}
### {233}{}{Yes! What is needed for this?}
{233}{}{对这需要什么？}
### {234}{}{Rehabilitation is an expensive and lengthy process. I'm afraid the clinic won't be able to fully cover these costs yet.}
{234}{}{康复是一个昂贵而漫长的过程。恐怕诊所还不能完全支付这些费用。}
### {235}{}{Your clinic is just a way of removing the bottlecaps. I'm leaving here!}
{235}{}{你的诊所只是去除瓶颈的一种方法。我要离开这里！}
### {236}{}{I don't have anything. I'm going to ask good people.}
{236}{}{我什么都没有。我要问好人。}
### {237}{}{I understand. I'll pay }
{237}{}{我理解。我会付钱的}
### {238}{}{ caps. Is that enough?}
{238}{}{瓶盖。够了吗？}
### {239}{}{Hmm. It's not much, but there's nothing you can do - after all, you need to be saved.}
{239}{}{嗯，不多，但你也无能为力――毕竟，你需要被拯救。}
### {240}{}{Before we start, I need to leave. I'll be back a little later.}
{240}{}{在我们开始之前，我需要离开。我稍后会回来。}
### {241}{}{Here are the bottlecaps. When do we start?}
{241}{}{这是水瓶。我们什么时候开始？}
### {242}{}{The sooner the better. First you should take a bath...}
{242}{}{越快越好。首先你应该洗个澡...}
### {243}{}{A whole bath? Wow!}
{243}{}{洗个完整的澡？哇！}
### {244}{}{The ability "Rehabilitation" was obtained.}
{244}{}{获得了“康复”能力。}
### {245}{}{After a week of treatment and training, you got rid of your addiction and got stronger for a possible relapse.}
{245}{}{经过一周的治疗和训练，你摆脱了毒瘾，变得更强壮，以应对可能的复发。}

### {250}{}{Did you talk about pre-war medicine and some experiments?}
{250}{}{你谈过战前的医学和一些实验吗？}
### {251}{}{Oh, yeah. We have vaccinations against various diseases, a pre-war system for health promotion and Vault-Tec equipment for special training in bomb Vaults. But none of us seriously conducted these experiments.}
{251}{}{哦，是的。我们有针对各种疾病的疫苗接种，战前的健康促进系统，以及用于炸弹库特殊训练的Vault Tec设备。但我们都没有认真地进行这些实验。}
### {252}{}{Sounds promising.}
{252}{}{听起来很有希望。}
### {253}{}{The problem is also high costs. Such procedures are not essential and take a lot of resources and time. Therefore, the clinic cannot provide such a service at its own expense.}
{253}{}{问题还在于高昂的成本。这样的程序并不重要，需要大量的资源和时间。因此，诊所不能自费提供此类服务。}
### {254}{}{How much does it cost?}
{254}{}{它要多少钱？}
### {255}{}{Hmm. Let me count it... It will cost in }
{255}{}{嗯，让我数一下……会花掉的}

### {258}{}{I'm taking the bait, Doc. Here is the payment for the service.}
{258}{}{我上当了，医生。这是服务费。}
### {259}{}{Very good. To begin with, we will conduct a survey...}

{260}{}{嘿，它很痒，医生！}

### {263}{}{Can I take that wellness course again?}
{263}{}{我可以再参加一次健康课程吗？}
### {264}{}{It's possible. But the effect will no longer be so noticeable. This time you will have to spend more time and effort to achieve the same results.}
{264}{}{这是可能的。但这种影响将不再那么明显。这一次你将不得不花费更多的时间和精力来获得同样的结果。}
### {265}{}{How much does it cost?}
{265}{}{它要多少钱？}
### {266}{}{}
{266}{}{error : string is empty}
### {267}{}{ bottlecaps and will take two weeks of time.}
{267}{}{装瓶，需要两周时间。}

### {300}{}{I need to talk to you about my friend Carlos.}
{300}{}{我需要和你谈谈我的朋友卡洛斯。}
### {301}{}{Of course. What happened to him?}
{301}{}{当然他怎么了？}
### {302}{}{He is interestaed in old technologies. Do you have a vacancy for him?}
{302}{}{他对旧技术感兴趣。你有他的空缺吗？}
### {303}{}{An intriguing suggestaion. But where is he?}
{303}{}{一个有趣的暗示。但他在哪里？}
### {304}{}{He is currently staying in Two-Sun and is waiting for your answer.}
{304}{}{他目前住在Two Sun，正在等待您的答复。}
### {305}{}{What a surprise. So he is... tinker?}
{305}{}{真是个惊喜。所以他是…锡匠？}
### {306}{}{No, no, he's from my village. The tinkerers accepted Carlos, appreciating his talents.}
{306}{}{不，不，他来自我的村庄。锡匠们接受了卡洛斯，欣赏他的才华。}
### {307}{}{However, I am not sure that it is worth discussing with anyone. Sorry to bother you.}
{307}{}{然而，我不确定这是否值得与任何人讨论。很抱歉打扰你。}
### {308}{}{Oh, curious. I'm relying on your reputation. If you believe in the cleanliness of his thoughts, then that's enough for me. Tell him that we are ready to welcome your friend with all the hospitality.}
{308}{}{哦，很奇怪。我相信你的名声。如果你相信他的思想是干净的，那么这对我来说就足够了。告诉他，我们准备热情欢迎你的朋友。}
### {309}{}{Thank you!}
{309}{}{非常感谢。}
### {310}{}{Oh, curious. But at the same time, it is very doubtful. I'm afraid we can't take risks with untestaed assistants right now.}
{310}{}{哦，很奇怪。但与此同时，这是非常令人怀疑的。恐怕我们现在不能和无人值守的助理一起冒险。}
### {311}{}{I understand. It's a pity my reputation doesn't convince you.}
{311}{}{我理解。很遗憾，我的名声不能使你信服。}

#A questa to clean up plantations
### {320}{}{I know about the infection that turns peasants into monsters.}
{320}{}{我知道把农民变成怪物的传染病。}
### {321}{}{So you know...}
{321}{}{所以你知道...}
### {322}{}{No need to roll your eyes and make these heavy sighs. It's your fault, isn't it?}
{322}{}{没有必要翻白眼，发出沉重的叹息。这是你的错，不是吗？}
### {323}{}{Yes, it's our mistake. And it's getting harder to hide it. But I ask for your understanding - you can't create panic. It's already difficult for us to manage with so many worries in the city.}
{323}{}{是的，这是我们的错误。隐藏起来越来越难了。但我请求你的理解――你不能制造恐慌。城市里有这么多忧虑，我们已经很难应付了。}
### {324}{}{Why don't you declare quarantine?}
{324}{}{你为什么不宣布隔离？}
### {325}{}{This is unthinkable! People should keep an eye on the plantations so that they do not disappear into the sands. And if the population escapes from the city altogether, looters will come here and spread the infection even further.}
{325}{}{这简直不可思议！人们应该留意种植园，以免它们消失在沙子里。如果人口完全逃离城市，抢劫者就会来到这里，并进一步传播感染。}
### {326}{}{Really?}
{326}{}{真正地}
### {327}{}{In addition, the risk of a widespread epidemic is still extremely small. All the victims were infected only because they were close to the laboratory where the leak occurred. Although insects are beginning to spread it further and further.}
{327}{}{此外，大范围流行的风险仍然非常小。所有受害者之所以被感染，只是因为他们离发生泄漏的实验室很近。尽管昆虫开始把它传播得越来越远。}
### {328}{}{Is it true?}
{328}{}{这是真的吗？}
### {329}{}{Something is hard to believe.}
{329}{}{有些事情令人难以置信。}
### {330}{}{In any case, there is no point in panicking. We almost know how to solve the problem. There are only a few unknowns missing from this equation.}
{330}{}{无论如何，恐慌是没有意义的。我们几乎知道如何解决这个问题。这个方程式只缺少几个未知数。}
### {331}{}{Hmm. I don't know if I believe you.}
{331}{}{嗯，我不知道我是否相信你。}
### {332}{}{How did you even let this happen?}
{332}{}{你是怎么让这种事发生的？}
### {333}{}{We tried to solve the food problem by creating the most resilient and fruitful fauna. Infection is a side effect of experiments on plants and insects, which was difficult to foresee.}
{333}{}{我们试图通过创造最具弹性和最富有成效的动物群来解决粮食问题。感染是植物和昆虫实验的副作用，这是很难预见的。}
### {334}{}{Hmm. I don't know if I believe you.}
{334}{}{嗯，我不知道我是否相信你。}
### {335}{}{Are you going to correct your mistake?}
{335}{}{你打算改正你的错误吗？}
### {336}{}{Of course. We spend all our free time calculating and experimenting. But so far we are missing some data.}
{336}{}{当然我们把所有的空闲时间都花在计算和实验上。但到目前为止，我们还缺少一些数据。}
### {337}{}{I hope you will sort out this problem. Otherwise it will be bad for everyone.}
{337}{}{我希望你能解决这个问题。否则对每个人都不好。}
### {338}{}{Wait. You're not going to create a panic, are you? Now we need help, not new problems. Moreover, we will pay generously for the service.}
{338}{}{等待你不会制造恐慌的，是吗？现在我们需要帮助，而不是新问题。此外，我们将为这项服务慷慨解囊。}
### {339}{}{And what do you want from me?}
{339}{}{你想从我这里得到什么？}
### {340}{}{Is there anything I can help you with?}
{340}{}{有什么我能帮你的吗？}
### {341}{}{We need help now more than ever. Moreover, we will pay generously for the service.}
{341}{}{我们现在比以往任何时候都更需要帮助。此外，我们将为这项服务慷慨解囊。}
### {342}{}{What can I do for you?}
{342}{}{我能为你做什么？}
### {343}{}{Our laboratory outside the city has become a hotbed of infection. There is also all the laboratory documentation that we did not have time to take out before quarantine. And some chemical reagents needed for experiments.}
{343}{}{我们在城外的实验室成了感染的温床。还有我们在隔离前没有时间拿出的所有实验室文件。以及一些实验所需的化学试剂。}
### {344}{}{Are you suggestaing I go there?}
{344}{}{你是在建议我去那里吗？}
### {345}{}{Now the laboratory is closed under quarantine, and residents are forbidden to even approach there. God knows what this place has turned into now, but it is overgrown with vegetation. There are a lot of insects there and perhaps some infected are still alive.}
{345}{}{现在，实验室被隔离关闭，居民甚至被禁止接近那里。天知道这个地方现在变成了什么样子，但它长满了植被。那里有很多昆虫，也许有些受感染的昆虫还活着。}
### {346}{}{But then I risk getting infected, don't I?}
{346}{}{但我有被感染的风险，不是吗？}
### {347}{}{Yes. And this is the main problem. We'll give you an antidote for insect bites. But against spores in the air, you will have to look for a gas mask. We offered the tinsmiths to make gas masks, but apparently they have higher priority orders.}
{347}{}{对这是主要问题。我们会给你一种昆虫叮咬的解药。但是面对空气中的孢子，你必须找一个防毒面具。我们提供给锡匠制造防毒面具，但显然他们有更高的优先级订单。}
### {348}{}{Okay. I will help you.}
{348}{}{可以我会帮你的。}
### {349}{}{Thank you. When you're ready, come to me. I'll take you to the lab so that the resta of the residents won't notice you.}
{349}{}{非常感谢。当你准备好了，来找我。我会带你去实验室，这样居民餐厅就不会注意到你。}
### {350}{}{See you later.}
{350}{}{回头见。}
### {351}{}{You are as crazy a scientist as those who created a nuclear bomb before the War. I refuse to cooperate with you.}
{351}{}{你和战前制造核弹的科学家一样疯狂。我拒绝与你合作。}
### {352}{}{I understand. You don't trust us and you don't want to take any chances. But now it does not matter who is to blame for what happened, it is more important to solve the problem. Think about what a heroic service you will render to the city. You will be remembered for generations. If you change your mind, come back.}
{352}{}{我理解。你不信任我们，也不想冒险。但现在谁应该为所发生的事情负责并不重要，更重要的是解决问题。想想你将为这座城市做出多么英勇的贡献。你们将被世世代代铭记。如果你改变主意，就回来吧。}
### {353}{}{Bye.}
{353}{}{再见}
### {354}{}{I can't figure out how to use this poison properly.}
{354}{}{我不知道如何正确使用这种毒药。}
### {355}{}{Go to the plantation and spray it somewhere in the most densely overgrown place.}
{355}{}{去种植园，把它喷到杂草最茂密的地方。}
### {356}{}{Okay.}
{356}{}{可以}
### {357}{}{Well, that's another thing.}
{357}{}{好吧，那是另一回事。}

### {360}{}{I'll help you. It's time to end this infection!}
{360}{}{我会帮你的。是时候结束这种感染了！}
### {361}{}{I'm glad to hear that. Maybe we won't be able to do anything without you.}
{361}{}{听到这个我很高兴。也许没有你我们什么都做不了。}
### {362}{}{I'm ready to go.}
{362}{}{我准备好了。}
### {1362}{}{I'm ready to go.}
{1362}{}{我准备好了。}
### {363}{}{Wait. I need to grab a couple more things. I'll be back soon.}
{363}{}{等待我需要多拿几件东西。我很快就会回来。}
### {364}{}{Your task is to find laboratory documents and components to create an insecticide that they tried to develop there. The faster you do it, the less harm your body will get. Here, take the antidote and the stimpack. Good luck.}
{364}{}{你的任务是找到实验室文件和成分，以制造他们试图在那里开发的杀虫剂。你做得越快，对身体的伤害就越小。给，拿着解药和兴奋剂。祝你好运}
### {365}{}{[Go to the lab]}
{365}{}{[去实验室]}
### {366}{}{Here are the laboratory data and reagents.}
{366}{}{这是实验室数据和试剂。}
### {367}{}{Finally! Now we are one step away from victory. I need time to study and check the materials...}
{367}{}{最后现在我们离胜利只有一步之遥。我需要时间学习和检查材料...}
### {368}{}{Please.}
{368}{}{请}
### {369}{}{...So that's what our colleague suggestaed? How could I not have guessed right away! Yes, different specialization affects. I am not strong in insects, so I could not take into account such a symbiosis with fungal spores... Oh, Wang Chong, how his boring maxims are missing now.}
{369}{}{…所以这就是我们同事的建议？我怎么能不马上猜到呢！是的，不同的专业化影响。我不擅长昆虫，所以我无法考虑与真菌孢子的共生关系...哦，王冲，他那无聊的格言现在怎么不见了。}
### {370}{}{What are you going to do?}
{370}{}{你打算怎么办？}
### {371}{}{First of all, I will make an insecticide to stop the spread of the infection. I think it won't take much time, because the reagents from the laboratory are well preserved. Please wait in the corridor for a couple of hours.}
{371}{}{首先，我会制作一种杀虫剂来阻止感染的传播。我认为这不会花太多时间，因为实验室的试剂保存得很好。请在走廊里等上几个小时。}
### {372}{}{Okay...}
{372}{}{可以}
### {373}{}{Ready! It is a mixture of a fungicide against fungal spores and an insecticide against parasite carriers. It must be sprayed on plantations. Do it while we do the resta of the work.}
{373}{}{准备好的它是一种对抗真菌孢子的杀菌剂和对抗寄生虫携带者的杀虫剂的混合物。它必须喷洒在种植园里。在我们做其余工作的时候做。}
### {374}{}{Okay.}
{374}{}{可以}
### {375}{}{I sprayed poisons on the plantation. The effect did not take long to wait.}
{375}{}{我在种植园里喷洒毒药。效果没等多久。}
### {1375}{}{I sprayed poisons on the plantation. The effect did not take long to wait.}
{1375}{}{我在种植园里喷洒毒药。效果没等多久。}
### {376}{}{It's probably in your genes to be diligent. All this pest control work is a model for the rest of the Followers. Someday we will send a report describing this story to the Burial Ground.}
{376}{}{勤奋可能是你的基因使然。所有这些害虫防治工作都是追随者们的榜样。总有一天，我们会向墓地发送一份描述这个故事的报告。}
### {377}{}{I'm sorry, bespectacled. But I risked for the promised caps, not for the sake of science.}
{377}{}{对不起，戴眼镜的。但我冒着风险是为了承诺的上限，而不是为了科学。}
### {1377}{}{I'm sorry, bespectacled. But I risked for the promised caps, not for the sake of science.}
{1377}{}{对不起，戴眼镜的。但我冒着风险是为了承诺的上限，而不是为了科学。}
### {378}{}{All work must be paid. I asked the mayor for a bonus - 350 caps are due to you. Spend them wisely. And thanks again.}
{378}{}{所有工作都必须有报酬。我向市长要了一笔奖金――你要350个瓶盖。明智地使用它们。再次感谢。}

### {381}{}{We saw smoke from the fire. This is your doing, isn't it? (sigh) What a fool you are...}
{381}{}{我们看到了火冒出的烟。这是你干的，不是吗？（叹气）你真傻...}
### {1381}{}{We saw smoke from the fire. This is your doing, isn't it? (sigh) What a stupid thing to do...}
{1381}{}{我们看到了火冒出的烟。这是你干的，不是吗？（叹气）做一件多么愚蠢的事...}
### {382}{}{Is something wrong? Isn't the breeding ground of infection destroyed?}
{382}{}{有什么不对劲吗？感染的滋生地难道没有被摧毁吗？}
### {383}{}{There were other ways to destroy the nursery! But along with the laboratory, all scientific works that could help people in the future were destroyed!}

### {387}{}{?}
{387}{}{？}
### {388}{}{I'm sorry, of course, what you did was right. Safety comes first. But what if the infection grows again in another place? Without scientific data from the laboratory, it will be much more difficult to cope with it. On the other hand, we now have a lot of time to prepare. So in any case, thank you.}
{388}{}{当然，我很抱歉，你做的是对的。安全第一。但是，如果感染在另一个地方再次增长呢？如果没有来自实验室的科学数据，应对它将更加困难。另一方面，我们现在有很多时间准备。不管怎样，谢谢你。}
### {389}{}{The main thing is that the problem has been solved. Good luck with your research, Nestor.}
{389}{}{最重要的是问题已经解决了。祝你的研究好运，内斯特。}
### {390}{}{Hey, hey! Will I get paid? It wasn't that easy.}
{390}{}{嘿，嘿！我会得到报酬吗？事情没那么容易。}

### {395}{}{In the laboratory, I came across these chemicals.}
{395}{}{在实验室里，我发现了这些化学物质。}
### {396}{}{Perhaps these chemicals will be useful in the manufacture of poison. Look more carefully in the laboratory, there should be detailed documentation and the necessary equipment.}
{396}{}{也许这些化学物质对制造毒药有用。在实验室里仔细观察，应该有详细的文件和必要的设备。}
### {397}{}{Okay, I'm going to look further.}
{397}{}{好吧，我再往下看。}
### {398}{}{Well, it already seemed to me that the job was done ...}

### {407}{}{Every employee is valuable to us, especially with such a wealth of experience and motivation. And the data she gathered on the way here is simply priceless. I am sure it will bring a lot of benefits here.}
{407}{}{每一位员工对我们来说都是有价值的，尤其是拥有如此丰富的经验和动力的员工。她在来这里的路上收集到的数据简直是无价之宝。我相信这会给这里带来很多好处。}
### {408}{}{That's good.}
{408}{}{这很好。}
### {409}{}{Unfortunately, she still does not understand that in Casa Nueva it is important to follow the rules and not go against the authorities. And yes, I know that Diana survived because of you. Thank you.}
{409}{}{不幸的是，她仍然不明白，在努瓦之家，遵守规则而不是违反当局是很重要的。是的，我知道戴安娜是因为你才活下来的。非常感谢。}
### {410}{}{I see. Remind me who's who here?}
{410}{}{我明白了。提醒我谁在这里？}
### {411}{}{Why is Theresa so obstinate?}
{411}{}{特蕾莎为什么这么固执？}
### {412}{}{Excuse her. After all, working with children is a difficult matter, and almost no one has such experience nowadays. All she can do is read old books on child psychology and figure it out on the go. And this despite the fact that she still has to do science.}
{412}{}{对不起。毕竟，和孩子一起工作是一件困难的事情，现在几乎没有人有这样的经历。她所能做的就是阅读关于儿童心理学的旧书，并在旅途中找到答案。尽管事实上她仍然要做科学。}
### {413}{}{Why do you need an assistant?}
{413}{}{你为什么需要助理？}
### {414}{}{I'm not coping. I got a clinic and a chemical laboratory, although I am not a specialist in chemistry. Alexandra relieves me of this burden.}
{414}{}{我无法应付。我有一个诊所和一个化学实验室，虽然我不是化学专家。亚历山德拉减轻了我的负担。}
### {415}{}{But which of you was engaged in plantations?}
{415}{}{但你们中的哪一个从事种植园？}
### {416}{}{This person is not with us. He sacrificed himself to science. Please don't ask about him, so as not to hurt someone's feelings.}
{416}{}{这个人不在我们身边。他为科学牺牲了自己。请不要问他，以免伤害别人的感情。}
### {417}{}{But there was another Follower, right?}
{417}{}{但还有另一个追随者，对吧？}
### {418}{}{Wang Chun... He was unlucky. He spent most of his time in greenhouses. He didn't like communicating with people, but he loved plants and science. That's what killed him when mutagenic spores took over his body. You know, it's better if you don't ask about him, so as not to hurt someone's feelings.}
{418}{}{王春...他运气不好。他大部分时间都在温室里度过。他不喜欢与人交流，但他喜欢植物和科学。当诱变孢子占据他的身体时，这就是杀死他的原因。你知道，最好不要问他，以免伤害别人的感情。}
### {419}{}{Plantations are also your business?}
{419}{}{种植园也是你的事吗？}
### {420}{}{That's right.}
{420}{}{没错。}
### {421}{}{Isn't it strange to grow plants in the middle of the desert?}
{421}{}{在沙漠中央种植植物不是很奇怪吗？}
### {422}{}{Believe me, we had a reason to be here. This decision is the result of extensive scientific research.}
{422}{}{相信我，我们来这里是有原因的。这一决定是广泛科学研究的结果。}

### {430}{}{Tell me about the clinic.}
{430}{}{告诉我诊所的情况。}
### {431}{}{I don't even know what to say. We opened it mainly to serve soldiers from Puerto. It was part of the general agreement with the military, otherwise we would not have been allowed here. And then local workers began to come asking for help.}
{431}{}{我甚至不知道该说什么。我们开放它主要是为来自波多黎各的士兵服务。这是与军方达成的总协议的一部分，否则我们就不会被允许来这里。然后，当地工人开始前来寻求帮助。}
### {432}{}{Okay. Let's change the subject.}
{432}{}{可以让我们换个话题。}
### {433}{}{Where did all this equipment come from?}
{433}{}{这些设备是从哪里来的？}
### {434}{}{Some things were made by tinsmiths to order. Some things were brought with caravans from different places.}
{434}{}{有些东西是锡匠按订单做的。有些东西是用大篷车从不同的地方带来的。}
### {435}{}{I see.}
{435}{}{我明白了。}
### {436}{}{I'm interested in your methods. In our Villa, apart from herbs and mushrooms, it is difficult to find anything.}
{436}{}{我对你的方法感兴趣。在我们的别墅里，除了草药和蘑菇，什么都很难找到。}
### {437}{}{I don't have any special prejudices about folk medicine. She was useful for her time. But gradually the pre-war methods are returning. We have finally launched a vaccination system against the wasteland disease. Isn't this a miracle?}
{437}{}{我对民间医学没有什么特别的偏见。她对自己的时代很有用。但战前的方法正在逐渐回归。我们终于启动了针对荒地疾病的疫苗接种系统。这不是一个奇迹吗？}
### {438}{}{And where do you get medicines?}
{438}{}{你在哪里买药？}
### {439}{}{We produce it ourselves, of course. For example, ethanol is easily produced from fire agave. And the resulting drugs are sold or exchanged for chemical raw materials.}
{439}{}{当然，我们自己生产。例如，火龙舌兰很容易生产乙醇。由此产生的药物被出售或交换为化学原料。}

### {440}{}{How do you live here?}
{440}{}{你在这里住得怎么样？}
### {441}{}{Just fine. It's hard to find a better city right now.}
{441}{}{很好。现在很难找到更好的城市。}
### {442}{}{It's good that you feel good.}
{442}{}{你感觉良好是件好事。}
### {443}{}{With such prohibitions?}
{443}{}{有这样的禁令？}
### {444}{}{What confuses you about the prohibitions? They were before the War. The authorities also have reasons to restrict ordinary residents. And they have to be reckoned with.}
{444}{}{是什么让你对禁令感到困惑？他们在战前。当局也有理由限制普通居民。他们必须得到重视。}
### {445}{}{Has lack of will and totalitarianism ever made people happy?}
{445}{}{缺乏意志和极权主义曾经让人们快乐过吗？}
### {446}{}{And have ordinary people ever been completely free? Such a story is possible only in a cave, in isolation from the rest of the world. And most likely, all alone. So, the conclusion is simple - to appreciate what we have.}
{446}{}{普通人曾经完全自由过吗？这样的故事只有在洞穴里才能发生，与世界其他地方隔绝。而且很可能是独自一人。因此，结论很简单――欣赏我们所拥有的。}
### {447}{}{Hmm. It's worth thinking about.}
{447}{}{嗯，这值得一想。}
### {448}{}{What can you tell us about your mayor?}
{448}{}{关于市长，你能告诉我们些什么？}
### {449}{}{Alvaro has a heavy load on his shoulders. He has to be responsible for the city only because there is no one else to do it. Don't give him any trouble.}
{449}{}{阿尔瓦罗肩上背负着沉重的负担。他必须对这个城市负责，因为没有其他人来做。不要给他任何麻烦。}
### {450}{}{Not even in my thoughts.}
{450}{}{甚至在我的脑海里都没有。}

### {451}{}{Do you know anything about Vault 24? }
{451}{}{你知道Vault 24吗？}
### {452}{}{This Vault is located on the ruins of San Diego. The founders of our mission came out of it. But I've never been there myself, because this place is cursed with radiation for many generations to come.}
{452}{}{这个避难所位于圣地亚哥的废墟上。我们使命的创始人就是从这里走出来的。但我自己从来没有去过那里，因为这个地方在未来的几代人中都受到辐射的诅咒。}
### {453}{}{How did the founders live there then?}
{453}{}{创始人当时是怎么住在那里的？}
### {454}{}{Vaults were built just in order to survive hard times in them after a nuclear attack. According to legend, the founders left the Vault in order to help the world reborn. This sacrifice of theirs is appreciated by all Followers.}
{454}{}{建造避难所只是为了在核袭击后度过艰难时期。根据传说，创始人离开避难所是为了帮助世界重生。他们的这种牺牲受到了所有追随者的赞赏。}
### {455}{}{I was there. The place is really cursed. And they also stole everything useful that was only there.}
{455}{}{我当时在场。这个地方真的被诅咒了。他们还偷走了所有有用的东西。}
### {456}{}{Not surprising. I heard about the Great Exodus of ghouls to the south, to the Glow. It looks like they found a suitable place for themselves. Well, let this radioactive earth be lenient with them.}
{456}{}{这并不奇怪。我听说了食尸鬼到南方的大出埃及记。看起来他们找到了一个适合自己的地方。好吧，让这个有放射性的地球对他们宽容一点。}
### {457}{}{Yes, something like that. Can we talk about something else?}
{457}{}{是的，差不多吧。我们能谈谈别的吗？}
### {458}{}{I have a piece of this Vault. Look, this is a copy of the diaries of the local caretaker.}
{458}{}{我有一块保险库。看，这是当地看护人的日记。}
### {459}{}{Really? Let me see... It turns out that the founders were forced by the situation? How corny. The legend sounded more beautiful, but... But now I see that they were just as simple people as everyone else. Thank you for this text. I'll save it for our history.}
{459}{}{真正地让我看看...事实证明，创始人是迫于形势吗？真老套。这个传说听起来更美丽，但是...但现在我发现他们和其他人一样简单。谢谢你的短信。我会把它留给我们的历史。}
### {460}{}{You are welcome. Can we talk about something else?}
{460}{}{不客气。我们能谈谈别的吗？}
### {461}{}{Can we talk about something else?}
{461}{}{我们能谈谈别的吗？}
