#{100}{}{Ogima the Black Cloud, the chief of the tribe.}
{100}{}{乌云奥吉玛，部落首领。}
#{101}{}{You see an old Cheyenne tribal chief.}
{101}{}{你看到一个夏延部落的老首领。}
#{102}{}{You should not have done it, outsider.}
{102}{}{你不该这么做，局外人。}
#{103}{}{You betrayed our trust, and for what? I have nothing you'd want anyway.}
{103}{}{你背叛了我们的信任，为什么？我没有你想要的东西。}
#{110}{}{We're a peaceful tribe, outsider. We will not talk with weapons in hand.}
{110}{}{我们是一个和平的部落，局外人。我们不会拿着武器说话。}
#{111}{}{Your tent, your rules. [put your weapon away]}
{111}{}{你的帐篷，你的规矩。[放下武器]}
#{112}{}{Then we will not talk.}
{112}{}{那我们就不谈了。}
#{113}{}{Outsider will put his weapon away if he wants to speak.}
{113}{}{如果外人想说话，他会把武器收起来的。}
#{115}{}{And so appears the man whose greed is more important than the peace of our dead...}
{115}{}{所以这个人的贪婪比我们死者的安宁更重要。。。}
#{116}{}{What are you talking about?}
{116}{}{你在说什么？}
#{117}{}{Someone disturbed our graves. It wasn't animals and it wasn't raiders. It's obvious to us both, but let our opinions stay with us. It can't be undone now, can it?}
{117}{}{有人扰乱了我们的坟墓。不是动物也不是袭击者。这对我们双方来说都很明显，但还是让我们的意见留在我们身边吧。现在不能撤消了，是吗？}
#{118}{}{Er... Okay, I guess. But I wanted to talk to you.}
{118}{}{呃。。。好吧，我想。但我想和你谈谈。}
#{119}{}{Oh... Uh, I'll go fill in the graves, then.}
{119}{}{哦。。。呃，那我就去扫墓。}
#{120}{}{Greetings, outsider. What guided your path to our village?}
{120}{}{你好，局外人。是什么指引你去我们村的？}
#{121}{}{Can I ask you about this area?}
{121}{}{我能问一下这个地区吗？}
#{122}{}{I want to talk about that sick boy, at the healer.}
{122}{}{我想谈谈那个生病的男孩，在疗养院。}
#{123}{}{Why is Makozid following me?}
{123}{}{为什么Makozid跟着我？}
#{124}{}{Your tribe doesn't have much interest in civilization, does it?}
{124}{}{你的部落对文明不感兴趣，是吗？}
#{125}{}{I'm looking for a radio station around here. Do you know where it is?}
{125}{}{我在这附近找广播电台。你知道它在哪里吗？}
#{126}{}{Let's talk about the raiders.}
{126}{}{我们来谈谈袭击者。}
#{127}{}{Nothing. I'm leaving.}
{127}{}{没有什么。我要走了。}
#{128}{}{The raiders are gone. What will happen to your tribe now?}
{128}{}{袭击者不见了。你的部落现在会怎么样？}
#{130}{}{The gods rarely touch these lands with their sights. There is nothing special here. When the wasteland devours our valley, this will go, too.}
{130}{}{众神很少用他们的目光去触摸这些土地。这里没有什么特别的。当荒地吞噬了我们的山谷，这也会消失。}
#{131}{}{Tell me more about your tribe.}
{131}{}{告诉我更多关于你的部落。}
#{132}{}{Tell me more about this settlement.}
{132}{}{告诉我更多关于这个定居点的事。}
#{133}{}{Tell me more about the raiders.}
{133}{}{告诉我更多关于袭击者的事。}
#{134}{}{What's around the camp?}
{134}{}{营地周围有什么？}
#{135}{}{Does anyone else live around here?}
{135}{}{这附近还有人住吗？}
#{136}{}{That's all.}
{136}{}{这就是全部。}
#{140}{}{Our tribe is growing crops and herding brahmin. It's the only things that the Heavenly Mother left to us. But even the last of what we have are now being taken from us by the parasites - those you'd call "raiders". Sometimes I wonder if we have angered the Ruler of Life, to bring such dark times to our people...}
{140}{}{我们部落种植庄稼，放牧婆罗门。这是天母留给我们的唯一东西。但是，即使是我们现在所拥有的最后一部分，也被寄生虫夺走了――你称之为“掠夺者”。有时我想知道我们是否激怒了生活的统治者，给我们的人民带来了如此黑暗的时代。。。}
#{141}{}{Our village is unwelcoming, but wanderers may always find food and rest here... For payment, of course. Also, the healer Niskigvan, with the help of Heavenly Mother, can heal wounds and pull poison from your body.}
{141}{}{我们的村庄不受欢迎，但流浪者可能总能在这里找到食物和休息。。。当然是为了付款。同时，治疗者尼斯基文，在天母的帮助下，可以治愈你的伤口，并从你身上拔出毒药。}
#{142}{}{Children of the World Devourer. Their dark lair lays to the north. Don't go there unless you have a reason to, for not all who go there return.}
{142}{}{世界之子吞噬者。他们黑暗的巢穴位于北方。除非你有理由，否则不要去那里，因为不是所有去那里的人都会回来。}
#{143}{}{The valley, the mountains, and our tribe - that is what wanderers will find here. But do not approach the World Devourer's children in their nest to the north.}
{143}{}{山谷，山脉，还有我们的部落――这就是流浪者在这里会发现的。但不要接近世界吞食者的孩子们在他们的巢北。}
#{144}{}{Few choose to live close to the Devourer's children. The brave ones had left this place many moons ago, now it is many days long to go to the nearest camp. Reno, Gerlach, and Poseidon Oil are all that eye of Cheyenne saw... Well, besides the legends.}
{144}{}{很少有人选择住在吞食者的孩子附近。勇敢的人已经离开这个地方很多个月了，现在要去最近的营地需要很多天。雷诺，杰拉克，波塞冬石油都是夏延人的眼睛看到的。。。嗯，除了传说。}
#{145}{}{I have another question.}
{145}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{146}{}{That's enough.}
{146}{}{够了。}
#{150}{}{Where is Reno?}
{150}{}{雷诺在哪？}
#{151}{}{What's Gerlach?}
{151}{}{杰拉克是什么？}
#{152}{}{Poseidon Oil? What is that?}
{152}{}{海神油？那是什么？}
#{153}{}{Legends?}
{153}{}{传说？}
#{154}{}{I already know of those. Let's talk about something else.}
{154}{}{我已经知道了。我们再谈点别的吧。}
#{155}{}{Reno, a city cursed by the gods. Evil spirits in the forms of men wander in those canyons of metal, glass and concrete. If you are wise, you will stay away from there.}
{155}{}{雷诺，一座被众神诅咒的城市。恶魔以人的形式在金属、玻璃和混凝土的峡谷中游荡。如果你聪明，你就远离那里。}
#{156}{}{A camp of those desperate, who ran away from Reno. May the Heavenly Mother give them her blessing.}
{156}{}{一群从雷诺逃跑的绝望的人。愿天母赐福给他们。}
#{157}{}{A city of the dead to the north. We call it Gecko due to the fierce animals that live there with their large packs, but "NPP Poseidon Oil" is what's written on the largest building. Be careful if you go there - the hunters that first explored it were poisoned by spirits they could not see. Niskigvan the Ruffled Feathers fought two whole moons to save their lives!}
{157}{}{北方的一座死人之城。我们称之为壁虎是因为那里有很多凶猛的动物，它们带着庞大的背包生活在那里，但是最大的建筑上写着“海神石油核电站”。如果你去那里，一定要小心――最先探索它的猎人被看不见的幽灵毒死了。Niskigvan皱巴巴的羽毛奋战了两个满月来拯救他们的生命！}
#{158}{}{Well... Our shepherd, who went far to the north, claims that there is a wondrous city in the mountains made of white stone and eternal light, protected by warriors in green armor who never rest. But he is the only one who saw it, and many think he is... Unreliable.}
{158}{}{好。。。我们的牧人远赴北方，声称山中有一座神奇的城市，由白色的石头和永恒的光构成，由身穿绿色盔甲的战士保护着，他们从不休息。但他是唯一一个看到它的人，很多人认为他是。。。不可靠的。}
#{200}{}{Niskigvan does everything he can, but I'm afraid it is hopeless. Makkon the Little Bear is doomed to be crippled forever... If he even survives.}
{200}{}{尼斯基文竭尽所能，但恐怕没有希望了。小熊Makkon注定会永远残废。。。如果他能活下来。}
#{201}{}{Leave it. Niskigvan fights to save him, but I'm afraid it is hopeless. Makkon the Little Bear is doomed to be crippled forever... If he even survives.}
{201}{}{别管了。尼斯基文奋力救他，但恐怕已经没有希望了。小熊Makkon注定会永远残废。。。如果他能活下来。}
#{202}{}{I'm a doctor, I can fix this. Makkon will be dancing and chasing girls before you know it!}
{202}{}{我是医生，我能治好这个。Makkon会在你意识到之前跳舞追女孩！}
#{203}{}{Let's talk about something more pleasant.}
{203}{}{让我们谈谈更愉快的事。}
#{204}{}{Never mind, then...}
{204}{}{没关系，那么。。。}
#{205}{}{You? [he shakes his head] Your hands and eyes speak the truth that your words do not. Don't fool yourself, outsider. You are no healer.}
{205}{}{你呢？[他摇头]你的手和眼睛说出了你的话所没有的真理。别自欺欺人，局外人。你不是治疗者。}
#{206}{}{Hmm. Niskigvan will not trust an outsider's medicine easily. How the outsider is going to heal the child?}
{206}{}{嗯。尼斯基文不会轻易相信外人的药。外人将如何治愈孩子？}
#{207}{}{With chems. Trust me, your kid won't even remember he was crippled!}
{207}{}{与化学有关。相信我，你的孩子都不会记得他是瘸子了！}
#{208}{}{Pre-war medicine. What else?}
{208}{}{战前医学。还有什么？}
#{209}{}{With my hands, of course. We won't need anything else.}
{209}{}{当然是用我的手。我们不需要别的了。}
#{210}{}{I'll take him somewhere with functional medical equipment, and will perform a surgery.}
{210}{}{我会带他去一个有功能的医疗设备的地方做手术。}
#{211}{}{This requires complex reconstructive surgery. Niskigvan and I will do it together.}
{211}{}{这需要复杂的重建手术。尼斯基文和我会一起做的。}
#{212}{}{Chems?! By the name of the Heavenly Mother, I forbid you from even touching this boy! This poison is only fit for the World Devourer's children!}
{212}{}{化学？！以天母之名，我禁止你碰这个孩子！这种毒药只适合世界吞噬者的孩子们！}
#{213}{}{Let me explain...}
{213}{}{让我解释一下。。。}
#{214}{}{There will be no discussion! Poisoning yourself with chems is like giving away your soul to the Devourer, while still being alive.}
{214}{}{不会讨论的！用化学药品毒害自己，就像把你的灵魂交给吞食者，而你还活着。}
#{215}{}{What does that even have to do with... Oh, forget it.}
{215}{}{这跟。。。哦，算了吧。}
#{216}{}{No! Our tribe has suffered from this pre-war poison before. By the will of Heavenly Mother, we will never allow to sicken our boy with it.}
{216}{}{不！我们的部落以前就遭受过这种战前毒药的折磨。根据天母的旨意，我们决不允许用它使我们的孩子生病。}
#{217}{}{Fine, we can find another way.}
{217}{}{好吧，我们可以另寻出路。}
#{218}{}{Even one blessed by the Heavenly Mother can not heal such an injury only with hands.}
{218}{}{即使是天母保佑的人，也不能只用手来治愈这样的创伤。}
#{219}{}{No way!}
{219}{}{不可能！}
#{220}{}{Please understand, he needs extensive and complex treatment and surgery.}
{220}{}{请理解，他需要广泛而复杂的治疗和手术。}
#{221}{}{Can you explain what your foreign treatment will do what Niskigvan's cannot?}
{221}{}{你能解释一下你的外国待遇能做些什么，而尼斯基文却做不到吗？}
#{222}{}{You see, your healer uses herbs to treat injuries, but the effect is too slow, and not powerful enough to reduce the swelling, or to heal the bones together. So, the injury will start to swell again in some time. It's a loop. Makkon needs alternative treatment.}
{222}{}{你看，你的治疗者用草药来治疗伤口，但是效果太慢，而且没有足够的力量来减轻肿胀，或者治愈骨头。所以，伤势会在一段时间后再次开始肿胀。这是一个循环。Makkon需要替代治疗。}
#{223}{}{Your herbal medicine is too slow. Makkon's condition will progress to gangrene soon. If we don't start proper treatment right now, then Niskigvan will have to amputate the boy's legs, or worse!}
{223}{}{你的草药太慢了。Makkon的病情很快就会发展成坏疽。如果我们现在不开始适当的治疗，那么尼斯基文将不得不截肢男孩的腿，或者更糟！}
#{224}{}{Hm, I hope Niskigvan will understand you better than old chief... But what treatment outsider is offering?}
{224}{}{嗯，我希望尼斯基文会比老大更了解你。。。但局外人提供了什么样的待遇呢？}
#{225}{}{Clean out the pus, bleed out the injury, reduce the inflammation, and then set the bones.}
{225}{}{清脓、放血、消炎、固骨。}
#{226}{}{You're going to cut him while he's still alive?!}
{226}{}{你要趁他还活着的时候砍了他？！}
#{227}{}{Under herbal anesthesia.}
{227}{}{在草药麻醉下。}
#{228}{}{Under alcoholic anesthesia.}
{228}{}{在酒精麻醉下。}
#{229}{}{Under pre-war medicinal anesthesia.}
{229}{}{在战前的药物麻醉下。}
#{230}{}{Yes. He'll have to endure it.}
{230}{}{对。他必须忍受。}
#{231}{}{Unacceptable! By the name of the Heavenly Mother, I forbid you from even touching this boy! This treatment is only fit for the World Devourer's children!}
{231}{}{不可接受！以天母之名，我禁止你碰这个孩子！这种治疗方法只适合世界吞噬者的孩子！}
#{232}{}{Let me explain...}
{232}{}{让我解释一下。。。}
#{233}{}{Gods, to even think of it is sickening! But... Perhaps you're right. Niskigvan has struggled for three moons already, and it has only prolonged the boy's suffering. Your ways may be necessary. But... I... Tell me, how many bones have you mended in your life, outsider?}
{233}{}{诸神啊，想想都恶心！但是。。。也许你是对的。尼斯基文已经挣扎了三个月，这只会延长男孩的痛苦。你的方式可能是必要的。但是。。。一、 。。。告诉我，外人，你这辈子补了多少骨头？}
#{234}{}{[Make assuring gesture] Enough.}
{234}{}{够了。}
#{235}{}{Gods, to even think of it is sickening! Bleed him out?! What are you saying!!! Oh Heavenly Mother...}
{235}{}{诸神啊，想想都恶心！给他放血？！你在说什么！！！哦，天母。。。}
#{236}{}{I'm not sound convincing enough? Well, maybe you'll change your mind later.}
{236}{}{我听起来不够有说服力？好吧，也许你以后会改变主意。}
#{237}{}{This answer soothes me. I give you my permission. But if something happens to the boy, then the Cheyenne's hate will go down upon you! Our gods will exact their punishment, and the path to our lands will be closed to you forever! As for now, go to Niskigvan, and may the Heavenly Mother guide your hands!}
{237}{}{这个回答使我平静下来。我允许你。但是如果这孩子出了什么事，夏延人的仇恨就会降临到你身上！我们的神要惩罚他们，通往我们土地的道路将永远向你们关闭！至于现在，去尼斯基文，愿天母指引你的手！}
#{238}{}{[Leave.]}
{238}{}{[离开]}
#{239}{}{You got permission to cure Makkon.}
{239}{}{你得到了治愈麦肯的许可。}
#{240}{}{I'm sorry. Let's talk about something more pleasant.}
{240}{}{我很抱歉。让我们谈谈更愉快的事。}
#{241}{}{I really shouldn't get involved. Let's talk about something more pleasant.}
{241}{}{我真的不该插手。让我们谈谈更愉快的事。}
#{242}{}{Not convinced, huh? Let's talk about something else.}
{242}{}{不相信，嗯？我们再谈点别的吧。}
#{250}{}{[He leans forward, peering into your eyes] ...children have died at your hands before, haven't they?}
{250}{}{[他向前倾，凝视着你的眼睛]……孩子们以前死在你手上，不是吗？}
#{251}{}{That was an accident, chief! You have to believe me! That kid was just in the wrong place at the wrong time!}
{251}{}{那是个意外，头儿！你必须相信我！那孩子只是在错误的时间出现在错误的地方！}
#{252}{}{Yes, they have. But I want to help here.}
{252}{}{是的，他们有。但我想帮忙。}
#{253}{}{Uh, no. Honest.}
{253}{}{呃，不。老实说。}
#{254}{}{What?! Don't fuck with me, old man, or I'll cook every kid in the tribe over your campfire!}
{254}{}{什么？！别耍我，老头子，不然我就在你的营火上把部落里的每个孩子都煮了！}
#{255}{}{[He studies your face, then nods] I believe you. This evil not typical of a man who has done so much good. You can count on my trust.}
{255}{}{[他看着你的脸，然后点头]我相信你。这种邪恶不是一个做了这么多好事的人的典型。你可以相信我。}
#{256}{}{Good.}
{256}{}{很好。}
#{257}{}{You cannot be trusted even by yourself, until you redeem yourself with good deeds.}
{257}{}{你若不以善行救赎自己，连自己也不能信靠。}
#{258}{}{Do I have sign saying "karma devil" on me? Okay, I'll go do some good deeds in the world and be right back.}
{258}{}{我身上有“因果报应魔鬼”的牌子吗？好吧，我去世界上做点好事，然后马上回来。}
#{259}{}{As if I care about your opinion. Your loss, old man.}
{259}{}{好像我在乎你的意见。你的损失，老头子。}
#{260}{}{Oh, no, wanderer. You cannot lie to me. I can see the stain upon your soul.}
{260}{}{哦，不，流浪者。你不能骗我。我能看到你灵魂上的污点。}
#{261}{}{Fine, you're right. He wasn't the first victim of mine. But I still want to help.}
{261}{}{好吧，你说得对。他不是我的第一个受害者。但我还是想帮忙。}
#{262}{}{No, outsider. We do not need, nor want your kind of help.}
{262}{}{不，外人。我们不需要，也不需要你的帮助。}
#{263}{}{We'll see about that, chief!}
{263}{}{我们拭目以待，头儿！}
#{264}{}{As you wish.}
{264}{}{如你所愿。}
#{265}{}{The evil of your actions still outweighs the good you have done, wanderer. The death of any child is greater than a thousand good deeds.}
{265}{}{你所做的坏事仍然大于你所做的好事，流浪者。任何一个孩子的死都比一千件好事大。}
#{266}{}{Jeez, you murder one child and no one ever forgets it. Fine, I'll keep trying.}
{266}{}{天哪，你杀了一个孩子却没人会忘记。好吧，我会继续努力的。}
#{267}{}{}
{267}{}{}
#{268}{}{Is that a no? You really could be more clear about this.}
{268}{}{这是拒绝吗？你真的可以说得更清楚。}
#{269}{}{You got a problem with child-killers, old man?}
{269}{}{你对儿童杀手有意见吗，老头？}
#{270}{}{[He shakes his head] Why do you threatening an old man? Will this solve anything?}
{270}{}{你为什么威胁一个老人？这能解决什么问题吗？}
#{271}{}{No. But it'll make me feel a lot better! [punch him in the face]}
{271}{}{不。但这会让我感觉好多了！[打他的脸]}
#{272}{}{I suppose you're right. I'll go peacefully.}
{272}{}{我想你是对的。我会平静地去。}
#{273}{}{Get out! May your path never cross that of the Cheyenne again. May even the coyotes shun your remains!}
{273}{}{走出！愿你的路不再越过夏安河。即使是土狼也要避开你的遗体！}
#{274}{}{Fine, I'll go peacefully.}
{274}{}{好吧，我平静地去。}
#{275}{}{That was a bad idea, chief. [punch him in the face]}
{275}{}{那是个坏主意，头儿。[打他的脸]}
#{300}{}{When playing with a snake, don't let her come too close. This is a dangerous world.}
{300}{}{与蛇玩耍时，不要让她靠得太近。这是一个危险的世界。}
#{301}{}{In other words, you don't trust outsiders.}
{301}{}{换句话说，你不信任外人。}
#{302}{}{[He nods] Many outsiders come to the Cheyenne with beautiful words and ugly thoughts. Makozid the Bear Paw watches outsiders, so that they do not do evil in our tribe.}
{302}{}{[他点头]许多外人带着美丽的语言和丑陋的思想来到夏延。熊掌玛可西看守外人，免得他们在我们支派作恶。}
#{303}{}{Do you need help with anything?}
{303}{}{你需要帮忙吗？}
#{304}{}{I see. Let's talk about something else.}
{304}{}{我懂了。我们再谈点别的吧。}
#{305}{}{I can take a hint. I'll go.}
{305}{}{我可以接受一个暗示。我要走了。}
#{306}{}{We need nothing from outsiders. But if you look to earn your food and shelter, then we have work for you.}
{306}{}{我们不需要外人帮忙。但如果你想挣钱吃住，那我们就有工作给你。}
#{307}{}{If the reward's worth it, then sure.}
{307}{}{如果报酬是值得的，那当然。}
#{308}{}{You don't need to give me anything. I'm happy to help anyway.}
{308}{}{你不需要给我任何东西。我很乐意帮忙。}
#{309}{}{What is it?}
{309}{}{这是怎么一回事？}
#{310}{}{Maybe later. Let's talk about something else.}
{310}{}{也许以后吧。我们再谈点别的吧。}
#{311}{}{The Devourer has dropped his seed among our crops. From it grows plants that crave flesh. They keep our women from collecting crops, but I cannot spare the men to kill them. Clear the plantation, and we will reward you.}
{311}{}{吞食者把他的种子撒在了我们的庄稼里。从中生长出渴望肉食的植物。他们不让我们的女人收庄稼，但我不能放过男人去杀他们。清理种植园，我们会奖励你的。}
#{312}{}{How much will you pay?}
{312}{}{你要付多少钱？}
#{313}{}{Here's my counter-offer: I clear the plantation, and you don't pay me a dime.}
{313}{}{我的还盘是这样的：我清理种植园，你一分钱也不给我。}
#{314}{}{Fighting plants? No, I don't think so. Take care.}
{314}{}{战斗植物？不，我不这么认为。当心。}
#{315}{}{We can give you 300 dollars for this. Do you agree?}
{315}{}{我们可以给你300美元。你同意吗？}
#{316}{}{Sounds great. I'll be back when the job's done.}
{316}{}{听起来很棒。工作完成后我会回来的。}
#{317}{}{Keep the money. I'll do it for free.}
{317}{}{把钱留下。我会免费做的。}
#{318}{}{Very good. The crops are to the west. We await good news, outsider.}
{318}{}{非常好。庄稼在西边。我们在等待好消息，局外人。}
#{319}{}{I'm going.}
{319}{}{我要走了。}
#{320}{}{About those killer plants...}
{320}{}{关于那些致命的植物。。。}
#{321}{}{Yes, outsider?}
{321}{}{是的，外人？}
#{322}{}{Where are they, again?}
{322}{}{他们又在哪里？}
#{323}{}{How many are there?}
{323}{}{有多少人？}
#{324}{}{They're all dead.}
{324}{}{他们都死了。}
#{325}{}{Nothing.}
{325}{}{没有什么。}
#{326}{}{}
{326}{}{}
#{327}{}{To the west, outsider. On the other side of the camp.}
{327}{}{在西方，局外人。在营地的另一边。}
#{328}{}{Five. Look carefully, for they hide well from the eyes of their victims.}
{328}{}{五个。仔细看，因为它们很好地躲过了受害者的眼睛。}
#{329}{}{This news will warm the hearts of our women. We thank you, wanderer.}
{329}{}{这个消息将温暖我们妇女的心。谢谢你，流浪者。}
#{330}{}{What about my reward?}
{330}{}{我的报酬呢？}
#{331}{}{Your gratitude is rewarding enough. I don't need anything.}
{331}{}{你的感激是值得的。我什么都不需要。}
#{332}{}{That fight really wore me out. Can I get some food instead of the money?}
{332}{}{那场战斗真的把我累坏了。我能拿些食物代替钱吗？}
#{333}{}{Here is your 300 dollars, outsider. May our paths cross again, someday.}
{333}{}{这是你的300美元，外人。愿我们的路有一天再次相遇。}
#{334}{}{It's not much, but it's something. Bye, chief.}
{334}{}{虽然不多，但很重要。再见，头儿。}
#{335}{}{Not bad! I'll see you around, chief.}
{335}{}{不错！回头见，头儿。}
#{336}{}{This is very surprising, outsider. The Cheyenne thank you for your kindness. But I cannot let you leave empty handed. Take this sandwich, so you may have the strength to help others.}
{336}{}{外人，这太令人惊讶了。夏延人谢谢你的好意。但我不能让你空手而归。拿着这个三明治，这样你就有力气帮助别人了。}
#{337}{}{Thank you.}
{337}{}{非常感谢。}
#{338}{}{That is fair. Wait here for a moment. [the chief goes outside for a minute and returns with five sandwiches, which he hands to you]}
{338}{}{这是公平的。在这里等一会儿。[首领出去一分钟，拿着五个三明治回来，递给你]}
#{339}{}{Yes!}
{339}{}{对！}
#{350}{}{To replace the earth with concrete and the tree with iron is to forget the truth of one's self. The people of the cities lost their spirit. Our ancestors lived in harmony with nature, paying honor to the Heavenly Mother and Ruler of Life, and were spared the folly that destroyed the world.}
{350}{}{用水泥代替大地，用铁代替树木，就是忘记了自我的真理。城市里的人们失去了精神。我们的祖先与自然和谐相处，尊重天母和生命的统治者，并免于毁灭世界的愚蠢行为。}
#{351}{}{But on the other hand, you still use leftover technology.}
{351}{}{但另一方面，你仍然使用剩余的技术。}
#{352}{}{...yes. But only when there is no other choice. But even what is left will soon turn to ash.}
{352}{}{……是的。但只有在别无选择的时候。但即使剩下的也会很快变成灰烬。}
#{353}{}{Something is broken?}
{353}{}{什么东西坏了？}
#{354}{}{I see. I have another question.}
{354}{}{我懂了。我还有一个问题。}
#{355}{}{Rust has taken the water tank we use for our crops. To fix it, we need parts and knowledge, and we have neither.}
{355}{}{铁锈夺走了我们用来种植庄稼的水箱。为了修复它，我们需要零件和知识，而我们两者都没有。}
#{356}{}{I can help you.}
{356}{}{我可以帮你。}
#{357}{}{That's a shame. Let's talk about something else.}
{357}{}{真可惜。我们再谈点别的吧。}
#{358}{}{Help us? Thank you, outsider, but we have nothing to offer in return.}
{358}{}{帮助我们？谢谢你，局外人，但我们没有任何回报。}
#{359}{}{Let's make a deal: I repair the water tank, and get regular meals in return.}
{359}{}{我们做个交易吧：我修好水箱，定期吃饭作为回报。}
#{360}{}{Too bad. Good luck with that, then.}
{360}{}{太糟糕了。那么祝你好运。}
#{361}{}{You don't need to pay. I just want to help.}
{361}{}{你不需要付钱。我只是想帮忙。}
#{362}{}{Well, no repairs then.}
{362}{}{好吧，那就不修了。}
#{363}{}{[He nods] We accept. Our cook will treat you as our own... But only after the work is complete.}
{363}{}{我们接受。我们的厨师会把你当成我们自己的。。。但只有在工作完成之后。}
#{364}{}{I'll do it.}
{364}{}{我会的。}
#{365}{}{Actually, I changed my mind. No deal.}
{365}{}{实际上，我改变主意了。没有交易。}
#{366}{}{You've made an old man happy, outsider. And remember, if this task proves too difficult, perhaps another out there in the wasteland can help you. May the Ruler of Life guide your path.}
{366}{}{你让一个老人很开心，局外人。记住，如果这个任务太难了，也许在荒原上的另一个可以帮助你。愿生命的主宰指引你的道路。}
#{367}{}{I'll be back with good news.}
{367}{}{我会带着好消息回来的。}
#{368}{}{[He nods in understanding.]}
{368}{}{[他点头表示理解。]}
#{369}{}{Wow, not much for haggling, huh?}
{369}{}{哇，不太讨价还价，是吧？}
#{370}{}{You've made an old man happy, outsider. All of the Cheyenne will be grateful. Remember, if this task proves too difficult, perhaps another out there in the wasteland can help you. May the Ruler of Life guide your path.}
{370}{}{你让一个老人很开心，局外人。所有夏延人都会感激的。记住，如果这个任务太难了，也许在荒原上的另一个可以帮助你。愿生命的主宰指引你的道路。}
#{371}{}{I'll be back with good news.}
{371}{}{我会带着好消息回来的。}
#{372}{}{So, how's the water tank?}
{372}{}{水箱怎么样了？}
#{373}{}{No longer will nature's tears be wasted on the barren earth. Every drop's gift of life will now bless our crops. We are grateful, outsider. How can we repay you?}
{373}{}{大自然的眼泪不再浪费在贫瘠的土地上。每一滴生命的礼物都将祝福我们的庄稼。我们很感激，局外人。我们怎样才能报答你呢？}
#{374}{}{I want to get sandwiches regularly.}
{374}{}{我想定期买三明治。}
#{375}{}{I want a whole bunch of sandwiches right now!}
{375}{}{我现在就要一大堆三明治！}
#{376}{}{Repay me by making good use of the water. That's all.}
{376}{}{好好利用水来报答我。这就是全部。}
#{377}{}{}
{377}{}{}
#{378}{}{That is fine.}
{378}{}{那很好。}
#{379}{}{Thirty sandwiches is all we can make right now. May they fill your belly for many days.}
{379}{}{我们现在只能做三十个三明治了。愿它们填满你的肚子好几天。}
#{380}{}{Great! That's all I needed.}
{380}{}{太好了！这就是我所需要的。}
#{381}{}{The Cheyenne will not forget your kindness. Few outsiders come to us with such pure intentions. May the others in this world pay the same kindness to you for as long as you walk your path.}
{381}{}{夏延人不会忘记你的好意。很少有外人带着这样纯粹的意图来找我们。愿这个世界上的其他人在你走自己的路的时候对你同样的仁慈。}
#{382}{}{Don't mention it, chief!}
{382}{}{别客气，头儿！}
#{383}{}{That is fair. Omakaki will put five sandwiches aside in a box for you. But remember, sandwiches don't last forever. If you don't get here in time, they will feed only our crops.}
{383}{}{这是公平的。Omakaki会把五个三明治放在一个盒子里给你。但是记住，三明治不会永远吃下去。如果你不及时赶到这里，他们只会喂我们的庄稼。}
#{384}{}{Deal!}
{384}{}{处理！}
#{385}{}{Actually, I changed my mind. Give me all the sandwiches you've got right now, and we'll call it even.}
{385}{}{实际上，我改变主意了。把你现在所有的三明治都给我，我们就扯平了。}
#{386}{}{Don't bother, I don't need a reward. Consider this an act of good will.}
{386}{}{不用麻烦，我不需要报酬。把这看作是善意的行为。}
#{387}{}{May the Heavenly Mother protect you in the Wasteland.}
{387}{}{愿天母保佑你在荒原上。}
#{388}{}{Uh, yeah. You too.}
{388}{}{嗯，是的。你也是。}
#{400}{}{Radio... What? I know nothing of this.}
{400}{}{收音机。。。什么？我对此一无所知。}
#{401}{}{We have nothing to hide from the one who saved us from the Devourer's children. I will show you our place of worship.}
{401}{}{在那救我们脱离吞食者儿女的人面前，我们没有什么可隐瞒的。我会带你去我们的礼拜场所。}
#{402}{}{Let's go.}
{402}{}{走吧。}
#{403}{}{This is a sacred place, but I feel I can trust one with your pure heart. I will take you there.}
{403}{}{这是一个神圣的地方，但我觉得我可以信任一个你纯洁的心。我带你去那儿。}
#{404}{}{We will never forget what you did for Makkon. We protect this place from outsiders, but I feel we have nothing to fear from you. I will bring you there.}
{404}{}{我们永远不会忘记你为Makkon所做的一切。我们保护这个地方不受外人侵扰，但我觉得我们没什么好怕的。我会带你去的。}
#{405}{}{I have other questions first.}
{405}{}{我先有其他问题。}
#{406}{}{Not now, I'll come back later.}
{406}{}{现在不行，我待会再来。}
#{500}{}{The grief and pain of this land.}
{500}{}{这片土地的悲伤和痛苦。}
#{501}{}{I have news for you.}
{501}{}{我有消息告诉你。}
#{502}{}{Why don't you fight back?}
{502}{}{你为什么不反击？}
#{503}{}{Tell me about these raiders.}
{503}{}{告诉我这些袭击者的事。}
#{504}{}{Where are they located?}
{504}{}{他们在哪里？}
#{505}{}{Don't you want to get rid of them?}
{505}{}{你不想摆脱他们吗？}
#{506}{}{Let's talk about something else.}
{506}{}{我们再谈点别的吧。}
#{507}{}{That's all I want to know. Bye.}
{507}{}{我只想知道这些。再见。}
#{508}{}{Right.}
{508}{}{正确的。}
#{509}{}{}
{509}{}{}
#{510}{}{Why would I tell you? Should not you be telling me?}
{510}{}{我为什么要告诉你？你不应该告诉我吗？}
#{511}{}{Watch your mouth, chief.}
{511}{}{小心你的嘴，头儿。}
#{512}{}{They are the children of the World Devourer. }
{512}{}{他们是世界吞噬者的孩子。}
#{513}{}{They sleep to the north. Don't go there unless you have to, for not all who go there return.}
{513}{}{他们睡在北边。除非你必须去，否则不要去那里，因为不是所有去那里的人都会回来。}
#{514}{}{If the predator steps away from his prey, then other predators will come for the meal. We can only pray for our gods to protect us.}
{514}{}{如果捕食者离开他的猎物，那么其他的捕食者就会来吃这顿饭。我们只能祈祷上帝保佑我们。}
#{515}{}{We have had enough of war. And besides, what can a man with a spear do against demons with guns and sturdy armor?}
{515}{}{我们受够了战争。此外，一个拿着长矛的人能用枪和坚固的盔甲对付恶魔吗？}
#{516}{}{You don't have to do everything yourself. You can hire someone to get rid of them for you.}
{516}{}{你不必什么都自己做。你可以雇人帮你摆脱他们。}
#{517}{}{And put our life in a stranger's hands? If the stranger fails, it will bring the anger of the Devourer to us. We cannot take that risk.}
{517}{}{把我们的生命交给陌生人？如果陌生人失败了，它会把吞食者的愤怒带给我们。我们不能冒这个险。}
#{518}{}{What if we could get rid of them in a quieter way?}
{518}{}{如果我们能以一种更安静的方式摆脱他们呢？}
#{519}{}{[He narrows his eyes thoughtfully] What are you thinking of, outsider?}
{519}{}{[他若有所思地眯起眼睛]你在想什么，局外人？}
#{520}{}{They have just one source of water. If we poison it...}
{520}{}{他们只有一个水源。如果我们毒死它。。。}
#{521}{}{Not yet, but if you bring me to their camp, I'm sure I can think of something.}
{521}{}{还没有，但如果你带我去他们的营地，我肯定能想到点什么。}
#{522}{}{No, not yet.}
{522}{}{不，还没有。}
#{523}{}{This is cunning, outsider. But you will have to go elsewhere to find this poison. We have nothing like that here.}
{523}{}{这太狡猾了，局外人。但你得去别处才能找到这种毒药。我们这里没有这样的东西。}
#{524}{}{[He studies your face and nods] The gods tell me you may do great things for the Cheyenne. Fine, then. I can only bless your path. Gekek the Hawk, the warrior guarding the entrance to our camp, will show you the way.}
{524}{}{上帝告诉我你可以为夏延人做大事。那好吧。我只能祝福你的路。守住我们营地入口的勇士鹰格客，将为你指路。}
#{525}{}{Before I go, can you tell me more about the raiders?}
{525}{}{在我走之前，你能告诉我更多关于袭击者的事吗？}
#{526}{}{Fine, I'll go talk to Gekek.}
{526}{}{好吧，我去和盖克谈谈。}
#{527}{}{[He studies your face and frowns] The gods whisper to me of caution. I cannot trust you with this, outsider.}
{527}{}{[他看着你的脸皱眉头]诸神对我低声警告。我不能相信你，局外人。}
#{528}{}{As you wish. Can you tell me more about the raiders?}
{528}{}{如你所愿。你能告诉我更多关于袭击者的事吗？}
#{529}{}{Then we have nothing to discuss. Bye.}
{529}{}{那我们就没什么可谈的了。再见。}
#{530}{}{You have news, outsider?}
{530}{}{你有消息吗，局外人？}
#{531}{}{The raiders are dead. Instead of moonshine, they're drowning in their own blood.}
{531}{}{袭击者死了。而不是私酒，他们淹没在自己的血液。}
#{532}{}{The raiders are dead. Poison is a dirty method...but very effective!}
{532}{}{袭击者死了。毒药是一种肮脏的方法…但是非常有效！}
#{533}{}{You don't have to worry about the gang's leader. He went to Vegas and he's not coming back.}
{533}{}{你不用担心帮派头目。他去了维加斯，不回来了。}
#{534}{}{The gang's leader is dead.}
{534}{}{黑帮头目死了。}
#{535}{}{Oh, sorry. I wanted to tell you something else...}
{535}{}{哦，对不起。我想告诉你另外一件事。。。}
#{536}{}{Not right now. I'll talk to you later.}
{536}{}{现在不行。我待会儿再跟你谈。}
#{540}{}{More children of the Devourer will come. We will break the cycle before it begins again. These lands have fed the Cheyenne for many years, but now it is time to leave them.}
{540}{}{更多的吞食者的孩子会来。我们将在循环重新开始之前打破它。这些土地养活了夏延人很多年，但现在是时候离开他们了。}
#{541}{}{You're leaving? Why didn't you just do that before?}
{541}{}{你要走了？你以前为什么不这么做？}
#{542}{}{We have children, eldery, brahmin, and everything we must carry. We would have been noticed. But now, no one will stop us.}
{542}{}{我们有孩子，长辈，婆罗门，还有我们必须携带的一切。我们会被注意到的。但是现在，没有人会阻止我们。}
#{543}{}{Where will you go now?}
{543}{}{你现在要去哪里？}
#{544}{}{West, to where the sun drowns in a sea of tears. Our ancestors spoke of it.}
{544}{}{西边，太阳淹没在泪水的海洋里。我们的祖先说过。}
#{545}{}{Are you sure other children of the Devourer will come?}
{545}{}{你确定吞食者的其他孩子会来吗？}
#{546}{}{There will always be more of them. But now, our tribe is wiser. We will protect ourselves.}
{546}{}{总会有更多的人。但现在，我们的部落更聪明了。我们会保护自己。}
#{547}{}{It's a little sad to leave after all this, isn't it?}
{547}{}{在这一切之后离开有点难过，不是吗？}
#{548}{}{The earth remembers. The earth will remember for many years. So will we.}
{548}{}{地球记得。地球会记住很多年。我们也是。}
#{549}{}{How can Makkon the Little Bear make this trip?}
{549}{}{小熊Makkon怎么能完成这次旅行？}
#{550}{}{[He sighs] Only Heavenly Mother knows.}
{550}{}{只有天母知道。}
#{551}{}{If I can operate on him before you leave, he might just make it. But I need your permission, first.}
{551}{}{如果我能在你走之前给他做手术，他可能会成功的。但我首先需要你的许可。}
#{552}{}{Of course. We trust you.}
{552}{}{当然。我们信任你。}
#{553}{}{Thanks.}
{553}{}{谢谢。}
#{554}{}{How soon will you get head out?}
{554}{}{你什么时候才能出来？}
#{555}{}{Oh, not soon. It will be many moons before we are ready.}
{555}{}{哦，不快。在我们准备好之前还需要很多个月亮。}
#{556}{}{}
{556}{}{}
#{557}{}{}
{557}{}{}
#{558}{}{Before you leave, I want to ask you something.}
{558}{}{在你离开之前，我想问你一件事。}
#{559}{}{Well, stay safe.}
{559}{}{好吧，注意安全。}
#{560}{}{The gods warn me that the danger remains. Did you check? Maybe the Devourer has gifted some with life beyond death.}
{560}{}{众神警告我危险依然存在。你查过了吗？也许吞食者赋予了一些人超越死亡的生命。}
#{561}{}{I'll check it out and come back.}
{561}{}{我去看看再回来。}
#{562}{}{[The chief nods and smiles] Even the heavens must have heard the screams from that dark camp! You have brought joy to an old man, outsider. The Cheyenne are now free! Not even the Devourer can challenge your canniness and strength. Our legends will remember you as Vabigagosh - the White Fox!}
{562}{}{[酋长点头微笑]连天也一定听到了黑暗营地的尖叫声！你给一个老人带来了欢乐，局外人。夏延人现在自由了！即使是吞食者也无法挑战你的精明和力量。我们的传说会记得你是瓦比加戈什-白狐！}
#{563}{}{Not bad.}
{563}{}{不错。}
#{564}{}{[The chief nods in satisfaction] Even the predator has its hunter. The gods themselves have blessed this battle!}
{564}{}{[酋长满意地点点头]连捕食者都有猎手。诸神也祝福了这场战斗！}
#{565}{}{Maybe.}
{565}{}{也许 吧。}
#{566}{}{Even the Devourer will not leave his last and most beloved child.}
{566}{}{即使吞食者也不会离开他最后和最心爱的孩子。}
#{567}{}{You mean Big Louie? Right, we have to deal with him somehow.}
{567}{}{你是说大路易？好吧，我们得设法对付他。}
#{568}{}{But Big Louie is not the only child in the Wasteland.}
{568}{}{但大路易不是这片荒地上唯一的孩子。}
#{569}{}{I'll see what I can do.}
{569}{}{我看看我能做什么。}
#{570}{}{This begins a new era for the Cheyenne! We will remember you always as Vabimakvu - the White Bear! Please, take this amulet. Remember our people when you wear it, and may it bring light to your path forever.}
{570}{}{这开启了夏延人的新纪元！我们将永远记住你，你是瓦比马武-白熊！请拿着这个护身符。当你穿着它的时候，请记住我们的人民，愿它永远照亮你的道路。}
#{571}{}{Not bad.}
{571}{}{不错。}
#{1115}{}{And so appears the woman, whose greed is more important, than the peace of our dead...}
{1115}{}{于是这个女人出现了，她的贪婪比我们死者的安宁更重要。。。}
#{1118}{}{Er...okay, I guess. But I wanted to talk to you.}
{1118}{}{呃…好吧，我想。但我想和你谈谈。}
#{1120}{}{Greetings, outsider. What guides your path to our village?}
{1120}{}{你好，局外人。是什么指引你去我们的村庄？}
#{1205}{}{You? Your hands and eyes speak the truth that your words do not. Don't fool yourself, outsider. You are no healer.}
{1205}{}{你呢？你的手和眼说出了你的话所没有的真理。别自欺欺人，局外人。你不是治疗者。}
#{1206}{}{Hmm. Niskigvan will not trust an outsider's medicine easily. How will you heal the child?}
{1206}{}{嗯。尼斯基文不会轻易相信外人的药。你将如何治疗这个孩子？}
#{1214}{}{There will be no discussion! Poisoning yourself with chems is as offering your soul to the Devourer while still alive.}
{1214}{}{不会讨论的！用化学药品毒死自己，就好像把你的灵魂在活着的时候献给吞食者一样。}
#{1221}{}{Can you explain how your foreign treatment will do what Niskigvan cannot?}
{1221}{}{你能解释一下你的外国待遇将如何做到日产所不能做到的吗？}
#{1224}{}{What treatment can you offer?}
{1224}{}{你能提供什么治疗？}
#{1237}{}{Then I give you my permission. But if something happens to the boy, then the Cheyenne will be closed to you forever! Go to Niskigvan, and may the Heavenly Mother guide your hands!}
{1237}{}{那我允许你。但如果这孩子出了什么事，夏延就永远不跟你来往了！去尼斯基文，愿天母指引你的手！}
#{1252}{}{Yes, I have. But I want to help here.}
{1252}{}{是的，我有。但我想帮忙。}
#{1255}{}{[He studies your face, then nods] I believe you. This evil not typical of a woman who has done so much good.}
{1255}{}{[他看着你的脸，然后点头]我相信你。这种邪恶不是一个做了这么多好事的女人的典型。}
#{1257}{}{You cannot be trusted until you redeem yourself with good deeds.}
{1257}{}{除非你用善行救赎自己，否则你是不可信的。}
#{1260}{}{Oh, no, wanderer. You cannot lie to me. I can see the stain upon your soul.}
{1260}{}{哦，不，流浪者。你不能骗我。我能看到你灵魂上的污点。}
#{1265}{}{The evil of your actions still outweighs the good you have done, wanderer. The death of a child is greater than a thousand good deeds.}
{1265}{}{你所做的坏事仍然大于你所做的好事，流浪者。一个孩子的死胜过一千件好事。}
#{1303}{}{Do you need help with anything?}
{1303}{}{你需要帮忙吗？}
#{1306}{}{We need nothing from outsiders. But if you would earn your food and shelter, then we have work for you.}
{1306}{}{我们不需要外人帮忙。但如果你想挣得食物和住所，那我们就有工作给你了。}
#{1308}{}{You don't need to give me anything. I'm happy to help anyway.}
{1308}{}{你不需要给我任何东西。我很乐意帮忙。}
#{1318}{}{Very good. The crops are to the west. We await good news, outsider.}
{1318}{}{非常好。庄稼在西边。我们在等待好消息，局外人。}
#{1324}{}{They're all dead.}
{1324}{}{他们都死了。}
#{1327}{}{To the west, on the other side of the camp.}
{1327}{}{往西，在营地的另一边。}
#{1329}{}{The women will be glad. Thank you, wanderer.}
{1329}{}{女人们会很高兴的。谢谢你，流浪者。}
#{1336}{}{This is very surprising, outsider. The Cheyenne thank you for your kindness. But I cannot let you leave empty handed. Take this sandwich, so you may have the strength to help others.}
{1336}{}{外人，这太令人惊讶了。夏延人谢谢你的好意。但我不能让你空手而归。拿着这个三明治，这样你就有力气帮助别人了。}
#{1358}{}{Help us? Thank you, outsider, but we have nothing to offer in return.}
{1358}{}{帮助我们？谢谢你，局外人，但我们没有任何回报。}
#{1365}{}{Actually, I changed my mind. No deal.}
