### {100}{}{Hello there, stranger. I'm sheriff McKarty. As you can see, this little town is working hard to become again what it was before the war. Well, we managed to hold off raiders and other gangs, but time is against us. Since my deputy Mike died everything is in withdrawal. We have troubles with local gangs and not enough men to hold them for much longer... I'm asking if you want to join us. Well, what do you say?}
{100}{}{你好，陌生人。我是麦克卡蒂警长。正如你所看到的，这个小镇正在努力恢复战前的样子。好吧，我们设法阻止了袭击者和其他帮派，但时间对我们不利。自从我的副手迈克去世后，一切都在撤退。我们与当地帮派有麻烦，没有足够的人来关押他们更长时间。。。我在问你是否愿意加入我们。你觉得怎么样？ -- Hello there, stranger. I'm sheriff McKarty. As you can see, this little town is working hard to become again what it was before the war. Well, we managed to hold off raiders and other gangs, but time is against us.

### {101}{}{Well, I wouldn't mind helping you out. But... how dangerous can this get?}
{101}{}{我不介意帮你。但是这会有多危险？ -- Well, I wouldn't mind helping you out. But... how dangerous can this get?}
### {102}{}{I really don't know. It depends on the situation we'll end up finding ourselves in. Mostly dangerous, I'd say, with some unpredictable outcomes. Of course, we'll always hand out some money to cover the expenses of whoever is helping us.}
{102}{}{我真的不知道。这取决于我们最终会陷入什么样的境地。我想说，最危险的是，会有一些不可预测的结果。当然，我们总是会拿出一些钱来支付帮助我们的人的费用。 -- I really don't know. It depends on the situation we'll end up finding ourselves in. Mostly dangerous, I'd say, with some unpredictable outcomes. Of course, we'll always hand out some money to cover the expenses of whoever is helping us.}
### {103}{}{OK, count me in. I can always use some extra money.}
{103}{}{好吧，把我算在内。我总是可以用一些额外的钱。 -- OK, count me in. I can always use some extra money.}
