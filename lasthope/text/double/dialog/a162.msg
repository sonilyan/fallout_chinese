After all, why work for a living if you can't buy a living. [She laughs.] But jokes aside, we're all sitting in the same boat, right? And that means we must think of our community as a whole, take care of peoples' needs, create stability. That's what Larry said. In a sense the town is like one big family, I guess. The company even got its own legal tender [she shows you some mine script].}
{107}{}{我们为当地矿工提供他们谋生所需的一切。从食物到装备再到日常家居用品。我们希望确保我们的员工及其家人得到最好的照顾。否则，人们就会上去离开，在其他地方找到更好的生活。毕竟，如果你买不到生活费，为什么还要工作谋生呢。[她笑了。]但抛开玩笑不谈，我们都坐在同一条船上，对吧？这意味着我们必须将我们的社区视为一个整体，照顾人民的需求，创造稳定。拉里就是这么说的。我想，从某种意义上说，这个小镇就像一个大家庭。该公司甚至有了自己的法定货币[她给你看了一些我的剧本]。 -- We supply the local miners with everything they need to make a living.
