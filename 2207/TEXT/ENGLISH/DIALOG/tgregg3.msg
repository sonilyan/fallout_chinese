{10}{}{A Seeker? What do you want? It's not good for Servants to see soldiers near the Herald.}
{11}{997}{I lost my keycard to the tower somewhere around here, maybe you have seen it?}
{12}{997}{Could you remind me how to get into the Olympus?}
{13}{002}{I'm on a mission. Just checking how you are doing here.}
{14}{999}{Of course. You're right. I'm going.}

#Node002
{20}{}{Wh-What?! Oh, you must be from Richards. Why didn't you say so! Tell him that he is serving here next! [he laughs]}
{21}{997}{Who the hell is Richards? Do you want to take the wrath of Gods upon yourself?}
{22}{999}{Sure, I'll tell him. Have a good service.}

#Node003
{30}{}{Okay, it's you again. Stop hanging around, or I tell Richards. No joke.}
{31}{998}{What? I'll shut you up and you won't tell anything to anyone!}
{33}{999}{I get it, already leaving.}

#Node004
{40}{999}{Empty}

#Node005
{50}{}{Uhh... Herald? Wait, Steve? Is that really you!?}
{51}{006}{Uh, yeah. Hey, Gregorius!}
{52}{007}{Steve? No, I'm not Steve. I don't know who are you talking about.}

#Node006
{60}{}{Hey... Smart-ass. I saw poor Steve being eaten by a Chimera with my own eyes. Your robe still has his blood on it. Take off your hood! Now!}
{61}{997}{I was just kidding, old man! Of course, I'm not him.}
{62}{998}{[throw yourself at Gregorius]}
{63}{997}{Don't you dare to touch me, Herald!}

#Node007
{70}{}{You have to excuse me. It's just... You have his uniform. I saw poor Steve being eaten by a Chimera with my own eyes. The Seekers are doing a pretty good job if they managed to even bring his robe back...}
{71}{008}{I didn't have a choice, had to take what was given.}

#Node007a
{72}{}{[he stares at you for some time] I'm bad at humor. Even worse when it's about my dead teammates, rookie. Okay, I'll let it slide for the first time. Our Seekers are doing a pretty good job if they managed to even bring his robe back... [he suspiciously squints]}
{73}{008}{I didn't have a choice, had to take what was given.}

#Node008
{80}{}{So, Richards is actually preparing someone to take my place? It's okay, I guess it's time for me to remember the old days... For now, you can hang around, maybe pick up some "voice of the Gods" mannerisms [he chuckles]}
{81}{999}{If you say so.}
{82}{008a}{Of course, "teacher". [smile] By the way, aren't you tired of getting here through the metro station all the time?}

{83}{}{Through a METRO STATION?! [he looks very surprised] Huh... Listen, I think Richards and Spock played a joke on you. Or maybe you did something to piss them off if they haven't assigned the elevator keycard to you. Huh... Wait! My memory is not as good as before... The second 2B card got completely demagnetized, so Richards asked his buddy, a Seeker named Douglas, to go to a place called "Army Headquarters", to pick up a spare. I'm not giving you my keycard, that's for sure, but you can wait for Douglas. Or you can go look for him.}
{84}{999}{Thanks for the lead!}

#Node009
{90}{}{Are you still here, rookie? How do you like it here? The job is so-so, of course, but you are not getting shot or bitten here, that's for sure. [starts pondering]}
{91}{999}{A wise words.}
{92}{999}{Yeah, sure.}
{93}{999}{Uh-huh.}

#Node997
{98}{}{I don't know who you are - but you shouldn't be here! AN INTRUDER! ATTACK HIM!!}
{99}{998}{[fight]}
