#{100}{}{You see a heated caravaneer.}
{100}{}{你看到一个热情的商队。}
#{101}{}{You see one of the caravan guards.}
{101}{}{你看到一个商队警卫。}
#{102}{}{No thanks, I have had enough}
{102}{}{不，谢谢，我受够了}
#{103}{}{Hey}
{103}{}{嘿}
#{104}{}{Uh, hello... Let me first find my cards, we will talk later...}
{104}{}{呃，你好。。。让我先找到我的名片，我们稍后再谈。。。}
#{105}{}{Uh, hello... Let me first deal with these decks. Why there are so many of them?}
{105}{}{呃，你好。。。我先来处理这些甲板。为什么会有这么多？}
#{110}{}{Hey, pal, it's obvious that you're freshly out of the wastelands. Sit down, take a break from the road.}
{110}{}{嘿，伙计，很明显你刚从荒地出来。坐下来，在路上休息一下。}
#{111}{}{Why so much friendliness? Hey, something tells me that you're trying to put me at the card table...}
{111}{}{为什么这么友好？嘿，我知道你想把我放在牌桌上。。。}
#{112}{}{Oh, thank you, that's exactly what I needed.}
{112}{}{哦，谢谢，这正是我需要的。}
#{113}{}{I'll decide what to do without you.}
{113}{}{我来决定没有你怎么办。}
#{114}{}{You're not dumb. Honestly, I just wanted a little win in the cards, but not against those spending lives in casino since their childhood. They will leave you lying without your own skin there, like a Gecko.}
{114}{}{你不傻。老实说，我只是想在纸牌上赢一点，但不是为了对付那些从小就在赌场里过日子的人。他们会让你像壁虎一样躺在那里，没有自己的皮肤。}
#{115}{}{[Nods solemnly and goes through the cards in his hands] The best way to rest is to change activities. For example, to play in good company. Not among those kinds you can find in casino. They will leave you lying without your own skin there, like a Gecko.}
{115}{}{[郑重地点点头，翻阅手中的卡片]最好的休息方式是改变活动。例如，在好的同伴中玩耍。在赌场里找不到的那种。他们会让你像壁虎一样躺在那里，没有自己的皮肤。}
#{116}{}{Okay, forget it, maybe it's for the best. Honestly, I just wanted a little win in the cards, but not against those spending lives in casino since their childhood. They will leave you lying without your own skin there, like a Gecko.}
{116}{}{好吧，算了吧，也许这是最好的。老实说，我只是想在纸牌上赢一点，但不是为了对付那些从小就在赌场里过日子的人。他们会让你像壁虎一样躺在那里，没有自己的皮肤。}
#{117}{}{So, what game do you want to play?}
{117}{}{你想玩什么游戏？}
#{118}{}{Not interested. Bye.}
{118}{}{不感兴趣。再见。}
#{119}{}{"Canasta", "Caravan", poker - you name it. But I have a condition, we will play with bets. Mixing, so to speak, business with pleasure.}
{119}{}{“卡纳斯塔”，“大篷车”，扑克-随便你。但我有个条件，我们要赌一赌。可以说，把生意和娱乐混在一起。}
#{120}{}{Hmm, I guess, you're trying to set this up not just out of friendliness. What happened, blew off all the money in the casino?}
{120}{}{嗯，我想，你不是为了友好才这么做的。怎么了，把赌场里的钱都花光了？}
#{121}{}{What, do I have it written all over me? Heh, I'm not going to pretend I'm a saint, you're right, that's exactly what happened. I broke loose, hoping to win at least some money, but I didn't have much luck. Look, I have a stimpak, I'm ready to put it on the line, and your bet is 100 bucks. How do you like that?}
{121}{}{什么，我全身都写了吗？嘿，我不会假装我是圣人，你说得对，事情就是这样。我挣脱了，希望至少能赢些钱，但运气不太好。听着，我有一个stimpak，我准备把它放在网上，你的赌注是100美元。你觉得怎么样？}
#{122}{}{Great, let's play.}
{122}{}{太好了，我们玩吧。}
#{123}{}{Hey, why don't I just buy that stimpak?}
{123}{}{嘿，我为什么不买那玩意儿呢？}
#{124}{}{Not interested. Bye.}
{124}{}{不感兴趣。再见。}
#{125}{}{You know, the huckster right opposite offered me measly $175 for the stimpak. What's the point to sell it for such pitiful money, if you can win twice as much at cards? But if you pay me $350 it will be a good deal.}
{125}{}{你知道吗，对面的那个小贩给了我175美元。如果你打牌能赢两倍的钱，卖这么可怜的钱有什么意义？但如果你付我350美元，那就很划算了。}
#{126}{}{Then let's play.}
{126}{}{那我们来玩吧。}
#{127}{}{The price is suitable, here's your money.}
{127}{}{价格合适，这是您的钱。}
#{128}{}{I'll think about this offer. Until next time.}
{128}{}{我会考虑这个提议的。直到下次。}
#{129}{}{Oh, thank you! Take it, it's yours now.}
{129}{}{哦，谢谢你！拿去吧，现在是你的了。}
#{130}{}{Good deal. Bye.}
{130}{}{好买卖。再见。}
#{131}{}{Here's the stimpak. Now put 100 bucks on the table.}
{131}{}{这是史汀帕克。现在把100美元放在桌子上。}
#{132}{}{Well, here's my bet. Let's start the game!}
{132}{}{好吧，我打赌。开始游戏吧！}
#{133}{}{I've already lost interest in the game. Let's leave it until the next time.}
{133}{}{我已经对这个游戏失去了兴趣。我们等到下次再说吧。}
#{134}{}{My offer about the game still stands. I have a stimpak and I'm ready to put it on the line, and your bet is 100 bucks. You still want to play?}
{134}{}{我对比赛的提议仍然有效。我有一个stimpak，我准备把它放在线上，你的赌注是100美元。你还想玩吗？}
#{135}{}{[Becomes focused] The deck does not lie. [shuffles cards] That's why I love cards. They require *skills* and ingenuity from the player, rather than simply a random number of a dice. [deals cards] I will play to my full potential. It's not just a stimpak at stake, but also my hungry stomach. So, let's begin...}
{135}{}{[变得专注]甲板没有躺着。[洗牌]这就是我喜欢纸牌的原因。他们需要玩家的技能和智慧，而不是简单的随机数。[交易牌]我会充分发挥我的潜力。这不仅仅是一个危险的刺激，还有我饥饿的胃。所以，让我们开始。。。}
#{136}{}{Yeah, let's start...}
{136}{}{是的，让我们开始。。。}
#{137}{}{[Grabs his head in despair] What have I done...}
{137}{}{我做了什么。。。}
#{138}{}{Ha-ha, if only I'd be so lucky every day! Look, as I take your... No, MY stimpak! And now I have to go. Have a good time, loser!}
{138}{}{哈哈，要是我每天都这么幸运就好了！听着，我拿着你的。。。不，我的朋友！现在我得走了。玩得开心，失败者！}
#{139}{}{I see, things must be really rough for you. Here, take these 100 bucks for the stimpak. You need them more. As for me, my loss is still less than the gain. Now I gotta go.}
{139}{}{我明白了，事情对你来说一定很艰难。给，拿这100块钱买史汀帕克。你更需要他们。对我来说，我的损失仍然小于收获。现在我得走了。}
#{140}{}{Well, I was lucky and you wasn't. In another turn it could have been the other way around. But I have to go. Take care.}
{140}{}{好吧，我很幸运，而你不是。如果换个角度看，可能是相反的。但我得走了。当心。}
#{141}{}{[With a satisfied grin, leaning back in the chair] It was a fair victory. [collects the gain from the table and puts it in his pocket] }
{141}{}{[满意地咧嘴一笑，靠在椅子上]这是一个公平的胜利。[从桌子上收集收益并放进口袋]}
#{142}{}{Well, I had no luck. And that was fair.}
{142}{}{我运气不好。这很公平。}
#{143}{}{What? How!? This can't be!.. Don't even think to meet me on the same trail, crook! Or I'll remind you of that.}
{143}{}{什么？怎样！？这不可能！。。别想在同一条路上遇见我，克鲁克！否则我会提醒你的。}
#{1134}{}{My offer about the game still stands. I have a stimpak and I'm ready to put it on the line, and your bet is 100 bucks. You still want to play?}
{1134}{}{我对比赛的提议仍然有效。我有一个stimpak，我准备把它放在线上，你的赌注是100美元。你还想玩吗？}
#{1110}{}{Hey, girl, it's obvious that you're freshly out of the wastelands. Sit down, take a break from the road.}
{1110}{}{嘿，姑娘，很明显你刚从荒地出来。坐下来，在路上休息一下。}
