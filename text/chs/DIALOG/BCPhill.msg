{105}{}{你看到了吗？！哈哈哈！}
#{106}{}{Erm... How did you do that?}

{123}{}{当然没有人。这是一列幽灵列车。什么，没听说过？}
#{124}{}{Nah. I didn't.}
{124}{}{不。我没有。}
#{125}{}{So, I will tell you about it only once, so listen carefully. A couple of automatic trains were launched before the war, just for a test. To see how it will do. So they drove all over Nevada. And then pow! - something broke in automatic systems.}
{125}{}{所以，我只告诉你一次，所以仔细听。战前有几列自动列车投入使用，只是为了测试一下。看看会怎么样。所以他们开遍了内华达州。然后砰！-自动系统出故障了。}
#{126}{}{And it crashed?}
{126}{}{它坠毁了？}
#{127}{}{No! These idiots from the railway stations tried to stop it, but all in vain. While they were trying, the war began. So, to this day it drives up and down the rails of Nevada.}
{127}{}{不！这些火车站的白痴试图阻止，但都是徒劳。在他们努力的时候，战争开始了。所以，直到今天它还在内华达州的轨道上来回行驶。}
#{128}{}{Hmm. Funny tale.}
{128}{}{嗯。有趣的故事。}
#{140}{}{Look, isn't that the chaser of runaway girls? You won't meet your kind of people often in the wasteland. Give yourself a medal, so everyone could instantly recognize you.}

#{141}{}{You're upset that the girl left your company?}
{141}{}{那个女孩离开了你的公司，你不高兴吗？}
#{142}{}{Upset? Me? Ha! Maybe I should lock myself in the toilet and cry on top of that? No, I don't really care. It was fun with her, but on the other side... Anyway, you did the act of goodness and all that crap - returned the daughter to her father. I think, it's admirable.}
{142}{}{心烦意乱？我？哈！也许我应该把自己锁在厕所里哭？不，我真的不在乎。和她在一起很有趣，但另一方面。。。不管怎么说，你做了好事，把女儿还给了她父亲。我认为，这是令人钦佩的。}
#{143}{}{Phew, that means, no hard feelings? Great. Let's talk about something then.}

#{162}{}{Gang? Well, if you have the guts, you can call us gang.}
{162}{}{帮派？好吧，如果你有胆量，你可以叫我们帮派。}
#{163}{}{What are you doing?}
{163}{}{你在做什么？}
#{164}{}{Let's make it simple: everything concerning metal stuff is our specialty.}
{164}{}{简单一点：所有金属材料都是我们的专长。}
#{165}{}{Metal stuff?}
{165}{}{金属材料？}

#{213}{}{Not moving? Bullshit!}
{213}{}{不动了？瞎扯！}
#{214}{}{You don't think I'll do it? Word of a biker - let my balls be cut if I won't open the gates from where I'm standing.}
{214}{}{你不认为我会做吗？一个骑自行车的人的话-如果我不从我站的地方打开大门，就让我的蛋蛋被割断吧。}

#{283}{}{Fine, give me that map of yours, I'll show. Here is New Reno. Great place, just how we like it - anarchy, freedom and independence. Sometimes we come there to hang out at the casino.

{283}{}{好吧，把你的地图给我，我给你看。这是新雷诺。伟大的地方，就像我们喜欢的那样-无政府，自由和独立。有时我们会去赌场玩。盐湖城就在这里――一个无聊的城市。但仍然平静。或多或少。这里是最棒的地方-拉斯维加斯。也许是内华达州的主要景点。虽然，这很遥远。}

#{324}{}{Well, let's see...}
{324}{}{好吧，让我看看。。。}
#{325}{}{Okay.}
{325}{}{可以。}
#{326}{}{Yes, I have few ideas. Do you know why the acceleration and speed is so lame? Because the contacts are weak, lots of junk between the parts, oil is dried up to nothing... In addition, I could put in some special stuff. The thing will fly!}
{326}{}{是的，我没有什么主意。你知道为什么加速度和速度这么慢吗？因为接触很弱，零件之间有很多垃圾，油干得一文不值。。。另外，我可以放一些特别的东西。那东西会飞的！}

{400}{}{这个爆炸机不会开枪。。。}

{403}{}{别管它了，看看我的另一件武器。}

#{464}{}{That is all I wanted to know.}
{464}{}{我只想知道这些。}
#{465}{}{Power armor T-51b, pre-war build. But I'm not as lucky as it seems. Some parts of it aren't working, although it fulfills all its basic functions - protects me from bullets, radiation, and also boosts my strength. There is a microfusion cell inside, powering the module that increases the strength of my every move. For your information - americans would win shit in Anchorage, if not for T-51.}

#{466}{}{No way. This armor became my second skin. You can remove it only off my dead body, so that's not gonna happen soon. But if there ever should appear such an idiot, who's capable of killing me, know this - it's impossible to strip the armor intact. In order to take it off its dead owner, you have to, for a start, seriously damage the external plating.}
{466}{}{不可能。这盔甲成了我的第二层皮。你只能把它从我的尸体上取下来，所以这不会很快发生。但是如果真的有这样一个白痴，他有能力杀了我，你要知道――要把盔甲完整地脱掉是不可能的。为了把它从它死去的主人身上取下来，首先，你必须严重损坏外部镀层。}
#{467}{}{You think I'll pull out a soldering iron and easily make what the Americans have been developing for years? Before the war, hundreds of specialists worked on it with the help of their precise tech, and all I have is my guys here - right one to punch faces and left one to hold the steering, while the right one is doing his job. Although, I would gladly started the mass production - I even found some of the original blueprints - but in current conditions it is just impossible.}
{467}{}{你认为我会拔出一个烙铁，轻松做出美国人多年来一直在开发的东西吗？战前，数以百计的专家在他们精确技术的帮助下进行了研究，而我这里只有我的人――右一个打脸，左一个握方向盘，而右一个在做他的工作。虽然，我很乐意开始大规模生产-我甚至发现了一些原始蓝图-但在目前的条件下，这是不可能的。}

{468}{}{等等，蓝图？！你有吗？！你为什么不从一开始就这么说！}

#{476}{}{Maybe, you can just sell them to me?}
{476}{}{也许，你可以把它们卖给我？}
#{477}{}{Oh, that...}
{477}{}{哦，那。。。}
#{478}{}{You seem like a capable fella, if you managed to get here and question me. There is one job, for which I'm willing to pay.}

{575}{}{好吧，我会调查你的问题。等待消息。}
#{576}{}{You promised to take me to Reno...}
{576}{}{你答应过带我去雷诺。。。}
#{580}{}{Is this what's needed?}
{580}{}{这是需要的吗？}
#{581}{}{Although I can't decipher the data on it...}
{581}{}{虽然我无法破译上面的数据。。。}
#{582}{}{Yes, I already deciphered the data from it.}
{582}{}{是的，我已经破译了其中的数据。}
#{583}{}{You can't? Ha, of course you can't. Baby, this job is for people with big smart brains. Let the real professional handle that, don't waste time.}
{583}{}{你不能？哈，你当然不能。宝贝，这份工作是给聪明人的。让真正的专业人士来处理，不要浪费时间。}
#{584}{}{[Wait]}
{584}{}{[等等]}
#{585}{}{Wait, I better try this myself. The experience won't hurt.}
{585}{}{等等，我最好自己试试。这种经历不会有什么坏处。}
#{586}{}{So, the bird now sings another song...}
{586}{}{所以，鸟儿又唱了一首歌。。。}
#{587}{}{What are you talking about?}
{587}{}{你在说什么？}
#{588}{}{The guys, that configured the robot, were no idiots. They made it to look after not only for the perimeter, but also the whole crew. Those bastards that robbed their own stagecoach look like they don't even know they are being recorded. Hey, this will be enough not only to clear our name, but to also damage the credibility of "Nevada Express", don't you think?}
{588}{}{配置机器人的那些家伙可不是白痴。他们这样做不仅是为了照顾周边，也是为了照顾全体船员。那些抢了自己马车的混蛋看起来都不知道自己被录音了。嘿，这不仅会澄清我们的名声，还会损害“内华达快车”的信誉，你不觉得吗？}
#{589}{}{They deserve it! They will think better next time.}
{589}{}{他们活该！他们下次会想得更好。}
#{590}{}{The guilt is only on two assholes, it's not fair to ruin everyone else's reputation like this.}
{590}{}{罪过只在两个混蛋身上，这样毁了别人的名声是不公平的。}
#{591}{}{Tuco will not be happy to hear this news, but they will stop treating us with hatred. And if we just deal with it silently, people still won't trust us. Our interest is obvious.}
{591}{}{图科不会高兴听到这个消息，但他们会停止用仇恨对待我们。如果我们只是默默地面对，人们还是不会信任我们。我们的兴趣显而易见。}
#{592}{}{Right. I'll see what can be done.}
{592}{}{正确的。我看看能做些什么。}
#{593}{}{We are counting on you.}
{593}{}{我们指望你。}
#{594}{}{Bye.}
{594}{}{再见。}
#{595}{}{}
{595}{}{}
#{596}{}{Your problem in Reno has been solved. Now everyone thinks that the attack had been carried out by unknown raiders, and you were accused by mistake.}
{596}{}{你在雷诺的问题已经解决了。现在大家都认为这次袭击是不明袭击者所为，你被错误地指控了。}
#{597}{}{I'm afraid that your problem cannot be solved. Those bastards from "Nevada Express" took the evidence.}
{597}{}{恐怕你的问题解决不了。那些“内华达快车”的混蛋拿走了证据。}
#{598}{}{Your problem is settled in Reno. Tuco acquainted himself with the evidence and made a public penalty. Now everyone knows that the attack was carried out by some of their own.}
{598}{}{你的问题在雷诺解决了。图科熟悉了证据并作出了公开处罚。现在大家都知道这次袭击是自己人干的。}
#{599}{}{Great job! Just what we need. I'd never thought of throwing false clues at them, and you... You are clever.}
{599}{}{干得好！正是我们需要的。我从没想过向他们提供虚假线索，而你。。。你很聪明。}
#{600}{}{Thanks.}
{600}{}{谢谢。}
#{601}{}{Okay, don't just stand there. I remember about the reward. Here, take it [gives you laser pistol]. It's yours.}
{601}{}{好吧，别站在那儿。我记得那份奖励。给，拿着它[给你激光手枪]。这是你的。}
#{602}{}{Not bad.}
{602}{}{不错。}
#{603}{}{Good job! Of course, it's a shame the company's rep is damaged because of two idiots, but why should we care, right?}
{603}{}{干得好！当然，很遗憾公司的代表因为两个白痴而受损，但我们为什么要在意，对吧？}
#{604}{}{Yeah.}
{604}{}{是 啊。}
#{605}{}{Damn, these assholes still won't calm down?! I had enough! If they think that rep is more important, let them choke on it, when I draw my plasma gun upon meeting them!}
{605}{}{该死，这些混蛋还是不冷静？！我受够了！如果他们认为代表更重要，让他们窒息，当我提请我的等离子枪会见他们！}
#{606}{}{Whoa, it's not that bad...}
{606}{}{哇，没那么糟。。。}
#{607}{}{Sure - for *us* it's not that bad... Fine, let's deal with you first. I remember about the reward. But you were not so useful as I had hoped. How much for your service? I think, 200 is enough. And that's it.}
{607}{}{当然-对我们来说没那么糟。。。好吧，我们先来处理你。我记得那份奖励。但你并不像我希望的那样有用。你的服务费是多少？我想，200块就够了。就这样。}
#{608}{}{At least something.}
{608}{}{至少有点。}
#{1103}{}{Wake up, sis! You slept for a long time.}
{1103}{}{醒醒，姐姐！你睡了很长时间。}
#{1112}{}{What's up, wanderer. Have a sit, let's talk!}
{1112}{}{怎么了，流浪汉。坐下，我们谈谈！}
#{1123}{}{No one of course. This is a ghost train. What, never heard of it?}
{1123}{}{当然没有人。这是一列幽灵列车。什么，没听说过？}
#{1140}{}{Look, isn't that the chaser of runaway girls? You won't meet your kind of people often in the wasteland. Give yourself a medal, so everyone could instantly recognize you.}
{1140}{}{听着，那不是追逃跑女孩的人吗？你不会经常在荒原上遇到你的同类。给自己一枚勋章，这样每个人都能马上认出你。}
#{1142}{}{Upset? Me? Ha! Maybe I should lock myself in the toilet and cry on top of that? No, I don't really care. It was fun with her, but on the other side... Anyway, you did the act of goodness and all that crap - returned the daughter to her father. I think, it's admirable.}
{1142}{}{心烦意乱？我？哈！也许我应该把自己锁在厕所里哭？不，我真的不在乎。和她在一起很有趣，但另一方面。。。不管怎么说，你做了好事，把女儿还给了她父亲。我认为，这是令人钦佩的。}
#{1160}{}{[They look at each other, exchanging laughs about you] Have you ever heard about bikers?}
{1160}{}{[他们互相看着，互相嘲笑]你听说过骑自行车的人吗？}
#{1161}{}{Maybe I did. You're something like a gang right?}
{1161}{}{也许是我干的。你有点像帮派，对吧？}
#{1176}{}{Forget it, I changed my mind.}
{1176}{}{算了吧，我改变主意了。}
#{1207}{}{I got it. What do you want in return?}
{1207}{}{我得到了它。你想要什么回报？}
#{1234}{}{I changed my mind. Not needed.}
{1234}{}{我改变主意了。不需要。}
#{1321}{}{Erm... I need that car.}
{1321}{}{呃。。。我需要那辆车。}
#{1331}{}{Hey, sis, wake up!}
{1331}{}{嘿，姐姐，醒醒！}
#{1341}{}{Hahah! [wipes his tears] You're really funny, you know!}
{1341}{}{哈哈！你真有趣，你知道！}
#{1405}{}{Okay, deal.}
{1405}{}{好吧，成交。}
#{1469}{}{You really need it? Hmm. You proved yourself well with these prematures in Reno and deserve our respect. So be it - I will share them with you. You're good gal.}
{1469}{}{你真的需要吗？嗯。你在雷诺的这些早产儿身上证明了你自己，值得我们尊敬。就这样吧-我会和你分享的。你是个好姑娘。}
#{1478}{}{You seem like a capable gal, if you managed to get here and question me. There is one job, for which I'm willing to pay.}
{1478}{}{如果你能来问我的话，你看起来是个能干的姑娘。有一份工作，我愿意为此付出代价。}
