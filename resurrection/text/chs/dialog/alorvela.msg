#{310}{}{Please, I don't want any weapons near Sophie.}

#{500}{}{Please, leave me alone. The last thing I need is to be bothered by some... [She looks at you with disgust.] Foreigner.}
{500}{}{拜托，别烦我。我最不需要的就是被一些。。。[她厌恶地看着你]外国人。}

{555}{}{别把你的内裤捆在一起。我要走了。}
#{556}{}{Ehh... Bai.}
{556}{}{呃。。。白。}
#{600}{}{[She pauses.] No, I'm the one who should be apologizing. You're surprisingly well-mannered for someone from the outside world. My name is Lorain Velasquez. It's just that I'm too worried to be in the mood to chat... Wait. Since you're not from around here, maybe you can help me.}
{600}{}{不，我应该道歉。对于外界的人来说，你出人意料地彬彬有礼。我叫洛兰・贝拉斯克斯。只是我太担心没心情聊天。。。等待。既然你不是本地人，也许你能帮我。}
#{601}{}{What is it?}
{601}{}{这是怎么一回事？}
#{602}{}{I have no time to listen to your problems. Goodbye.}
{602}{}{我没时间听你的问题。再见。}
#{650}{}{My son Felix has gone missing. I have no idea where he could be. I'm afraid something bad might've happened to him. He's only ten years old. He's the only thing that... [She almost breaks into tears, but manages to stop herself.] I'm sorry, you're obviously not here to listen to me whining. Let me start from the beginning.}
{650}{}{我儿子费利克斯失踪了。我不知道他会在哪里。我担心他可能出事了。他才十岁。他是唯一。。。[她差点哭了，但还是忍了下来]对不起，你显然不是来听我抱怨的。让我从头开始。}
#{651}{}{That would be for the best.}
{651}{}{那是最好的。}
#{700}{}{I wanted Felix to sign up in the imperial army. It would've been great for his future. Even he wished to join. He wanted to be like his father, even though he never knew him. The last time I've seen him was when he went to the imperial palace to see the recruitment officer. My little Felix...}
{700}{}{我想让费利克斯加入帝国军队。这对他的未来很有好处。甚至他也想加入。他想像他父亲一样，尽管他从来不认识他。我最后一次见到他是在他去皇宫见征兵官的时候。我的小菲利克斯。。。}
#{701}{}{What happened to his father?}
{701}{}{他父亲怎么了？}
#{702}{}{What did the officer say?}
{702}{}{警官说了什么？}
#{750}{}{Colonel Browman said that Felix wasn't accepted, so he sent him home. But that can't be true, Felix would've come straight home. He wouldn't run away, he's not like that. And the City is safe, so what could've happened to him? He had no reason to leave it. I think the colonel knows something. I'm not saying he hurt my son, but I have a feeling he knows something about his disappearance. But he denied that, and he wouldn't tell me anything. Nobody else will help me. A colonel in our army is a practically untouchable position. Nobody has a reason to doubt his word. But I bet he's hiding something...}
{750}{}{布劳曼上校说费利克斯没有被录取，所以他送他回家。但那不是真的，菲利克斯会直接回家的。他不会逃跑的，他不是那样的。城市是安全的，他怎么了？他没有理由离开。我想上校知道些什么。我不是说他伤害了我儿子，但我觉得他对自己的失踪有所了解。但他否认了，他什么也不告诉我。没有人会帮助我。上校在我军是一个几乎不可侵犯的职位。没有人有理由怀疑他的话。但我打赌他一定在隐瞒什么。。。}
#{751}{}{I'm sorry, but your son is dead.}
{751}{}{对不起，你儿子死了。}
#{752}{}{That kid of yours kicked the bucket, woman.}
{752}{}{你那孩子踢了桶，女人。}
#{753}{}{I'll look for your son. What's the reward?}
{753}{}{我去找你儿子。奖励是什么？}
#{754}{}{If you'd like, I could try to find Felix.}
{754}{}{如果你愿意，我可以去找费利克斯。}
#{755}{}{I'd rather not get involved in this.}
{755}{}{我不想卷入这件事。}
#{800}{}{I understand, the fate of my son means nothing to you. I'll pay whatever you ask, I'll arrange a pass for you into the City in my name, anything, just bring him back. I don't care about anything else. I don't want to lose my son, I just couldn't bear that.}
{800}{}{我明白，我儿子的命运对你来说毫无意义。你要什么我就付什么，我以我的名义为你安排一张进城证，什么都行，把他带回来就行了。我什么都不在乎。我不想失去儿子，我就是受不了。}
#{801}{}{A little financial incentive is always welcome. Later...}
{801}{}{一点经济刺激总是受欢迎的。稍后。。。}
#{850}{}{Thank you. Please, bring him back in one piece. I'll have a pass into the City arranged for you in my name. I don't want to lose my son, I just couldn't bear that.}

{851}{}{我会尽我所能。}
#{900}{}{Please, I beg you to reconsider. Ask colonel Browman, you're not from around here, you don't have to believe everything he says. I'll pay you if you bring my Felix back. At least give it a try. I'll have a pass into the City arranged for you in my name. I don't want to lose my son, I just couldn't bear that.}
{900}{}{拜托，我请求你重新考虑一下。问问布劳曼上校，你不是本地人，你不必相信他说的每一句话。如果你把我的菲利克斯带回来，我会付钱给你的。至少试试吧。我将以我的名义为你安排一张进城证。我不想失去儿子，我就是受不了。}
#{901}{}{We'll see.}
{901}{}{我们拭目以待。}
#{1000}{}{He died defending Albuquerque against those horrible ghouls. During their second big attack, they managed to break trough our defenses. Many imperial soldiers died then. You can't imagine how I felt when I found out he was among the fallen. I lost my beloved husband, pregnant with a child that would never know his father. [You can see her trying to hold back tears.]}
{1000}{}{他为保卫阿尔伯克基抵抗那些可怕的僵尸而死。在他们的第二次大规模进攻中，他们成功地突破了我们的防线。当时许多帝国士兵死了。你无法想象当我发现他在倒下的人中时的感受。我失去了我心爱的丈夫，怀着一个永远不认识他父亲的孩子。[你可以看到她努力忍住眼泪。]}
#{1001}{}{We were talking about the disappearance of your son. What did that recruitment officer say?}
{1001}{}{我们在谈论你儿子的失踪。那个招聘官说了什么？}
#{1002}{}{My condolences. I'd better get going now.}
{1002}{}{我的哀悼。我最好现在就走。}
#{1050}{}{Please, find my son. Don't say anything, I don't want to hear that you can't find him, and neither do I want any false hope. Just bring him back if you can.}
{1050}{}{求你，找到我儿子。什么都别说，我不想听你找不到他，我也不想听任何虚假的希望。如果可以的话就把他带回来。}

#{1053}{}{Can I ask you what happened to Felix's father?}
{1053}{}{我能问你费利克斯的父亲怎么了吗？}
#{1054}{}{I'll leave you alone.}
{1054}{}{我不打扰你了。}
#{1055}{}{Uf.}

#{1100}{}{Noo! That can't be true, you must be mistaken! My Felix can't be dead! [She breaks into tears.]}
{1100}{}{不！那不可能是真的，你一定弄错了！我的菲利克斯不可能死！[她哭了起来。]}

{1101}{}{不！那不可能是真的，你一定弄错了！我的菲利克斯不可能死！[她哭了起来。]}
#{1102}{}{It's true. Colonel Browman sent him, as well as several other boys, to Chuck, a weapons dealer in Hunters' Territory. Both of them sexually abused the children, but your son was murdered by Chuck because he tried to escape.}
{1102}{}{这是真的。布劳曼上校把他和其他几个男孩一起送到了猎人领地的武器商查克那里。他们都对孩子们进行了性虐待，但你儿子被查克谋杀了，因为他试图逃跑。}

{1253}{}{好吧，如果你是这么看的，你的生活不会持续太久。}

{1550}{}{天哪，他们会伤害她的！我不允许另一个孩子毫无意义地死去。我带索菲进去，我不管她有多少脚趾。在极端情况下，有可能收养来自外部世界的孩子。考虑到我的情况，我相信他们会允许我这么做的。}

{1551}{}{她妈妈呢？}
#{1600}{}{I'm sorry, but even getting the status of a dweller for her daughter will be hard. But for her, it's completely out of the question.

All she needs to do is bring her to the City gate.}
