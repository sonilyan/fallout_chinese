### {115}{}{Whenever there was any major business going on, somebody used the situation and left us empty-handed. We were robbed several times in the past few weeks. It goes to the point where the losses could pose a serious threat to our future business. I can't just stand still and watch my hard work go to waste!}
{115}{}{每当有任何重大业务发生时，都会有人利用这种情况，让我们两手空空。在过去的几周里，我们被抢劫了好几次。损失可能会对我们未来的业务构成严重威胁。我不能坐视我的辛勤工作付诸东流！}
### {116}{}{So, what is happening?}
{116}{}{那么，发生了什么？}
### {117}{}{Like I said, stuff from our stock went missing, too often to say it was misplaced or left off the books by mistake. I suspected we had an inside man doing this, even fired several people from the staff. That proved wrong soon after. There's somebody else from the outside who tracks our position and sneaks in when we least suspect it, there's no other explanation.}
{117}{}{就像我说的，我们库存中的东西不见了，经常说是放错地方了，或者是错误地从账面上漏掉了。我怀疑我们内部有人在做这件事，甚至解雇了几名员工。不久之后，事实证明这是错误的。外面还有人跟踪我们的位置，在我们最不怀疑的时候偷偷溜进来，没有其他解释了。}
### {118}{}{How can someone just sneak in while your men are at the front door?}
{118}{}{当你的人在前门时，怎么会有人偷偷溜进来？}
### {119}{}{That's exactly what I don't understand. We have several guards working in shifts, for this door only. I've checked everything... [sighs] and couldn't find anything out of the ordinary, I have no more ideas whatsoever. That's why we need someone with a different approach to this problem...}
{119}{}{这正是我不明白的。我们有几个警卫轮班工作，只为这扇门。我检查了所有的东西。。。[叹气]找不到任何不同寻常的东西，我再也没有什么想法了。这就是为什么我们需要一个对这个问题有不同方法的人。。。}

{121}{}{听到这个消息我很难过。那我就交给你吧。}
### {122}{}{Of course. This is serious and I could use all available resources. I'll make sure you get your money but only after you bring me something useful. Ask around, someone must have seen or heard something. You'll have access to our storage room.}
{122}{}{当然这是严重的，我可以使用所有可用的资源。我会确保你拿到钱，但只有在你给我带来有用的东西之后。四处打听，一定有人看到或听到了什么。你可以进入我们的储藏室。}

### {132}{}{No, I didn't.}
{132}{}{不，我没有。}
### {133}{}{Unfortunately, the cover was sealed tight from the other side so I couldn't open it.}
{133}{}{不幸的是，盖子从另一侧密封得很紧，所以我无法打开它。}
### {134}{}{Very interesting... we'll try to force it open. If not, rig it with some booby-traps and let it be. If someone is hiding down there, he will have to come out eventually, soon I hope. I'm just counting on he wasn't smart enough to dig out an alternative entry route. Guess we'll find that out too. Here [gives you some cash], $500 bucks for you. You really helped me so far. Your skills might come in handy in the future.}
{134}{}{非常有趣。。。我们会设法把它打开。如果没有，那就用一些诱杀装置把它装起来，让它顺其自然。如果有人躲在那里，他最终会出来，我希望很快就会出来。我只是指望他不够聪明，没有找到另一条进入路线。我想我们也会发现的。给你500美元。到目前为止你真的帮了我。你的技能将来可能会派上用场。}
### {135}{}{Thanks, see you later.}
{135}{}{谢谢，回头见。}
### {136}{}{All right, since you helped us... I'm thinking about a personal meeting, you tell him that. I guess we're done here, back to work then. Excuse me now.}
