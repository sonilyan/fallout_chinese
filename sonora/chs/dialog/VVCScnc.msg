### {100}{}{This is Arthur Carrington.}
{100}{}{我是阿瑟・卡林顿。}
### {101}{}{You see an archaeologist in a torn dirty robe. Despite his shabby appearance, he holds firm.}
{101}{}{你看到一个考古学家穿着破旧的脏长袍。尽管他外表寒酸，但态度坚定。}
### {102}{}{Did you want to break into the Vault? So stay here FOREVER!}
{102}{}{你想闯入保险库吗？所以永远留在这里！}

### {110}{}{And here I would settle down for good.}
{110}{}{在这里我会永远安定下来。}
### {111}{}{The surviving pre-war laboratory? Amazing! And why didn't I know about this place before?}
{111}{}{幸存的战前实验室？太神了为什么我以前不知道这个地方？}
### {112}{}{I wonder if this power plant is still operating?}
{112}{}{我想知道这个发电厂是否还在运行？}
### {113}{}{Holy saints! These barbarians have settled inside the power plant like bedbugs in an old hotel.}
{113}{}{圣斗士！这些野蛮人像老旅馆里的臭虫一样在发电厂里定居下来。}
### {114}{}{I can't believe my eyes - the whole valley is littered with the most valuable ancient technologies!}
{114}{}{我简直不敢相信我的眼睛――整个山谷到处都是最有价值的古代技术！}
### {115}{}{It looks like the center of a Burial ground. Surely automation has been working since the War.}
{115}{}{它看起来像墓地的中心。当然，自战争以来，自动化一直在发挥作用。}
### {116}{}{These guys don't just read books. Who are they?}
{116}{}{这些家伙不只是读书。他们是谁？}

#Before the escape (in the reactor room)
### {200}{}{I was expecting rescuers from Phoenix, but who ARE YOU?}
{200}{}{我期待着来自凤凰城的救援人员，但你是谁？}
### {201}{}{I am a peasant from a Villa. My ancestors are somehow connected with this Vault. And I'm here to find out the details.}
{201}{}{我是别墅里的农民。我的祖先不知何故与这个避难所有联系。我是来了解细节的。}
### {1201}{}{I'm a peasant from a villa. My ancestors are somehow connected with this Vault. And I'm here to find out the details.}
{1201}{}{我是别墅里的农民。我的祖先不知何故与这个避难所有联系。我是来了解细节的。}
### {202}{}{It's impressive that you managed to get this far. You know, I've heard about this Villa thing. But if you want to know the details, then help me finish my business in this Vault.}
{202}{}{你能走到这一步真是令人印象深刻。你知道，我听说过维拉的事。但如果你想知道细节，那就帮我在这个保险库里完成我的业务。}
### {203}{}{What's your business here?}
{203}{}{你在这里干什么？}
### {204}{}{So it was you I was talking to on the intercom? Well, your work is impressive. I wish we had crossed paths before.}
{204}{}{所以我在对讲机里和你说话？嗯，你的工作令人印象深刻。我希望我们以前有过交集。}
### {205}{}{Go so far to turn around? Well, no.}
{205}{}{走这么远才能转身？嗯，没有。}
### {206}{}{That's exactly what I thought when I led the expedition on its last outing. As you can see, it was a mistake.}
{206}{}{这正是我上次带领探险队外出时的想法。正如你所看到的，这是一个错误。}
### {207}{}{Tell me what happened.}
{207}{}{告诉我发生了什么事。}
### {208}{}{I don't think this is the right time to talk. I'll tell you everything, but first you need to finish what you started.}
{208}{}{我认为现在不是谈话的合适时机。我会告诉你一切，但首先你需要完成你开始的事情。}
### {209}{}{What are you talking about?}
{209}{}{你在说什么？}
### {210}{}{Now is not the time to talk. Pack your things, we're leaving.}
{210}{}{现在不是谈话的时候。收拾好你的东西，我们要走了。}
### {211}{}{I totally agree. But first you need to finish what you started.}
{211}{}{我完全同意。但首先你需要完成你开始的事情。}
### {212}{}{I have to get into the caretaker's post. This room is located one level above. Follow there. We shouldn't waste any time. Yes, my name is Arthur Carrington. Glad to meet you.}
{212}{}{我必须到管理员的岗位上去。这个房间位于楼上一层。跟着那里走。我们不应该浪费任何时间。是的，我的名字叫阿瑟・卡林顿。很高兴认识你。}
### {213}{}{Is it really so necessary...}
{213}{}{真的有必要吗...}
### {214}{}{Okay. But don't be silly.}
{214}{}{可以但别傻了。}
#Before the escape (as caretaker)
### {220}{}{Damn it! Is this a complete failure?}
{220}{}{该死！这是一次彻底的失败吗？}
### {221}{}{What happened? You look depressed...}
{221}{}{发生了什么？你看起来很沮丧...}
### {222}{}{Hey, are you talking to yourself? I actually want to know too.}
{222}{}{嘿，你在自言自语吗？我其实也想知道。}
### {223}{}{Protocol zero.}
{223}{}{协议零。}
### {224}{}{Protocol... what?}
{224}{}{协议什么}
### {225}{}{What the hell is the protocol?}
{225}{}{协议到底是什么？}
### {226}{}{I suspected it would all end there. Many years of imprisonment brought the caretaker out of his mental balance, and he launched a chain of procedures to destroy the Vault. The so-called "protocol zero".}
{226}{}{我怀疑一切都会就此结束。多年的监禁使看守人失去了精神平衡，他启动了一系列程序来摧毁避难所。所谓的“零协议”。}
### {227}{}{But some of the equipment works.}
{227}{}{但有些设备是有效的。}
### {228}{}{Looks like his plans weren't much more successful than yours.}
{228}{}{看来他的计划并不比你的成功多少。}
### {229}{}{Yes, that's right. Obviously, the residents resisted the actions of the caretaker and were able to stop some of the procedures. They saved their lives, but doomed themselves to years of suffering by becoming... ghosts.}
{229}{}{是的，没错。显然，居民们抵制了看守人的行动，并阻止了一些程序。他们拯救了自己的生命，但由于成为...鬼魂。}
### {230}{}{I think they suffered long before that.}
{230}{}{我想他们早在那之前就遭受了痛苦。}
### {231}{}{If we stay here, we'll be one of them.}
{231}{}{如果我们留在这里，我们将成为他们中的一员。}
### {232}{}{Yes... Of course... look, I need to get to the surface. There doesn't seem to be anything of value left here. I see no point in putting myself in further danger. Together we have more chances to break through. Will you help me?}
{232}{}{对当然听着，我需要浮出水面。这里似乎没有什么有价值的东西了。我认为把自己置于更大的危险之中毫无意义。我们一起有更多的突破机会。你能帮我吗？}
### {233}{}{Let's go. First I'll bring you to the surface.}
{233}{}{我们走吧。首先，我会让你浮出水面。}
### {234}{}{Very good. Take command, boss. I am not strong in military affairs, but I will keep an eye on the rear.}
{234}{}{很好。听从指挥，老大。我在军事方面不强，但我会密切关注后方。}
### {235}{}{Forward.}
{235}{}{向前地}

# During the escape
### {250}{}{It's not worth staying here.}
{250}{}{呆在这里不值得。}
### {251}{}{Let's move on.}
{251}{}{让我们继续前进。}

### {260}{}{What can you say about this room?}
{260}{}{关于这个房间你能说些什么？}
### {261}{}{This is the reactor level. Once the reactor overheated and caused a spontaneous explosion, destroying part of the level. Fortunately, the rock protects us from its powerful radiation.}
{261}{}{这是反应堆的液位。一旦反应堆过热，引发自发爆炸，摧毁了部分液位。幸运的是，这块岩石保护我们免受其强大的辐射。}
### {262}{}{This is the service level. There was a Vault management center and various support services. I would like to see all this splendor of technological progress in its original form.}
{262}{}{这就是服务级别。有一个保险库管理中心和各种支持服务。我希望看到所有这些技术进步的辉煌。}
### {263}{}{Educational center. The library is in electronic form. Amazing ingenuity of our ancestors.}
{263}{}{教育中心。图书馆是电子形式的，这是我们祖先的独创性。}
### {264}{}{This is an entertainment hall. But it seems that because of overpopulation, they didn't have parties here, but literally lived.}
{264}{}{这是一个娱乐厅。但似乎是因为人口过多，他们没有在这里举办派对，而是住在这里。}
### {265}{}{This is the post of a caretaker, one might say, a local manager. From here it was possible to control all the Vault systems. Now nothing is working here - it looks like the caretaker destroyed the equipment with an emergency pulse explosion.}
{265}{}{有人可能会说，这是一个管理员的职位，一个当地经理。从这里可以控制所有Vault系统。现在这里什么都不起作用――看起来管理员用紧急脉冲爆炸摧毁了设备。}
### {266}{}{This is one of the residential levels. Apart from the bedrooms, there is nothing significant here.}
{266}{}{这是住宅层之一。除了卧室，这里没有什么重要的东西。}
### {267}{}{Another question.}
{267}{}{另一个问题。}

### {270}{}{You saved me. Without you, I could have stayed there forever and become one of those ghosts. You know, after that, I began to look at human life a little differently.}
{270}{}{你救了我。如果没有你，我可能会永远呆在那里，成为那些鬼魂中的一员。你知道，在那之后，我开始以不同的方式看待人类生活。}
### {1270}{}{You saved me. I could stay there forever and become one of those ghosts. You know, after that, I began to look at human life a little differently.}
{1270}{}{你救了我。我可以永远呆在那里，成为那些鬼魂中的一员。你知道，在那之后，我开始以不同的方式看待人类生活。}
### {271}{}{Anyway, now you're free and you can help the still alive.}
{271}{}{不管怎样，现在你自由了，你可以帮助那些还活着的人。}
### {272}{}{Just "a little"? It seems that life doesn't teach you anything, Mr. Scientist.}
{272}{}{只是“一点点”？看来生活并没有教会你什么，科学家先生。}
### {273}{}{As you understand, right now I can't repay you in any way. But when I get to Phoenix, I will definitely tell my friends about you in the Cathedral of Fire. You should look there too. But it will be difficult for me to get to Phoenix alone. Maybe we should go together?}
{273}{}{正如你所理解的，现在我无法以任何方式回报你。但当我到达凤凰城时，我一定会告诉我的朋友关于你在火之大教堂的事。你也应该看看那里。但我一个人去凤凰城会很困难。也许我们应该一起去？}
### {274}{}{Of course, let's go to Phoenix. Why not?}
{274}{}{当然，我们去凤凰城吧。为什么不呢？}
### {275}{}{Thank you. You're saving me again. If anything, I can carry some things. And I don't mind seeing some interesting places along the way.}
{275}{}{非常感谢。你又在救我了。如果有的话，我可以带一些东西。我不介意沿途去看一些有趣的地方。}
### {276}{}{Great. Come on, Arthur.}
{276}{}{太棒了来吧，亚瑟。}
### {277}{}{Don't try to escape without me.}
{277}{}{不要试图在没有我的情况下逃跑。}
### {278}{}{I will be happy to accept you into the team. But what about the answers to the questions?}
{278}{}{我很乐意接受你加入球队。但是问题的答案呢？}
### {279}{}{I heard that there were some problems in the Cathedral. We should hurry up.}
{279}{}{我听说大教堂有一些问题。我们应该快点。}
### {1279}{}{I heard that there were some problems in the Cathedral. We should hurry up.}
{1279}{}{我听说大教堂有一些问题。我们应该快点。}
### {280}{}{Actually, I'm not on my way. I don't think I'll be in Phoenix anytime soon.}
{280}{}{事实上，我不在路上。我想我不会很快到凤凰城。}
### {281}{}{It's not a big deal. Take me to the nearest settlement, and there I can find my way. If anything, I can carry some things. And I also don't mind seeing interesting places along the way.}
{281}{}{这没什么大不了的。带我去最近的定居点，在那里我可以找到路。如果有的话，我可以带一些东西。我也不介意沿途去看有趣的地方。}
### {282}{}{Consider yourself on the team. Come on, Arthur.}
{282}{}{考虑一下自己在团队中的地位。来吧，亚瑟。}
### {283}{}{Then you will carry all my things. And don't whine after that. Go ahead!}
{283}{}{然后你会带着我所有的东西。之后不要发牢骚。着手}
### {284}{}{Welcome to the team. Can we talk normally now?}
{284}{}{欢迎加入团队。我们现在可以正常交谈了吗？}

# After escaping
### {300}{}{How are you, boss?}
{300}{}{你好吗，老板？}
### {301}{}{So, let's look at these equations... Oh, did I miss something?}
{301}{}{让我们来看看这些方程...哦，我错过什么了吗？}
### {302}{}{There are always not enough answers.}
{302}{}{答案总是不够。}
### {303}{}{What, do you need wise advice again?}
{303}{}{什么，你还需要明智的建议吗？}
### {304}{}{Are we in Phoenix yet?}
{304}{}{我们到凤凰城了吗？}
### {305}{}{Hey boss, it seems your route isn't accurate enough.}
{305}{}{嘿，老板，看来你的路线不够准确。}
### {306}{}{What do you want?}
{306}{}{你想要什么？}
### {307}{}{My plans have long been thwarted.}
{307}{}{我的计划早就被挫败了。}
### {308}{}{I don't mind talking. But can we dilute them a little with Latin?}
{308}{}{我不介意说话。但我们能用拉丁语稍微稀释一下吗？}
### {309}{}{Let's move on, Arthur.}
{309}{}{让我们继续前进，亚瑟。}

### {310}{}{I don't feel well. It seems to be the effects of poisoning.}
{310}{}{我感觉不舒服。这似乎是中毒的后果。}
### {311}{}{Let... Okay, bend over... And now so... Is that better now?}
{311}{}{允许好吧，弯腰...现在…现在好了吗？}
### {312}{}{Yes... Thanks, Doc.}
{312}{}{对谢谢，医生。}

#Questions
### {320}{}{I have a lot of questions for you.}
{320}{}{我有很多问题要问你。}
### {321}{}{Oh, of course. And I have a lot of answers.}
{321}{}{哦，当然。我有很多答案。}
### {322}{}{Sure. I will answer any of your questions.}
{322}{}{当然我会回答你的任何问题。}
### {323}{}{These answers are enough.}
{323}{}{这些答案就足够了。}
### {333}{}{Another question.}
{333}{}{另一个问题。}
### {334}{}{And where is the city of Phoenix?}
{334}{}{凤凰城在哪里？}
### {335}{}{You really don't know? This is strange... Hold out Pip-Boy, I'll show this city on the map.}
{335}{}{你真的不知道吗？这很奇怪...坚持住皮普男孩，我会在地图上显示这个城市。}
### {336}{}{Thank you.}
{336}{}{非常感谢。}

### {350}{}{Tell me about yourself.}
{350}{}{告诉我你自己。}
### {351}{}{Haven't I introduced myself yet? Arthur Carrington, head of the expedition. To some extent I am a free scientist, if you like.}
{351}{}{我还没有自我介绍吗？亚瑟・卡林顿，探险队队长。在某种程度上，如果你愿意的话，我是一个自由的科学家。}
### {352}{}{Where did you get your education from?}
{352}{}{你是从哪里接受教育的？}
### {353}{}{My parents taught me the basics of writing and computer skills. This is a rarity in our area, so many people in Phoenix used my services. When the cult of fire worshippers took over the city, I had new opportunities for doing science, which I could only dream of before.}
{353}{}{我父母教我基本的写作和电脑技能。这在我们地区是罕见的，所以凤凰城有很多人使用我的服务。当拜火教徒的崇拜席卷整个城市时，我有了从事科学研究的新机会，这是我以前梦寐以求的。}
### {354}{}{Who were your parents?}
{354}{}{你的父母是谁？}
### {355}{}{I think they were the descendants of those who came out of the Vault. Although they did not directly talk about it.}
{355}{}{我认为他们是那些从避难所出来的人的后代。尽管他们没有直接谈论此事。}
### {356}{}{Why did you go on an expedition?}
{356}{}{你为什么去探险？}
### {357}{}{The fire worshippers were looking for people to scout. Their interests were too much... mercantile. They needed only practically significant things-old equipment, energy sources, weapons, after all. As a scientist, I looked at things more broadly. The Vault could tell a lot about the Old World and help in the development of the New One. Ancient relics should not be thrown around so recklessly.}
{357}{}{拜火教徒在找人侦察。他们的兴趣太多了...商业的毕竟，他们只需要一些实际意义重大的东西――旧设备、能源、武器。作为一名科学家，我更广泛地看待事物。避难所可以讲述很多关于旧世界的故事，并有助于新世界的发展。古代文物不应该如此肆无忌惮地乱扔。}

### {360}{}{Tell me what happened to the expedition.}
{360}{}{告诉我探险队发生了什么事。}
### {361}{}{Not the most pleasant topic for conversation. After descending to the Vault, we split into two groups. The first one was supposed to monitor the backup generator, and the second one was supposed to go down to the reactor room with me. After the split, everything didn't go according to plan.}
{361}{}{不是最愉快的话题。下到保险库后，我们分成两组。第一台应该监视备用发电机，第二台应该和我一起去反应堆室。分裂后，一切都没有按计划进行。}
### {362}{}{What happened to your group?}
{362}{}{你的团队发生了什么事？}
### {363}{}{We went down to the reactor room and began to examine the premises. But there was a trap in one of them. The explosion killed my subordinates, and knocked me unconscious. When I woke up, the elevator was lifted up, the electricity was turned off, and the first group did not get in touch.}
{363}{}{我们来到反应堆室，开始检查厂房。但其中一个有陷阱。爆炸炸死了我的部下，把我打晕了。当我醒来时，电梯被举起来了，电源被关掉了，第一组人没有联系上。}
### {364}{}{What happened to the first group?}
{364}{}{第一组发生了什么事？}
### {365}{}{Most likely, the group was attacked by ghosts. You probably know more than me. In any case, the generator could not run out on its own. Obviously, one of the ghosts pulled out the power cells from there and thereby left me trapped.}
{365}{}{最有可能的是，这群人遭到了鬼魂的袭击。你可能比我知道得更多。无论如何，发电机不可能自己用完。很明显，其中一个鬼魂从那里拔出了电池，从而把我困住了。}
### {366}{}{I examined the bodies of your group. One of them had a gunshot wound to the head. What do you say?}
{366}{}{我检查了你们小组的尸体。其中一人头部受枪伤。你怎么说？}
### {1366}{}{I examined the bodies of your group. One of them had a gunshot wound to the head. What do you say?}
{1366}{}{我检查了你们小组的尸体。其中一人头部受枪伤。你怎么说？}
### {367}{}{And why did you have to stick your nose in dirty laundry? Yes, it wasn't just me who survived. The second member of the expedition was injured, but taking care of him would have required all my resources. I couldn't afford it.}
{367}{}{你为什么要把鼻子伸进脏衣服里？是的，不仅仅是我活了下来。探险队的第二名队员受伤了，但照顾他需要我所有的资源。我买不起。}
### {368}{}{It looks more like you were just holding the rear for safety, and you wasted your people.}
{368}{}{这看起来更像是你只是为了安全起见，而浪费了你的人。}
### {369}{}{Caution allowed me to live up to my age. And it was only here, in the Vault, that I paid the price for letting my ambitions get the better of me. But I had to act decisively, because the expedition was under threat - at any moment the cult could stop funding or send me a replacement. I couldn't derail my life's work!}
{369}{}{谨慎使我不负年龄。只有在这里，在避难所里，我才为让我的野心战胜我而付出了代价。但我必须果断行动，因为探险队受到了威胁――邪教随时可能停止资助或派一名替代者接替我。我不能破坏我一生的工作！}

### {370}{}{What do you know about ghosts?}
{370}{}{你对鬼魂了解多少？}
### {371}{}{They are victims of mutations that arose due to a set of conditions after the "zero protocol": poisonous gases and viruses in the air, the use of gas masks, radiation, taking certain medications and much more. They were in suspended animation for decades until we disturbed them. During this time, their brains have degraded. Only animal instincts remained.}
{371}{}{他们是“零协议”后一系列条件引起的突变的受害者：空气中的有毒气体和病毒、防毒面具的使用、辐射、服用某些药物等等。在我们打扰他们之前，他们已经沉寂了几十年。在这段时间里，他们的大脑已经退化。只剩下动物的本能。}
### {372}{}{Have you noticed that I've mutated into something similar too?}
{372}{}{你有没有注意到我也变异成了类似的东西？}
### {1372}{}{Have you noticed that I've mutated into something similar too?}
{1372}{}{你有没有注意到我也变异成了类似的东西？}
### {373}{}{I almost mistook you for a ghost when I met you. Congratulations, you have a long life ahead of you.}
{373}{}{当我遇见你的时候，我差点把你当成鬼。祝贺你，你还有很长的路要走。}

### {380}{}{You promised to tell me about the connection between the Vault and the Villa.}
{380}{}{你答应告诉我避难所和别墅之间的联系。}
### {381}{}{I'm sorry, I lied so you'd have a reason to save my life. I don't know anything about the Villa, or how things from the Vault ended up there. Most likely, a long time ago someone came out of the Vault, and then his things came to you. This is a common thing.}
{381}{}{对不起，我撒谎是为了让你有理由救我的命。我对别墅一无所知，也不知道避难所里的东西是怎么跑到那里的。很可能，很久以前有人从避难所出来，然后他的东西来到了你身边。这是一件常见的事情。}
### {382}{}{[Next]}
{382}{}{[下一个]}
### {383}{}{You'll have to go downstairs and look for something that will give hints of an answer. Here, take an access card, it will allow you to open locked doors.}
{383}{}{你得去楼下找一些能给出答案的线索。给，拿一张门禁卡，它可以让你打开锁着的门。}
### {384}{}{You shouldn't have lied to me. This is the first and last warning.}
{384}{}{你不应该对我撒谎。这是第一次也是最后一次警告。}
### {385}{}{Thank you at least for that. We need to see what's there.}
{385}{}{至少谢谢你。我们需要看看那里有什么。}
### {386}{}{Go back to this damned place? Oh, this is going to be an ordeal.}
{386}{}{回这个该死的地方去？哦，这将是一场磨难。}

### {390}{}{What are you going to do now?}
{390}{}{你现在打算做什么？}
### {391}{}{I'll make a big report and try to get some more resources from the cult to complete the expedition. I need a reliable guard to clear the ghost Vault and a new set of slaves.}
{391}{}{我会做一个大报告，并试图从邪教那里获得更多的资源来完成探险。我需要一个可靠的警卫来清除幽灵避难所和一组新的奴隶。}
### {392}{}{Clear. Do as you want.}
{392}{}{清楚的你想怎么做就怎么做。}
### {393}{}{A lot of people died because of you and your ambitions. Do you want to continue?}
{393}{}{很多人因为你和你的雄心壮志而死去。是否要继续？}
### {394}{}{As cruel as it may sound, the lives of mercenaries and slaves were less valuable than the legacy of ancient times. Just think what prospects will open up if we return Phoenix to its forgotten technologies!}
{394}{}{尽管听起来很残酷，但雇佣兵和奴隶的生命不如古代的遗产有价值。想想看，如果我们让菲尼克斯回到它被遗忘的技术，前景会如何！}
### {395}{}{Did technology help the local ghosts?}
{395}{}{技术帮助了当地的鬼魂吗？}
### {396}{}{No, they didn't help. So what? This is nothing more than the stupidity of one particular person in the caretaker Vault.}
{396}{}{不，他们没有帮忙。那又怎样？这只不过是看守避难所里一个特定的人的愚蠢。}
### {397}{}{Okay. Whatever you say.}
{397}{}{可以不管你说什么。}
### {398}{}{Technology has not saved the residents of the Vault. On the contrary, they were condemned to eternal suffering.}
{398}{}{技术并没有拯救避难所的居民。相反，他们注定要遭受永恒的痛苦。}
### {399}{}{What do you mean by that?}
{399}{}{你的意思是什么？}
### {400}{}{Technology will not save a rotten society. But they will generate wars around ancient artifacts.}
{400}{}{技术无法拯救一个腐朽的社会。但它们将引发围绕古代文物的战争。}
### {401}{}{Hmm... I didn't think about it. The Phoenix Society is undergoing a reformation thanks to the cult of Fire. The introduction of ancient technologies gave a lot of benefits, but at the same time divided the population... Perhaps I should read more books on sociology.}
{401}{}{嗯…我没想过。凤凰社正在经历一场改革，这要归功于对火的崇拜。古代技术的引入带来了很多好处，但同时也分裂了人口...也许我应该多读一些社会学的书。}
### {402}{}{Just thinking out loud. Forget it.}
{402}{}{只是大声思考。算了。}
### {403}{}{This is the end of our conversation. So far.}
{403}{}{我们的谈话到此结束。目前为止}
### {404}{}{It's good that we have reached an understanding. And now to answer other questions.}
{404}{}{很高兴我们达成了谅解。现在回答其他问题。}

{450}{}{我需要你。跟我来。}
### {451}{}{No, boss. Too many people. This prevents me from concentrating on thinking about my grand plan.}
{451}{}{不，老板。人太多了。这使我无法集中精力思考我的宏伟计划。}
### {452}{}{But this is not good.}
{452}{}{但这并不好。}
### {453}{}{It's time for us to break up. Then you will go alone.}
{453}{}{我们该分手了。那你就一个人去。}
### {454}{}{Are you going to leave me like this after all our adventures? Okay. I'm going to stay here and read a pocket book until you change your mind.}

### {462}{}{Maybe I'll come back for you later.}
{462}{}{也许我稍后会回来接你。}
### {463}{}{We have reached Phoenix. That was what needed to be proved. You know, if there were people like you in the expedition, I wouldn't have failed.}
{463}{}{我们已经到达凤凰城。这是需要证明的。你知道，如果探险队中有像你这样的人，我就不会失败。}
### {464}{}{What are you going to do?}
{464}{}{你打算怎么办？}
### {465}{}{I have a lot to do. First you need to meet with the customer and report on the results. It will take a couple of days. Until then, please don't bother me.}
{465}{}{我有很多事情要做。首先你需要与客户见面并报告结果。这需要几天时间。在那之前，请不要打扰我。}
### {466}{}{Okay. We'll meet here in two days.}
{466}{}{可以我们两天后在这里见面。}
### {467}{}{Greetings to my savior.}
{467}{}{问候我的救世主。}
### {468}{}{Bye, Arthur.}
{468}{}{再见，亚瑟。}

### {470}{}{And here is my savior. Glad to see you.}

### {1470}{}{And here is my savior. It's good to see you.}
{1470}{}{这是我的救世主。很高兴见到你。}
### {471}{}{How was your report received? You're not really beaming with happiness.}
{471}{}{你的报告收到得怎么样？你并不是真的喜气洋洋。}
### {472}{}{Now no one needs the results of my many months of work. The Temple of Fire is destroyed. I don't know what happened there, but the fire worshippers are now in exile, and no one needs a scientist like me anymore.}
{472}{}{现在没有人需要我几个月工作的结果。火神庙被毁。我不知道那里发生了什么，但拜火教徒现在流亡海外，再也不需要像我这样的科学家了。}
### {473}{}{Are you sure?}
{473}{}{你确定吗？}
### {474}{}{There is one clue. In the Cathedral, I came across scant reports about the city of scientists somewhere in the south, but there is too little information about it. I want to go there to find happiness at last. If you're going that way, let me know.}
{474}{}{有一条线索。在大教堂里，我很少看到关于南方某个地方科学家之城的报道，但关于它的信息太少了。我想去那里寻找幸福。如果你要走那条路，请告诉我。}
### {475}{}{It must be a difficult path. I'll think about it.}
{475}{}{这一定是一条艰难的道路。我会考虑的。}
### {476}{}{Yes, by the way, I managed to snatch some Radawaye and stimpacks in the laboratory. Take it as a token of gratitude for the rescue.}
{476}{}{是的，顺便说一下，我在实验室里抢了一些Radawaye和刺激包。把它当作对救援的感谢。}
### {477}{}{See you later.}
{477}{}{回头见。}
### {480}{}{Is this the place you were talking about?}
{480}{}{这就是你说的地方吗？}
### {481}{}{It looks like it! The city of science and progress. A real miracle in the middle of the desert. Even the air smells different here. Just what I need for my research.}
{481}{}{它看起来像！科学与进步之城。沙漠中央的一个真正的奇迹。这里的空气闻起来也不一样。这正是我研究所需要的。}
### {482}{}{So it's time to break up?}
{482}{}{所以该分手了？}
### {483}{}{Yes, check our backpacks, do I have any of your things left? I'm going to the Followers of the Apocalypse for instruction.}
{483}{}{是的，检查一下我们的背包，我还有你的东西吗？我要去启示录的追随者那里接受指导。}
### {484}{}{[Next]}
{484}{}{[下一个]}
### {485}{}{I was glad to meet you. I never thought that a man from the wastelands would teach me the most important thing - to appreciate people's lives. I used to put everything in the glory of science. It's time to do something really useful.}
{485}{}{我很高兴见到你。我从没想过一个来自荒原的人会教会我最重要的事情――欣赏人们的生活。我曾经把一切都放在科学的荣耀中。是时候做一些真正有用的事情了。}
### {486}{}{Goodbye, Arthur.}
{486}{}{再见，亚瑟。}
### {487}{}{The customer was extremely dissatisfied with the results of my many months of work. I was reprimanded for waste and inefficiency and even offered to be burned at the stake. But how could I know that there would be these "ghosts" in the Vault? And that the Vault itself is so messed up? The expenses of the expedition were not justified. That's what they say. Damn lid-lovers! It looks like my scientific career will come to an end here.}
{487}{}{客户对我几个月的工作结果非常不满意。我因浪费和效率低下而受到谴责，甚至提出要被烧死在火刑柱上。但我怎么知道避难所里会有这些“鬼”呢？保险库本身就这么混乱？探险的费用是不合理的。他们就是这么说的。该死的盖子爱好者！看来我的科学生涯将在这里结束。}
