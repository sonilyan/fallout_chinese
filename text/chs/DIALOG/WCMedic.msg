{122}{}{不，在这个领域有各种各样的东西可以生产简单的药物。你最好自己看看！}
#{123}{}{Hmm... Interesting. Apparently, the owner was not a bad healer. Well. I'll buy the kit for 1000, no more.}

{131}{}{水怎么样了？我去过盐湖，那里。。。}
#{132}{}{With water things aren't that good everywhere. But we are not a very large settlement, and aren't wronged by nature. We get away with it.}

#{133}{}{How do you get clean water?}
{133}{}{你怎么得到干净的水？}
#{134}{}{Digging a deeper well and taking water from it in a smart way. It needs to be stilled, boiled, then exposed to the sun. And a pinch of disinfectant will get the job done.}
{134}{}{挖一口更深的井，用一种聪明的方法从井里取水。它需要静置，煮沸，然后暴露在阳光下。一小撮消毒剂就能完成任务。}

{140}{}{购买所有可用的消毒设备，建造蓄水池，建立净水设施。我想人们可以在某处找到发电机和过滤器，尤其是在维加斯这样的城市。。。}
#{141}{}{What else? You seem to be thinking about something.}
{141}{}{还有什么？你好像在想什么。}
#{142}{}{Oh, nothing. It would just be terribly convenient to pump water from the ground, it's clean there. It would require a lot of special equipment to be found. And, apparently, a lot of such equipment already exist in Salt Lake.}
{142}{}{哦，没什么。从地下抽水会非常方便，那里很干净。这需要很多特殊设备才能找到。显然，盐湖城已经有很多这样的设备。}
#{143}{}{Why do you think so?}
{143}{}{你为什么这么认为？}
#{144}{}{Because we already had a few caravans coming here and asking if we have a filter for underground water treatment.}
{144}{}{因为我们已经有几个大篷车来这里，问我们是否有地下水处理的过滤器。}
#{145}{}{And? Do you have one?}
