### {100}{}{This is Arthur Carrington.}
{100}{}{我是阿瑟・卡林顿。}
### {101}{}{You see the same archaeologist from Vault 27.}
{101}{}{你看到的是27号避难所的同一位考古学家。}
### {102}{}{Thanks for everything! Meet me in Casa Nueva.}
{102}{}{谢谢你所做的一切！在努瓦之家见我。}

#The first dialog
### {200}{}{And here is my savior. Good to see you.}
{200}{}{这是我的救世主。很高兴见到你。}
### {201}{}{What are you doing here? It seemed to me that after the Vault you would go to the Temple of Fire and plunge into science.}
{201}{}{你在这里干什么？在我看来，在避难所之后，你会去火神庙，投身于科学。}
### {202}{}{That's what I did. But the Temple of Fire was destroyed. I don't know what happened there, but the fire worshippers are now in exile, and no one needs a scientist like me anymore.}
{202}{}{我就是这么做的。但是火神庙被毁了。我不知道那里发生了什么，但拜火教徒现在流亡海外，再也不需要像我这样的科学家了。}
### {203}{}{Are you sure?}
{203}{}{你确定吗？}
### {204}{}{There is one clue. In the Temple, I came across scant reports about a cult with a scientific bias called Followers of the Apocalypse. Their base is somewhere in the south, but there is too little information. If you meet these guys, let me know. Okay?}
{204}{}{有一条线索。在圣殿里，我很少看到关于一个名为“启示录信徒”的带有科学偏见的邪教的报道。他们的基地在南部的某个地方，但信息太少。如果你遇到这些家伙，请告诉我。可以}
### {205}{}{I promise nothing. And thanks for the tip.}
{205}{}{我什么都不答应。谢谢你的小费。}

### {210}{}{So what now?}
{210}{}{那现在怎么办？}
### {211}{}{Nothing. Bye.}
{211}{}{没有什么再见}
### {212}{}{Later.}
{212}{}{后来}

### {220}{}{Why do you think the Temple of Fire fell?}
{220}{}{你认为火神庙为什么会倒塌？}
### {221}{}{I know that a nuclear bomb was made in the Vault under the temple. But a spontaneous explosion is almost impossible. It looks very much like a diversion. The fire worshippers had many enemies, the only wonder is that they were able to penetrate so deeply. Hmm, obviously it was someone they trusted...}
{221}{}{我知道一枚核弹是在寺庙下面的地下室里制造的。但自发爆炸几乎是不可能的。这看起来很像是一种消遣。拜火教徒有很多敌人，唯一的奇迹是他们能穿透得如此之深。嗯，很明显是他们信任的人...}
### {222}{}{It was me.}
{222}{}{是我。}
### {1222}{}{It was me.}
{1222}{}{是我。}
### {223}{}{Don't say such things. I won't take your word for it anyway, and you don't need any extra rumors in the city, believe me.}
{223}{}{不要说这样的话。不管怎样，我不会相信你的话，相信我，你不需要在这个城市里有任何额外的谣言。}
### {224}{}{And why do they need a bomb?}
{224}{}{为什么他们需要炸弹？}
### {225}{}{All I know is that it was made to order.}
{225}{}{我只知道它是按订单制作的。}
### {226}{}{What are you going to do?}
{226}{}{你打算怎么办？}
### {227}{}{I will look for a place where scientists like me are needed. Apart from the dubious rumors about the Followers of the Apocalypse, I have no other ideas.}
{227}{}{我将寻找一个需要像我这样的科学家的地方。除了关于《启示录》追随者的可疑传言外，我没有其他想法。}
### {228}{}{Move to the Villa. We need workers to recover from the raid. And fresh brains that won't be limited by our foundations.}
{228}{}{搬到别墅去。我们需要工人从突袭中恢复过来。以及不受我们基础限制的新鲜大脑。}
### {229}{}{The villa you were talking about in the Vault, right? I made inquiries and found out that this is a closed rural community. The Cult of Fire has managed to collect quite a lot of information about you. Well, I think this is a great place for research and the introduction of new technologies.}
{229}{}{你说的避难所里的别墅，对吧？我询问了一下，发现这是一个封闭的农村社区。火教已经收集了很多关于你的信息。嗯，我认为这是一个研究和引进新技术的好地方。}
### {1229}{}{The villa you were talking about in the Vault, right? I made inquiries and found out that this is a closed rural community.

{1229}{}{你说的避难所里的别墅，对吧？我询问了一下，发现这是一个封闭的农村社区。火教已经收集了很多关于你的信息。嗯，我认为这是一个研究和引进新技术的好地方。}
### {230}{}{Agreed. When you get there, tell me you're from me. See you at the Villa.}
{230}{}{同意。当你到了那里，告诉我你是我的。别墅见。}
### {231}{}{Take your time, I'll still try to find out about the Followers of the Apocalypse.}
{231}{}{慢慢来，我仍然会努力了解启示录的追随者。}
### {232}{}{I managed to find Followers in Casa Nueva. They will gladly accept a fellow scientist. So hit the road.}
{232}{}{我设法在努瓦之家找到了追随者。他们会欣然接受同为科学家的人。所以上路吧。}
### {233}{}{For a farm dweller, you have an amazing amount of connections. Thank you, you're a real hero.}
{233}{}{对于一个农场居民来说，你有着惊人的联系。谢谢你，你真是个英雄。}
### {234}{}{See you in Casa Nueva.}
{234}{}{努瓦之家见。}

### {240}{}{I will look for a place where scientists like me are needed. So far, I only know about the scientific base in Casa Nueva. But my reputation... doesn't quite answer this place. Do you know other places?}
{240}{}{我将寻找一个需要像我这样的科学家的地方。到目前为止，我只知道Casa Nueva的科学基地。但我的名声...不太适合这个地方。你知道其他地方吗？}
### {241}{}{Move to the Villa. We need workers to recover from the raid. And fresh brains that will not be limited by our foundations.}
{241}{}{搬到别墅去。我们需要工人从突袭中恢复过来。以及不受我们基础限制的新鲜大脑。}
### {242}{}{The villa you were talking about in the Vault, right? I made inquiries and found out that this is a closed rural community. The Cult of Fire has managed to collect quite a lot of information about you. Well, I think this is a great place for research and the introduction of new technologies.}
{242}{}{你说的避难所里的别墅，对吧？我询问了一下，发现这是一个封闭的农村社区。火教已经收集了很多关于你的信息。嗯，我认为这是一个研究和引进新技术的好地方。}

### {243}{}{Agreed. When you get there, tell me you're from me. See you at the Villa.}
{243}{}{同意。当你到了那里，告诉我你是我的。别墅见。}
### {244}{}{You know, it's a bad idea. They won't accept you there, they generally have a bad attitude towards scientists there. You'd better go to Casa Nueva. Or wherever you were going.}
{244}{}{你知道，这是个坏主意。他们不会接受你在那里，他们通常对那里的科学家态度不好。你最好去努瓦之家。或者你要去的任何地方。}
### {245}{}{Surely Casa Nueva will be happy to welcome a fellow scientist. Maybe I'll look there someday.}
{245}{}{当然，Casa Nueva会很高兴地欢迎一位科学家同事。也许有一天我会去那里看看。}
### {246}{}{That's for sure. Although the way through the desert is not easy. Maybe I'll see you again.}
{246}{}{这是肯定的。尽管穿越沙漠的路并不容易。也许我会再见到你。}
### {247}{}{Exactly. See you in Casa Nueva.}
{247}{}{确切地努瓦之家见。}
### {248}{}{It's unlikely. Goodbye, Arthur.}
{248}{}{这不太可能。再见，亚瑟。}
