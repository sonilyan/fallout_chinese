#{114}{}{Then just give it to me. You don't need it anyway.}
{114}{}{那就给我吧。反正你也不需要。}
#{115}{}{Oh, I get it: a junk collector, ha-ha. How long do you earn for living with this?}
{115}{}{哦，我明白了：一个垃圾收藏家，哈哈。你靠这个活多久？}
#{116}{}{Well, forget it.}
{116}{}{算了吧。}
#{117}{}{[Instinctively puts the rock away from you] I don't... And why you do?}

#{123}{}{Aren't you too attached to junk?  You looked like a normal guy...}
{123}{}{你不是太喜欢垃圾了吗？你看起来像个普通人...}
#{124}{}{I can just buy it. Will 50 bucks be sufficient?}

#{126}{}{Maybe next time. And now I need to go.}

{128}{}{嗯，对不起。我心情不好。通常我和商队的人相处得很好。}
#{129}{}{Ah yes, it's you... Other caravaneers told me about you. They say, you helped someone of us. Alright. Here's the rock, take it. I don't need it anyway.}
{129}{}{啊，是的，是你...其他商队的人告诉我你的事。他们说，你帮助了我们中的一个人。好吧。这是石头，拿着。反正我也不需要。}
#{130}{}{Thanks, friend.}

#{134}{}{You serious? How surprising... Okay, let's do it this way.}
{134}{}{你说真的？真令人惊讶...好吧，就这样吧。}
#{135}{}{Here's the money. Now give me the rock.}
{135}{}{这是钱。把石头给我。}
#{136}{}{Pay money for this garbage?! Nah, probably some blackout... We'll talk later, when I come back to normal.}
{136}{}{付钱买这些垃圾？！不，可能是停电了...等我恢复正常后再谈。}
#{137}{}{And you really believed that? What kind of idiot would buy this worthless piece of junk? Think about it and hand it over peacefully.}
{137}{}{你真的相信吗？什么白痴会买这毫无价值的垃圾？想一想，和平地交出来。}
#{138}{}{[Squeezes the rock in his fist] Forget it. And why are you so fond of this rock all of a sudden? I don't like it.}

#{141}{}{Well then, watch and wonder how nice amount of money walks away from you, loser. [walk away]}
{141}{}{好吧，那么，看看并想知道有多少钱从你身边溜走，失败者。[走开]}
#{142}{}{Actually I lied about the money. Maybe, we'll play cards?}
{142}{}{实际上我在钱的问题上撒了谎。也许，我们会打牌？}
#{143}{}{[Pulls cards out of his pocket, thinks a bit looking at you frowningly, then still puts a pack on the table] We'll play fair. If I find out that you are cheating - your loss.}
{143}{}{[从口袋里掏出纸牌，皱着眉头看了你一眼，然后还在桌上放了一包]我们公平竞争。如果我发现你作弊-你的损失。}
#{144}{}{Okay. Let's do it...}
{144}{}{可以。我们开始吧...}
#{145}{}{Hey, why don't I just buy a rock for 50 bucks?}
{145}{}{嘿，我为什么不花50块买块石头呢？}
#{146}{}{Not so fast. Place your bet of first 5 bucks or I won't play.}
{146}{}{别那么快。先下注5块，不然我就不玩了。}
#{147}{}{Okay-okay. I'll win anyway.}
{147}{}{好吧，好吧。反正我会赢的。}
#{148}{}{You know, I'd jump right into a card game any time, but I need to do some things first. We'll play later.}

#{150}{}{Yes, I'll achieve what I want! Let's do it again...}
{150}{}{是的，我会实现我想要的！我们再来一次...}
#{151}{}{Phew... It was a good game. I'm even exhausted a bit, from stress. Here's your fair prize.}

{154}{}{拿去吧。反正我也不需要。}
#{155}{}{Bye.}
{155}{}{再见。}
#{156}{}{I see you have unhealthy craving for hoarding. I should go away, in case you'll turn out to be aggressive, all of a sudden.}
{156}{}{我看到你对囤积有不健康的渴望。我该走了，以防你突然变得咄咄逼人。}
#{157}{}{Then I don't need it. Good luck.}
{157}{}{那我就不需要了。祝你好运。}
#{158}{}{Whatever you say. Guard. We'll leave it at that and part ways.}
{158}{}{不管你说什么。守卫。我们就这样分手吧。}
#{159}{}{I don't ask you about what it looks like. Though, can't expect anything different from you. Bye.}

{161}{}{我也是。所以让我们结束这毫无意义的谈话。}
#{162}{}{[Blushes from anger] I AM - A CARAVAN - GUARD!!! I'm not a hobo! And not the junk collector! You want this rock, yes? You want?! Then TAKE IT! [throws it in the far end of the room]}
{162}{}{[愤怒的脸红]我是一个大篷车守卫！！！我不是流浪汉！而不是垃圾收集者！你想要这块石头，是吗？你想要什么？！那就拿去吧！[把它扔到房间的另一端]}

{163}{}{嘿，别紧张！哦，伙计...现在我要到处找...}
