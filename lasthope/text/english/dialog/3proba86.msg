{100}{}{Hi, stranger. I'm Sebastian and this would be my... office. Is there any particular reason why you came here?}
{101}{}{Don't know. What do you do?}
{102}{}{What is this building?}
{103}{}{Nope, have a nice day.}
#answer to 101...
{104}{}{I... "do" lots of things. Since my early days I played with lockpicks quite often, even learned a few tricks in
 the meantime. For a while I did small time burglaries, pick pocketing... but I always had a secret obsession with
 handguns. So I tried a more profitable profession instead. It's amazing how someone can earn a fortune these days just
 by having a gun and some luck.}
{105}{}{Are you still in the lock-picking business?}
{106}{}{I know a gun is a necessity these days but I don't think luck has anything to do with it.}
#business...
{107}{}{Not as much as a few years ago, but from time to time people still ask me to do some dirty work for them.
 The truth is, I can hardly earn enough these days. Either this town is full of greedy bastards or it's time to move on,
 or both. [Chuckles.]}
{108}{}{Interesting. Thanks for your time.}
#man with the gun... 106
{109}{}{Hah! [Laughs.] That's what I call a mercenary job. We stopped doing that though. Situation was horrible. At
 first, the whole "easy money" idea sounded too good to be true. But in the end, when you add up all the numbers on a
 piece of paper, cheap death was all you got. Can't look forward to that.}
{110}{}{What happened later?}
#in present... 110
{111}{}{Couldn't find a more respectable job and we struggled for a while... With no income, it was a matter of time
 before our group was going to fall apart. Just out of nowhere, came this mayor man and offered us a deal. My guys
 patrol around the city, take out any bandits or raiders and get paid wages. Well, at least we are doing something
 useful.}
{112}{}{Yep, let me ask you something else.}
{113}{}{Yeah, you're right about that. I'll be going now.}
#this place huge... 102
{114}{}{It used to be the city's council building, but it has been abandoned for some time. The west side is mostly
 ruined but the whole place is so huge, there is more space than we need. Still, we tried to ask for donations
 to rebuild the damaged parts of the building...}
{115}{}{Did you get any help?}
#
{116}{}{Nobody wanted to help. But as always, "concerned" mayor Donson promised some money... But as time
 moved on, his support faded slowly like that money he promised. We worked all day and night and didn't get a
 fucking dime. He will pay eventually for all the people he fooled. As soon as we get our financial situation under
 control, we are out of here.}
{117}{}{Thanks for your time.}
#this place 2nd time...
{118}{}{It was the city's council building, but it has been abandoned for some time. We moved in and tried to raise
 some money for repairs, but never managed to see it through. We won't be staying here for long though. Things will
 get better and then we are out of here.}
{119}{}{If you say so. Let me ask you something else.}
#
{120}{}{Welcome back. Please take a seat and tell me what you want.}
#
{121}{}{Ask about what?}
#
{122}{}{Two citizens were killed recently. Do you  know anything about that?}
#
{123}{}{Guess I do, although it depends on what information you are looking for. But it's most likely, we're talking
 about the same event. Either way, I'll start with what I know and we'll continue from there... Not long ago I saw this
 terrible thing happening. Two people were killed close to the west side of the building, about one hour after sunset,
 I'd say. I had my men ordered to remain on their positions for the night because there could be raiders hiding in the
 forest. So we sat there and watched the whole thing...}
{124}{}{I need more details, tell me what happened.}
#
{125}{}{There were two guys with large suitcases, anxiously waiting for someone. Couple of minutes later, a group of
 four approached. They exchanged a few small packages which, I suppose, were money or drugs. Then they split up, but
 after a few dozen feet or so, someone drew a gun and the next thing I know all hell broke loose. Guns flashing all
 over the forest... Looked like a damn war zone.}
{126}{}{Drug dealers you say...? This is not good at all. Do you know where they came from?}
#
{127}{}{I believe from the south, saw some flashlights from that direction just before they approached the campfire at
 the meeting point. I'm not sure which way they went later... Like I told you, it was getting dark and the forest is dense
 in these parts, so it was impossible to track them down.}
{128}{}{Thanks Sebastian, you've been very helpful.}
