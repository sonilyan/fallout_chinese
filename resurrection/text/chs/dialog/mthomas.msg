#{2350}{}{You have to try! Don't you understand?

Their dedication is so strong that they can barely be stopped, and they're still growing strong. The numbers of the Rebirth are growing and they're able to acquire more deadly weapons.

In the main Rebirth base, a pre-war research facility, there's a machine that can cure tissue damaged by radiation. It can turn a ghoul into a normal, healthy human.

He was the first. The fact that he was able to do that all by himself was something so amazing that it was probably the reason why he became our leader, instead of us taking revenge on him when he told us that he probably damaged the machine during his treatment, delaying the rebirth for all of us.}

We didn't find any records about the machine so we assumed that the computer was bugged or damaged. But the complex was shut down without any problems, without any damage, somebody deleted the files, but I managed to save at least something. I found out that the Savior is lying!}
{4850}{}{这台机器再也不能工作得更好了！根本不行。组织退化是不可避免的，对此无能为力。我们在寻找一个根本不存在的缺陷，我们在试图修复一台没有坏掉的机器。我们没有找到关于这台机器的任何记录，所以我们认为这台电脑被窃听或损坏了。但是这个综合设施被关闭了，没有任何问题，没有任何损坏，有人删除了文件，但我至少保存了一些东西。我发现救世主在撒谎！}
#{4851}{}{Savior noo!}
{4851}{}{救世主！}
#{4860}{}{I don't know why, I have no idea what his deal is, but he couldn't have survived for so long had he transplanted tissues from the laboratory supplies. Maybe some people came along with him with minimum radiation damage, in that case he could be alive even today. It might be the case. Anyway, he is destined to die of cell structure decay as well. I was trying to prove it to my colleagues, but of course they didn't believe me, much on the contrary, I lived in fear of being declared a traitor, so I ran away. I was hoping that I would find somebody who would be able to stop it. Maybe I was even hoping to find you.}
{4860}{}{我不知道为什么，我不知道他的交易是什么，但他不可能存活这么久，如果他从实验室移植组织供应。也许有人带着最小的辐射损伤和他一起来，那样的话，他甚至可以活到今天。可能是这样。不管怎样，他注定也会死于细胞结构的衰退。我想向我的同事证明这一点，但他们当然不相信我，恰恰相反，我生活在被宣布为叛徒的恐惧中，所以我逃跑了。我希望我能找到一个能阻止它的人。也许我甚至希望能找到你。}
#{4861}{}{Huuuuh...}
{4861}{}{呃……}
#{4900}{}{I'm so happy to see you again. I'm glad that you're still alive, but I'm worried about your condition. I don't know if you understood anything I was trying to tell you and if you understand how serious the situation is. [Cough.] They will continue to try to fix the machine, to run tests on kidnapped humans, and soldiers of the Rebirth will continue to kidnap more until they have enough to provide the rebirth for everybody. And if they use the machine they sacrifice their lives as well, because they won't be able to survive for long. Their dedication is so strong that they can barely be stopped, and they're still growing strong. The numbers of the Rebirth are growing and they're able to acquire more deadly weapons. That's the sign of destruction for all humans, normals and ghouls. [Moaning.] What have we done... You have to stop it, I can't do anything anymore, you might.}
{4900}{}{很高兴再次见到你。我很高兴你还活着，但我担心你的情况。我不知道你是否明白我想告诉你的任何事情，你是否明白情况有多严重。[咳嗽]他们将继续尝试修理机器，对被绑架的人进行测试，重生的士兵将继续绑架更多的人，直到他们有足够的钱为每个人提供重生。如果他们使用这台机器，他们也会牺牲自己的生命，因为他们活不了多久。他们的献身精神是如此强烈，以至于他们几乎无法被阻止，而且他们仍然在不断壮大。重生的人数正在增加，他们能够获得更多致命武器。这是所有人类、普通人和僵尸毁灭的标志。我们做了什么……你必须停止，我不能再做任何事了，你可以。}
#{4901}{}{ shoo all da bad thing?}
{4901}{}{什么坏事？}
#{4950}{}{You have to kill... No, the death of the Savior wouldn't stop them. You have to destroy the machine of the Rebirth and the whole research facility to prevent anybody from trying something like this again, then it will be over. [Cough.] We ghouls are destined to suffer, there's nothing to be done about it.}
{4950}{}{你必须杀了……不，救世主的死并不能阻止他们。你必须摧毁重生的机器和整个研究设施，以防止任何人再次尝试这样的事情，然后它就会结束。[咳嗽]我们僵尸注定要受苦，对此我们无能为力。}
#{4951}{}{Okey dokey.}
{4951}{}{好的，多基。}
#{5000}{}{Show me the map, here's the Rebirth base. [With much effort and in obvious pain he raises a hand full of bruises and points on the map with his only unbroken finger.] If you show them the talisman of the Rebirth and tell them the password 'New life', they'll let you through. You just have to wear something that covers your whole body, so they won't notice that you're not a ghoul. A robe or power armor, perhaps. During my escape I hid my robe in a pile of stones near the entrance, to look more inconspicuous during my travels. Maybe you'll be able to find it.}
{5000}{}{给我看地图，这是重生基地。[他使出浑身解数，痛苦万分，举起一只满是瘀伤的手，用他唯一一根未断的手指指着地图]如果你给他们看重生的护身符，告诉他们“新生命”的密码，他们会让你通过。你只要穿一件能遮住全身的衣服，他们就不会注意到你不是僵尸。也许是长袍或是护甲。在我逃跑的时候，我把我的长袍藏在入口附近的一堆石头里，以便在旅途中显得更加不显眼。也许你能找到它。}
#{5001}{}{Noo shiny thingy.}
{5001}{}{没有闪亮的东西。}
#{5002}{}{Goood.}
{5002}{}{好好。}
#{5050}{}{I can't help you anymore, it's on you, I'm sorry my friend. You did a lot, you survived and you came a long way despite your condition. Maybe you can do even something so impossible as stopping the Rebirth. I wish you luck, goodbye.}
{5050}{}{我再也帮不了你了，全靠你了，对不起我的朋友。你做了很多，你活了下来，尽管你的情况很糟糕，你还是走了很长的路。也许你甚至可以做一些不可能的事，比如停止重生。祝你好运，再见。}
#{5051}{}{Bye bye.}
{5051}{}{再见。}
#{5100}{}{Here, take my talisman, I won't need it anymore. [He gives you a shiny thing, but it's not very shiny because it's covered in blood.]}
{5100}{}{拿着我的护身符，我不再需要它了。[他给了你一个闪亮的东西，但它不是很闪亮，因为它浑身是血。]}
#{5101}{}{Yeah, shiny.}
{5101}{}{是的，很闪亮。}
