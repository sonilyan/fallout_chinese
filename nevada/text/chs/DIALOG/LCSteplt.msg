#{100}{}{You see an outcast.}
{100}{}{你看到一个被遗弃的人。}
#{101}{}{You see Stapleton.}
{101}{}{你看斯台普顿。}
#{102}{}{You see a lonely one-eyed resident of the slums.}
{102}{}{你看到贫民窟里一个孤独的独眼居民。}
#{103}{}{You see a lone and mysterious Stapleton... Though he mostly resembles a typical beggar.}
{103}{}{你看到一个孤独而神秘的斯台普顿...虽然他很像一个典型的乞丐。}
#{110}{}{[The man you see is of a strong build, with an ugly face, that is missing an eye] That's my home, and here I live. Are you sure you came to the right place?}
{110}{}{[你看到的那个男人体格健壮，长着一张丑陋的脸，缺了一只眼睛]那是我的家，我住在这里。你确定你来对地方了吗？}
#{111}{}{Well, usually nobody stops by here...}
{111}{}{嗯，通常没人会在这里停留...}
#{112}{}{Okay, I'm leaving.}
{112}{}{好吧，我要走了。}
#{113}{}{I see...}
{113}{}{我懂了...}
#{120}{}{May I ask who I am talking to?}
{120}{}{请问我在和谁说话？}
#{121}{}{Why'd you need to know? Usually, everybody just turn away from me. And if they do want to get acquainted, it spells trouble. Better just go do your thing.}
{121}{}{你为什么要知道？通常，每个人都会离开我。如果他们真的想认识，那就麻烦了。最好去做你该做的。}
#{122}{}{But still. Your name is not a secret, is it?}
{122}{}{但仍然如此。你的名字不是秘密，是吗？}
#{123}{}{Wow, you sure are one unsociable fella...}
{123}{}{哇，你真是个不善交际的家伙...}
#{124}{}{[For a bit, the outcast is just staring at you with his one eye] They used to call me Mr. Stapleton. Now though, nobody calls me nothing. All they do is telling me to get lost, that's why I just sit here alone and don't go out to town anymore. Nobody comes to visit me either.}
{124}{}{[有一段时间，被放逐者只是用一只眼睛盯着你]他们以前叫我斯台普顿先生。不过，现在没人叫我什么都不说。他们所做的就是让我迷路，这就是为什么我一个人坐在这里，不再出城。也没人来看我。}
#{125}{}{So you did it to yourself, right... Hiding I mean?}
{125}{}{所以你对自己做了，对吧...我是说藏起来？}
#{126}{}{[He seems to think long and hard about the answer] I guess... It's hard to talk to people when they already have a certain opinion of you without ever exchanging a single word.}
{126}{}{[他似乎在认真思考答案]我想...当人们已经对你有了某种看法时，你很难不说一句话就和他们交谈。}
#{127}{}{Why do they treat you like that?}
{127}{}{他们为什么那样对待你？}
#{128}{}{Reputation of a former criminal. It was long time ago, when the Nuka-Cola factory had just been opened. I was doing maintenance, and during one unfortunate accident my face had been badly disfigured. That's why people began to avoid me. I fell into a bad pattern of heavy drinking, got involved with a small-time gang and stole a bunch of stuff from that same factory. It was an unstable time for the city, when you could've been jumped by a thug from each and every corner. You know, what's done is done, but people still remember the bad old me. Only the sheriff learned not to judge the others by their past.}
{128}{}{前罪犯的名声。那是很久以前，努卡可乐厂刚刚开业。我在做保养，在一次不幸的事故中，我的脸严重毁容。这就是为什么人们开始回避我。我陷入了酗酒的坏习惯，和一个小帮派混在一起，从同一家工厂偷了一堆东西。这是一个城市不稳定的时期，你可能会被一个暴徒从每个角落跳下。你知道，已经做了的事已经做了，但是人们仍然记得那个坏的老我。只有警长学会了不以别人的过去来评判他们。}
#{129}{}{So, the sheriff was able to accept even a former criminal?}
{129}{}{那么，警长能接受一个前罪犯吗？}
#{130}{}{That's right. He's a fair guy.}
{130}{}{这是正确的。他是个好人。}
#{131}{}{Fair guy - cause he tolerates a former felon walking around? It makes me think twice about him.}
{131}{}{公平的人-因为他容忍一个前重罪犯到处走动？这让我对他三思而后行。}
#{132}{}{It's sad that your life turned out so badly. I'm sorry for making you relive it again.}
{132}{}{你的生活如此糟糕，真让人难过。很抱歉让你重温一遍。}
#{133}{}{Well, I'm just a stranger passing by. Don't have an opinion either way. See ya, Stapleton.}
{133}{}{我只是个路过的陌生人。不管怎样都不要有意见。再见，斯台普顿。}
#{134}{}{I'm used to people provoking me like that. So, your attempts are no good here. It's pointless, and I think you should just go and take care of your own business.}
{134}{}{我习惯了别人那样挑衅我。所以，你的尝试在这里是不好的。这是毫无意义的，我认为你应该去处理你自己的事情。}
#{135}{}{Don't know what makes you say that but thanks for your kind words.}
{135}{}{我不知道你为什么这么说，但谢谢你的好话。}
#{136}{}{Sure. Later... Wanderer.}
{136}{}{当然。稍后...流浪者。}
#{137}{}{Bye.}
{137}{}{再见。}
#{150}{}{What is this noticeable tower over there?}
{150}{}{那边那座引人注目的塔是什么？}
#{151}{}{A water tower made by pre-war company "Rain Soft". There's a giant tank inside, where artesian water was gathered by submerged pump, to then be dispersed by pressure system to clients, using water pipeline.}
{151}{}{战前“雨柔”公司建造的水塔。里面有一个巨大的水箱，潜水泵将自流的水收集起来，然后通过压力系统通过水管将水分散给客户。}
#{152}{}{But now it's not used?}
{152}{}{但现在没用了？}
#{153}{}{No. All the water was depleted before the Great War. There are lots of people willing to run it, but so far no one succeeded.}
{153}{}{不，在大战前所有的水都耗尽了。有很多人愿意经营它，但到目前为止没有人成功。}
#{154}{}{What's stopping them?}
{154}{}{是什么阻止了他们？}
#{155}{}{The pump turbine, which pumps the water from the underground, requires a new cleaning filter. No one knows where to get it. So, this gigantic towers stands still and useless. But even if filter would be found, one would have to spend a lot of time to set everything up. Even more than that...}
{155}{}{抽水机从地下抽水，需要一个新的清洁过滤器。没人知道从哪里得到它。所以，这座巨大的塔楼静止不动，毫无用处。但即使找到过滤器，也要花很多时间来设置。更重要的是...}
#{156}{}{More than what?}
{156}{}{不止什么？}
#{157}{}{I'm afraid to imagine the storm rising in a city, about who has right to run the tower. Everyone needs clean water - ordinary people, Nuka-cola facility, various cunning businessmen... Every resident even.}
{157}{}{我不敢想象风暴在一个城市升起，关于谁有权管理这座塔。每个人都需要干净的水-普通人，努卡可乐设施，各种狡猾的商人...每一个居民。}
#{158}{}{A tough decision it'll be, for sure. So, where could I find the part?}
{158}{}{肯定是个艰难的决定。那么，我在哪里能找到那个角色呢？}
#{159}{}{[Shrugs] I know Las Vegas has a dam built on Colorado river. I don't know how it functions, but there are plenty of clean water for sure. Even then, if they had the filter, caravaneers would deliver it already.}
{159}{}{我知道拉斯维加斯在科罗拉多河上建了一座水坝。我不知道它是怎么工作的，但肯定有很多干净的水。即使在那时，如果他们有过滤器，商队已经提供了。}
#{160}{}{How's dog meat?}
{160}{}{狗肉怎么样？}
#{161}{}{Well... Better than tough gecko meat or stinky molerat's.}
{161}{}{好...比硬壁虎肉或臭鼹鼠肉好。}
#{162}{}{And their owners don't mind?}
{162}{}{他们的主人不介意吗？}
#{163}{}{They don't have owners. It's a stray meat.}
{163}{}{他们没有主人。这是一块流浪肉。}
#{164}{}{You sure?}
{164}{}{你确定？}
#{165}{}{A dog wouldn't run away from a good master. Also, they don't have dog-tags and collars. In Salt Lake, every domestic dog gets one, to prevent accidents. Once upon a time, there was a big trouble with homeless dogs in the city.}
{165}{}{狗不会从一个好主人身边逃跑。而且，他们没有狗标签和项圈。在盐湖城，每只家养的狗都有一只，以防发生意外。从前，城里有一个流浪狗的大麻烦。}
#{166}{}{How did it got resolved?}
{166}{}{怎么解决的？}
#{167}{}{The Sheriff arranged a raid on them. Big crowd gathered, and also there were no problems with ammo and traps supply. Dogs were used as food then. Everyone got a profit, and also cleaned the city.}
{167}{}{治安官安排了一次突袭。一大群人聚集在一起，而且弹药和陷阱供应也没有问题。那时狗被用作食物。每个人都赚了钱，还打扫了城市。}
#{168}{}{...And so, you're keeping the habit?}
{168}{}{……那么，你还保持这个习惯？}
#{169}{}{Alright, let's not continue on this.}
{169}{}{好吧，我们不要继续了。}
#{170}{}{Sheriff knows. He's glad I do. He even leaves some ammo for shooting.}
{170}{}{警长知道。他很高兴我这么做。他甚至留下了一些子弹用来射击。}
#{171}{}{Well, if Sheriff himself encouraged dog-eating, then the situation in city was really crappy. Bye.}
{171}{}{好吧，如果警长自己鼓励狗吃，那么城市的情况真的很糟糕。再见。}
#{172}{}{Okay, I believe.}
{172}{}{好吧，我相信。}
#{180}{}{All dogs in the area are dead.}
{180}{}{该地区所有的狗都死了。}
#{181}{}{What, really? Nicely done! Hm... Guess you had to spend some ammo, eh? Here, I've got some spare gunpowder. It's all I can pay with. Now I can sleep at night. Really glad you helped.}
{181}{}{什么，真的？干得好！嗯...我猜你得花点弹药，嗯？给，我有一些备用火药。这是我能付的全部。现在我可以晚上睡觉了。很高兴你帮忙。}
#{182}{}{Well, take care then.}
{182}{}{好吧，那就保重。}
#{183}{}{How do you live all alone in such a wild district?}
{183}{}{你怎么一个人住在这么荒凉的地方？}
#{184}{}{Living fine. No one crosses me, I don't cross anyone... Except for dog pack. They can be a pain in the ass. Especially at night, when they won't let me sleep. But I go along with them better than with the men...}
{184}{}{生活得很好。没有人欺负我，我不会欺负任何人...除了狗包。他们会让我很难受，尤其是在晚上，他们不让我睡觉。但我更愿意和他们在一起...}
#{185}{}{Dogs bother you? I can get rid of them.}
{185}{}{狗打扰你了？我可以摆脱他们。}
#{186}{}{You just need to open yourself to the world. Bye.}
{186}{}{你只需要向世界敞开心扉。再见。}
#{187}{}{That... That would be great. But I kinda have nothing to pay with.}
{187}{}{那个...那太好了。但我没钱付。}
#{188}{}{Can't pay? No problem. I can still help.}
{188}{}{付不起？没问题。我还是可以帮忙的。}
#{189}{}{Can't pay? Then I won't bother.}
{189}{}{付不起？那我就不麻烦了。}
#{190}{}{The whole place is dog cemetery!}
{190}{}{整个地方都是狗墓地！}
#{191}{}{You've found out that the local outcast is a dog eater.}
{191}{}{你已经发现当地的弃儿是个吃狗的人。}
#{192}{}{Ew! What's with that smell?}
{192}{}{电子战！那味道是怎么回事？}
#{193}{}{The house reeks with dog meat.}
{193}{}{房子里到处都是狗肉味。}
#{194}{}{And how should I get it?}
{194}{}{我该如何得到它？}
#{200}{}{You did work on a facility. Can you also handle the train computer systems?}
{200}{}{你在一个设施里工作过。你也能操作火车计算机系统吗？}
#{201}{}{[Looks back at the door, then he gets up, blocking the window with his back] Where did you get that? From the train depot?}
{201}{}{[回头看了看门，然后他站起来，用背挡住窗户]你从哪儿弄来的？从火车站来的？}
#{202}{}{Well... Yes.}
{202}{}{好...对。}
#{203}{}{Do you really care?}
{203}{}{你真的在乎吗？}
#{204}{}{If the Sheriff finds out, you'll get hell of a problems. Depot is a no-go zone, not even talking about bringing anything from there.}
{204}{}{如果警长发现了，你会有大麻烦的。仓库是一个禁区，甚至不说从那里带任何东西。}
#{205}{}{Why such prohibitions?}
{205}{}{为什么会有这样的禁令？}
#{206}{}{I don't care for prohibitions. I just need to repair this device.}
{206}{}{我不喜欢禁令。我只需要修理这个装置。}
#{207}{}{I myself don't know much. But a lot of people died there. Some of them turned into a plasma goo. But I didn't tell you that.}
{207}{}{我自己知道的不多。但是很多人死在那里。其中一些变成了血浆黏液。但我没告诉你。}
#{208}{}{So do you know how to fix the computer?}
{208}{}{你知道怎么修电脑吗？}
#{209}{}{You shouldn't take this too light-headed. You need to be careful, when you talk about the railway. Creepy stuff's going on there.}
{209}{}{你不应该太轻率。当你谈论铁路的时候，你需要小心。那里发生了令人毛骨悚然的事情。}
#{210}{}{Maybe I could fix that computer. But I won't help you. I don't need any more problems for myself in this tight city.}
{210}{}{也许我能修好那台电脑。但我不会帮你的。在这个紧张的城市里，我不需要为自己再添麻烦了。}
#{211}{}{Hm.}
{211}{}{嗯。}
#{212}{}{So you can help me to fix that on-board computer?}
{212}{}{你能帮我修那台车载电脑吗？}
#{213}{}{Maybe I could fix that computer. But I wouldn't want crossing the sheriff.}
{213}{}{也许我能修好那台电脑。但我不想越过警长。}
#{214}{}{Trust me, I know what I'm doing.}
{214}{}{相信我，我知道我在做什么。}
#{215}{}{Alright, I'll think about it.}
{215}{}{好吧，我会考虑的。}
#{216}{}{Yes? Hm... I can probably trust you. Okay, listen. Most likely, some not very important but still necessary to function part was taken out of the computer. The sheriff is not a fool to destroy old technologies. If you get the tools for me, I'll try to fix it.}
{216}{}{对？嗯...我可以相信你。好吧，听着。最有可能的是，一些不是很重要，但仍然是必要的功能部分是采取了电脑。警长不是一个破坏旧技术的傻瓜。如果你给我弄到工具，我会设法修理的。}
#{217}{}{ And... If you don't mind, a bottle of "Bloody Mary", okay?}
{217}{}{还有...如果你不介意的话，来一瓶“血腥玛丽”，好吗？}
#{218}{}{Here's a bottle from Jolly Joe.}
{218}{}{这是乔利送的瓶子。}
#{219}{}{Oh, what a delight! Thanks.}
{219}{}{哦，多高兴啊！谢谢。}
#{220}{}{An ordinary tool is enough, right? Here it is.}
{220}{}{一个普通的工具就够了，对吧？给你。}
#{221}{}{Here's a super tool kit. Take it if you need.}
{221}{}{这是一个超级工具箱。你需要的话就拿去吧。}
#{222}{}{You're welcome.}
{222}{}{不客气。}
#{223}{}{That's alright, thanks. Anything is better than scavenging in ruins.}
{223}{}{没关系，谢谢。任何事都比在废墟中拾荒好。}
#{224}{}{Now, can you fix the computer please?}
{224}{}{现在，你能修一下电脑吗？}
#{225}{}{If I promised, can't go back on my word. Give me the thing, I'll try.}
{225}{}{如果我答应了，就不能食言。把东西给我，我试试。}
#{226}{}{Here. Don't let me down!}
{226}{}{在这里。别让我失望！}
#{227}{}{I'll return with the computer.}
{227}{}{我会带着电脑回来的。}
#{228}{}{You find they way to fix the train.}
{228}{}{你想办法修好火车。}
#{229}{}{It wasn't an easy task, but device works now. Here, try. [Stares at you for some time silently] It's not just curiosity, right? Where are you heading, if it's not a secret?}
{229}{}{这不是一个容易的任务，但设备现在可以工作了。来，试试。[默默地盯着你看了一段时间]这不仅仅是好奇，对吧？如果不是秘密，你要去哪里？}
#{230}{}{I'm going far. A few days of travel to the north.}
{230}{}{我要走很远。去北方旅行几天。}
#{231}{}{The north? It's a dangerous path. Different nature there, much meanier. Strong winds, cold, the radiation, people don't live there for long. Though, traveling by a train, probably, won't be as dangerous.}
{231}{}{北方？这条路很危险。不同的性质，更卑鄙。强风，寒冷，辐射，人们在那里住的时间不长。不过，乘火车旅行，可能不会那么危险。}
#{232}{}{How do you know all this?}
{232}{}{你怎么知道这些？}
#{233}{}{I've rode from north. But in fact, it was a long time ago.}
{233}{}{我从北方骑马来的。但事实上，那是很久以前的事了。}
#{234}{}{Rode? On, like, a vehicle?}
{234}{}{骑？在车上？}
#{235}{}{Yes, a train. I was a kid. [Something from the memories made him stop in mid-sentence] Though, it's uninteresting stuff. And I don't remember much myself. 'Twas too long time ago. Maybe, everything had changed since then.}
{235}{}{是的，一列火车。我还是个孩子。[记忆中的一些东西让他在句中停了下来]不过，这是很无趣的东西。我自己也记不太清楚了太久以前了。也许，从那以后一切都变了。}
#{236}{}{Okay, so long.}
{236}{}{好的，再见。}
#{240}{}{You said your name is Stapleton and you came from the north. Where did you live - in the house or bunker?}
{240}{}{你说你叫斯台普顿，从北方来。你住在哪里？房子里还是地堡里？}
#{241}{}{I think it was a bunker. With metal walls. A lot of light and music... Also, red flowers... And a terrible siren.}
{241}{}{我想那是个掩体。有金属墙。很多灯光和音乐...还有，红花...还有可怕的警笛声。}
#{242}{}{Flowers? Probably flowers did grow there...}
{242}{}{花？可能那里确实长了花...}
#{243}{}{Probably?! [he brightens up] So you did find the bunker!?}
{243}{}{可能？！你找到地堡了！？}
#{244}{}{Not even a bunker, but a whole big vault. It was hell of a terrible trip, but I managed to survive.}
{244}{}{不是碉堡，而是一个很大的地下室。那是一次可怕的旅行，但我设法活了下来。}
#{245}{}{No, uh, no. Just recalled.}
{245}{}{不，呃，不。只是回忆。}
#{246}{}{It is no wonder that these places are well guarded. But what has become of this place now??}
{246}{}{难怪这些地方戒备森严。但是现在这个地方怎么样了？？}
#{247}{}{The population left the vault when you were a child. I have a diary of a certain Stapleton. Perhaps, it's your ancestor.}
{247}{}{当你还是个孩子的时候，所有的人都离开了保险库。我有一本斯台普顿的日记。也许，是你的祖先。}
#{248}{}{My god! So many years have passed! I'm starting to remember... Yes! I'm starting to remember! Leave these writings to me! It's very personal!}
{248}{}{天哪！这么多年过去了！我开始记得...对！我开始记得了！把这些东西留给我！这是非常私人的！}
#{249}{}{How do you pay for the finding?}
{249}{}{你怎么付这个发现的钱？}
#{250}{}{Take.}
{250}{}{拿着。}
#{251}{}{No! I need them too.}
{251}{}{不！我也需要他们。}
#{252}{}{But I don't have anything... Wait, I can make shotgun ammo or give the components. It's not much... Please, it's so important to me!}
{252}{}{但我什么都没有...等等，我可以做散弹枪或者给你零件。没什么...拜托，这对我很重要！}
#{253}{}{Alright, take it. I give up them for free.}
{253}{}{好吧，拿去吧。我免费放弃它们。}
#{254}{}{Good. Give me the components and we're even.}
{254}{}{很好。把零件给我，我们就扯平了。}
#{255}{}{Craft some ammo and I'll give you the diary.}
{255}{}{制造一些弹药，我就把日记给你。}
#{256}{}{It's my memories! That's why I hope you'll change your mind.}
{256}{}{这是我的记忆！所以我希望你改变主意。}
#{257}{}{I can't. So long.}
{257}{}{我不能。这么久。}
#{258}{}{No! Can't drop them!}
{258}{}{不！不能丢下他们！}
#{259}{}{Alright-alright, don't worry so much.}
{259}{}{好吧，别担心。}
#{260}{}{You uncover the secret of the origin of this poor fellow.}
{260}{}{你揭开了这个可怜人的来历。}
#{261}{}{Thank you! It's my memories, and I'll spend time scrutinizing these diaries.}
{261}{}{谢谢您！这是我的记忆，我会花时间仔细阅读这些日记。}
#{262}{}{You're welcome.}
{262}{}{不客气。}
#{1110}{}{[The man you see is of a strong build, with an ugly face, that is missing an eye] That's my home, and here I live. Are you sure you came to the right place?}
{1110}{}{[你看到的那个男人体格健壮，长着一张丑陋的脸，缺了一只眼睛]那是我的家，我住在这里。你确定你来对地方了吗？}
#{1132}{}{It's sad that your life turned out so badly. I'm sorry for making you relive it again.}
{1132}{}{你的生活如此糟糕，真让人难过。很抱歉让你重温一遍。}
#{1136}{}{Sure. Later... Wanderer.}
{1136}{}{当然。稍后...流浪者。}
#{1243}{}{Probably?! [he brightens up] So you did find the bunker!?}
{1243}{}{可能？！你找到地堡了！？}
