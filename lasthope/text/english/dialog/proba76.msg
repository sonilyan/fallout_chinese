{100}{}{Hey there, I'm Joe. I run this gas station. Haven't seen you before, new here?}
#
{101}{}{That sign in the front says you sell cars... um, pre-owned?}
#
{102}{}{It sure does, except there are no working cars left so I sell parts and other stuff instead.}
#
{103}{}{I'm looking for some stuff.}
{104}{}{Can you tell me something about this place.}
{105}{}{Nothing today, thanks.}
#answer to some stuff
{106}{}{Stuff? I got plenty of stuff. Wanna take a look at it?}
{107}{}{[Tools.]}
{108}{}{[Car parts.]}
#about the place
{109}{}{Well, this is an old gas station. It was built a long time ago... My grandpa built it as a matter of fact. It's
 one of the last gas stations of this kind around these here parts. Heh, and the bad part is... Those pumps are empty if
 you wanna know. Sometimes even months pass until someone stops by. Business was good while those caravans were
 still coming, I really don't know what happened to them. Even an old, rusty gas station like this costs me money...}
#
{110}{}{So, you're saying you have a money problem?}
{111}{}{You said caravans used to come here, from where?}
{112}{}{This sunlight is dangerous, you should be inside.}
#money problem
{113}{}{Well, yeah, I sure have. I have to pay for repairs, cleaning, supplies and I'm taking care of my little kid.}
#
{114}{}{That little kid is yours?}
{115}{}{You sure have a lot of problems, old man.}
#little kid
{116}{}{I've adopted him. His parents left him, few years ago. Actually, there was a rumor his parents were killed
 because of some debts. Nobody really knows what happened to them. They disappeared just like that. [Snaps his
 fingers.] Anyway, I'm trying to raise him as best as I can. Now he's helping me running this gas station. To me, he'll
 always be my little boy.}
#
{117}{}{That's a nice story. Say, I could give you some money for the kid.}
#
{118}{}{You would really do that? That's the best thing someone could do for us!}
#
{119}{}{[Give him $100.]}
{120}{}{[Give him $500.]}
{121}{}{[Give him $1000.]}
# $100
{122}{}{Thank you! Thank you, stranger. I don't know if I can ever thank you enough for this. Please be my
 guest and grab a cold drink, it's on the house. [He smiles.]}
{123}{}{Thanks, take care now.}
# $500
{124}{}{This is... very generous of you! It's gonna help us a lot. I'm gonna buy my kid some textbooks with it. Perhaps
 even some new clothes will be good as well. I don't know how to repay you... I got this ammo, I'm sure you can
 make better use of it.}
#
{125}{}{Thanks, see ya around.}
# $1000
{126}{}{Oh my... This is a lot of money! And it's all for me and my kid... You sure are a generous one, thank you so
 much! This money will help me a lot in achieving what I had planned for my little boy. Many thanks to you,
 please take these stimpaks as a sign of my gratitude.}
#
{127}{}{Thanks, I was glad to help you.}
# caravans came from
{128}{}{As far as I know they were usually coming from Miners Town. I heard that the mine isn't working anymore
 because the machines they were using became too old for their own good, and started consuming *lotsa* fuel.
 Those caravans came here precisely because of the fuel, but they haven't shown up in quite some time now.}
#
{129}{}{Thanks.}
#sunlight
{130}{}{Well, it's indeed hard to withstand, but I have to be here at all times in case someone shows up, someone like
 you. Otherwise, people just keep walking past this old junk.}
#
{131}{}{Sorry to hear that. I'll leave you to it.}
#
{132}{}{I hope this helped you out.}
{133}{}{It sure did. Bye.}
#
{134}{}{}
#
{135}{}{Sorry, don't have money at the moment.}
#
{136}{}{So, do you have some money?}
#
{137}{}{Do you have some old car tires?}
#car tires...
{138}{}{Yes, I have some in my storage, but it'll cost you.}
{139}{}{How much?}
{140}{}{Look, you just give me what I need and I'll let you live.}
#how much...
{141}{}{Let me see... $2000 is my price.}
{142}{}{Alright. [Give him the money.]}
{143}{}{That's a bit too much for me. I'll be back with the money.}
#all right...
{144}{}{You sure got a lot of money to spend. Here, take the key to the storage door. You can take what you need, but
 there isn't much left...}
{145}{}{Thanks.}
#
{146}{}{About those tires...}
#
{147}{}{You got the money?}
{148}{}{Yep, here you go. [Give him the money.]}
{149}{}{Nope, I'll be back with the money.}
