#{100}{}{You see a citizen of Reno.}
{100}{}{你看到一个里诺市民。}
#{101}{}{You see Harding.}
{101}{}{你看哈丁。}
#{102}{}{You see a resident of the slums. You'd want to say he's seen better days, but actually he looks like he's never seen a good day in his life.}
{102}{}{你看到一个贫民窟的居民。你可能想说他看到了更好的日子，但实际上他看起来一辈子都没见过好日子。}
#{103}{}{Thank you, I really do feel a lot better. Although these pills make me feel kinda limp.}
{103}{}{谢谢，我真的感觉好多了。虽然这些药片让我觉得有点无力。}
#{104}{}{Thank you for the support, friend. You're an example to live by.}
{104}{}{谢谢你的支持，朋友。你是一个值得信赖的榜样。}
#{110}{}{[You notice a few tears glistening on his cheeks.] Huh? Who are you?}
{110}{}{[你注意到他脸上有几滴眼泪在闪闪发光]嗯？你是谁？}
#{111}{}{My name is }
{111}{}{我的名字是}
#{112}{}{. What happened to you?}
{112}{}{. 你怎么了？}
#{113}{}{I'm a bandit. You'd better hand over all your cash, pronto!}
{113}{}{我是个强盗。你最好马上把钱都交出来！}
#{114}{}{Santa Claus. I'm outta here.}
{114}{}{圣诞老人。我要走了。}
#{115}{}{This seems like a bad time. I'll be back when you're feeling better.}
{115}{}{现在似乎不是时候。当你感觉好些的时候我会回来的。}
#{116}{}{Yeah? That's funny, 'cuz I don't have anything. Look! There's nothing here. Wright's men already took everything I had!}
{116}{}{是 啊？真有趣，因为我什么都没有。你看！这里什么都没有。莱特的人已经拿走了我所有的东西！}
#{117}{}{Relax, it was just a joke. By the way, I'm }
{117}{}{别紧张，那只是个玩笑。顺便说一下，我}
#{118}{}{Then sit tight. And not a peep. Got it?}
{118}{}{然后坐好。而不是偷看。知道了？}
#{119}{}{Shucks, I'm going then. You can relax.}
{119}{}{嘘，那我就去。你可以放松。}
#{120}{}{Sorry, it's just depression, nothing serious. I'm Harding, your local handyman. How can I help ya?}
{120}{}{抱歉，只是抑郁症，没什么大不了的。我是哈丁，你们当地的勤杂工。我能帮你什么？}
#{121}{}{Boo-hoo, would you look at those tears! Are you a man or a rag, Harding?!}
{121}{}{呜呜，你看看那些眼泪！你是男人还是破烂，哈丁？！}
#{122}{}{It sure looks serious, Harding. Can I do anything to help?}
{122}{}{看起来很严重，哈丁。我能帮忙吗？}
#{123}{}{So long, Harding.}
{123}{}{再见，哈丁。}
#{124}{}{Hello there. I've pretty much recovered now. How can I help ya?}
{124}{}{你好。我现在几乎康复了。我能帮你什么？}
#{125}{}{You're right - I'm nothing but a rag. My neighbors laugh at me and I'm forced to do everyone's dirty work because I'm a pushover. No, I won't make any excuses. That's how the world works. They're wolves and I'm a sheep. That's just how it is.}
{125}{}{你说得对-我不过是个破烂。我的邻居嘲笑我，我被迫做每个人的脏活，因为我是个容易受人欺负的人。不，我不会找任何借口的。世界就是这样运转的。他们是狼，我是羊。事情就是这样。}
#{126}{}{Help? How? With the depression? I seriously doubt it. I often get the feeling of utter insignificance. I'm nothing but a rag. My neighbors laugh at me and I'm forced to do everyone's dirty work because I'm a pushover. No, I won't make any excuses. That's how the world works. They're wolves and I'm a sheep. That's just how it is.}
{126}{}{救命啊？怎样？在大萧条时期？我真的很怀疑。我常常觉得自己微不足道。我只不过是个破烂。我的邻居嘲笑我，我被迫做每个人的脏活，因为我是个容易受人欺负的人。不，我不会找任何借口的。世界就是这样运转的。他们是狼，我是羊。事情就是这样。}
#{127}{}{Maybe your neighbors ought to be taught a lesson.}
{127}{}{也许你的邻居应该得到教训。}
#{128}{}{Well, I don't think I can help here. I'll be off.}
{128}{}{我想我帮不了你。我要走了。}
#{129}{}{God no! Not at all! They can't be helped, nor it's needed. Everything is as it should be. Society is putting me in my place, I suppose.}
{129}{}{上帝不！一点也不！他们无法得到帮助，也不需要帮助。一切都是应该的。我想是社会把我放在了我的位置上。}
#{130}{}{Why are you giving up so easily?}
{130}{}{你为什么这么容易放弃？}
#{131}{}{Well, I had to try. Bye, Harding, I'll see you later. Maybe.}
{131}{}{嗯，我得试试。再见，哈丁，回头见。也许 吧。}
#{132}{}{One good man is teaching me how to live among people. He says that I can survive if I submit. It's not always easy.}
{132}{}{一个好人教我如何与人相处。他说如果我屈服我就能活下来。这并不总是容易的。}
#{133}{}{Hmm. Alright, I'm going now.}
{133}{}{嗯。好吧，我现在就走。}
#{140}{}{What did your neighbors say about the anonymous club?}
{140}{}{你的邻居怎么说匿名俱乐部的？}
#{141}{}{They told you about that place, huh? You see? I didn't do anything to them and they're already pouring a ton of swill into my chipped pot.}
{141}{}{他们告诉过你那个地方，是吗？你看到了吗？我什么也没对他们做，他们已经把一吨泔水倒进我的破罐子里了。}
#{142}{}{Er, chipped pot?}
{142}{}{呃，有缺口的罐子？}
#{143}{}{Yeah. All of us who go to the club - we're humanity's chipped pots. Thrown out into the trash but we're still trying to stay alive. And people like to see that - after all, who doesn't enjoy a good show?}
{143}{}{是 啊。我们所有去俱乐部的人-我们是人类的破罐子。扔进垃圾桶，但我们仍在努力活着。而人们喜欢看到这一点――毕竟，谁不喜欢一场精彩的演出？}
#{144}{}{Tell me about this club.}
{144}{}{告诉我这个俱乐部的情况。}
#{145}{}{So who leads the club, anyway?}
{145}{}{那么到底是谁领导了俱乐部？}
#{146}{}{Who are the other "pots" in this club of yours?}
{146}{}{你们俱乐部的其他“花盆”是谁？}
#{147}{}{}
{147}{}{}
#{148}{}{}
{148}{}{}
#{149}{}{That's enough for now. I'll see you later.}
{149}{}{现在已经够了。回头见。}
#{150}{}{Nobody cares about it except for us. It's a small gathering of people who want to find the strength to live on. We get together and talk about our problems and such. You wouldn't be interested... }
{150}{}{除了我们没人关心它。这是一个小聚会的人谁想找到力量生活。我们聚在一起讨论我们的问题等等。你不会感兴趣的。。。}
#{151}{}{Patrick put it all together. He's a good man, preaches the word of God and always listens to those in need. But he just knows what needs to be done. Other than that, we have no leader.}
{151}{}{帕特里克把这一切都放在一起了。他是个好人，宣扬上帝的道，总是倾听那些需要帮助的人。但他知道需要做什么。除此之外，我们没有领袖。}
#{152}{}{I won't say anything about that. We can't talk behind each other's backs.}
{152}{}{我什么也不说。我们不能背着对方说话。}
#{160}{}{Listen, I talked to Patrick about your club... }
{160}{}{听着，我和帕特里克谈过你的俱乐部。。。}
#{161}{}{What?! How dare he?! He promised not to discuss anything behind our backs! And you... What did you talk about? He told you about us, didn't he? Did you laugh at us? Please, go away! I don't want to see any of you anymore!}
{161}{}{什么？！他怎么敢？！他答应不在我们背后讨论任何事情！和你。。。你说了什么？他告诉过你我们的事，不是吗？你嘲笑我们了吗？拜托，走开！我不想再见到你们了！}
#{162}{}{Please, go away! I don't want to see any of you anymore!}
{162}{}{拜托，走开！我不想再见到你们了！}
#{163}{}{No, no, calm down! I'm here to help you. We can trust each other, can't we?}
{163}{}{不，不，冷静！我是来帮你的。我们可以互相信任，不是吗？}
#{164}{}{Well fuck you too, you pathetic imbecile!}
{164}{}{去你妈的，你这个可怜的白痴！}
#{165}{}{Fine, I'm going.}
{165}{}{好吧，我去。}
#{166}{}{Is that so? Can I really be helped? Is there someone who can mend the crack in my pot?}
{166}{}{是这样吗？我真的能得到帮助吗？有人能修补我锅里的裂缝吗？}
#{167}{}{Perhaps nobody can, but you can't keep suffering. I have anti-smoker tablets that dampen emotions. You'll feel better, trust me.}
{167}{}{也许没人可以，但你不能继续受苦。我有抑制情绪的抗吸烟药片。相信我，你会感觉好些的。}
#{168}{}{Of course! Your problems stem from your feelings of inferiority. If we resolve that, you'll be able to fix your other problems.}
{168}{}{当然！你的问题源于你的自卑感。如果我们解决了这个问题，你就能解决你的其他问题。}
#{169}{}{Hmm, I'll need to think about it. I'll be back soon.}
{169}{}{嗯，我需要考虑一下。我很快就回来。}
#{170}{}{I don't know how to fix your inferiority complex. Especially since it's so richly deserved.}
{170}{}{我不知道如何修复你的自卑感。尤其是因为这是应得的。}
#{171}{}{Here's a ticket to Mom's nightclub. You should go there and relax.}
{171}{}{这是一张去妈妈夜总会的票。你应该去那里放松一下。}
#{172}{}{You can't keep suffering. I have anti-smoker tablets that dampen emotions. You'll feel better, trust me.}
{172}{}{你不能一直受苦。我有抑制情绪的抗吸烟药片。相信我，你会感觉好些的。}
#{173}{}{Maybe you're right. I'll try. If they can make me relax, then they'd do nicely with my next bout of depression.}
{173}{}{也许你是对的。我试试看。如果他们能让我放松，那么他们会很好地解决我的下一轮抑郁症。}
#{174}{}{Here, go out and enjoy your life, Harding.}
{174}{}{来，出去享受你的生活，哈丁。}
#{175}{}{I was afraid to go there my entire life, let alone see a naked body! And now I'm holding my ticket to happiness... It's a strange feeling. You know, once, I thought the flagellation that society subjects itself to is the only thing leading to madness. But, you're making me rethink that theory. I'll try and change myself. No, I *will* change myself. Yes! I'll do it! Thank you.}
{175}{}{我一辈子都不敢去那里，更别说看裸体了！现在我拿着通往幸福的车票。。。这是一种奇怪的感觉。你知道吗，有一次，我认为社会对自己的鞭笞是导致疯狂的唯一原因。但是，你让我重新思考这个理论。我会努力改变自己。不，我会改变我自己。对！我会的！非常感谢。}
#{176}{}{You found a solution for Harding's depression.}
{176}{}{你找到了治疗哈丁抑郁症的方法。}
#{1104}{}{Thank you for the support, friend. You're an example to live by.}
{1104}{}{谢谢你的支持，朋友。你是一个值得信赖的榜样。}
#{1128}{}{Well, I don't think I can help here. I'll be on my way.}
{1128}{}{我想我帮不了你。我马上就来。}
#{1160}{}{Listen, I talked to Patrick about your club... }
{1160}{}{听着，我和帕特里克谈过你的俱乐部。。。}
#{1161}{}{What?! How dare he?! He promised not to discuss anything behind our backs! And you... What did you talk about? He told you about us, didn't he? Did you laugh at us? Please, go away! I don't want to see any of you anymore!}
{1161}{}{什么？！他怎么敢？！他答应不在我们背后讨论任何事情！和你。。。你说了什么？他告诉过你我们的事，不是吗？你嘲笑我们了吗？拜托，走开！我不想再见到你们了！}
