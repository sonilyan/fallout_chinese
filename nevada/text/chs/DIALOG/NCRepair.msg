#{100}{}{You see Frank Cochran.}
{100}{}{你看弗兰克・科克伦。}
#{101}{}{You see frowned working man in clothes stained with engine oil and soot.}
{101}{}{你看到皱眉的工人穿着沾满机油和煤烟的衣服。}
#{108}{}{I have another question.}
{108}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{109}{}{Thanks.}
{109}{}{谢谢。}
#{110}{}{Yeah, what?}
{110}{}{是啊，什么？}
#{111}{}{I have more questions.}
{111}{}{我还有更多的问题。}
#{112}{}{Can you upgrade my armor?}
{112}{}{你能升级我的盔甲吗？}
#{113}{}{Can you modify weapons?}
{113}{}{你能改装武器吗？}
#{114}{}{Nothing.}
{114}{}{没有什么。}
#{115}{}{Alright, forget it.}
{115}{}{好吧，算了吧。}
#{120}{}{[Entering dim-lit room, you see its dirty-face goggles-wearing inhabitant. He looks pretty busy and tired at the same time. He stops working when notices you] Hnh? You a customer or just lost? You never know who's wandering all the way out here... But hey, maybe I'm lucky this time. What can I do for ya?}
{120}{}{[进入光线昏暗的房间，你会看到里面的居民戴着脏兮兮的护目镜。他看起来既忙又累。当他注意到你时就停止工作了]嗯？你是顾客还是刚刚迷路？你永远不知道是谁在这里游荡...但是嘿，也许这次我很幸运。我能为你做些什么？}
#{121}{}{Hi. May I wonder to whom I managed to came across in this slums?}
{121}{}{你好。我想知道我在这个贫民窟遇到了谁吗？}
#{122}{}{Frank Cochran, at your service. I'm mechanic and electrician, and also a little bit of a gunsmith. I often have to deal with just about anything that has something to do with repairing. As for slums - no offense taken, I like it that way. If I had more trust in people, I would've already moved somewhere closer to the central streets.}
{122}{}{弗兰克・科克伦，为您效劳。我是一名机械师和电工，同时也是一名小枪手。我经常要处理与修理有关的任何事情。至于贫民窟，我不介意，我喜欢这样。如果我对人们有更多的信任，我早就搬到离中心大街更近的地方去了。}
#{123}{}{I see. So if I need something repaired, I can talk to you?}
{123}{}{我懂了。如果我需要修理东西，我可以和你谈谈？}
#{124}{}{Yup, I'm always ready to do my favorite job, as long as you pay. What do you want, anyway?}
{124}{}{是的，我随时准备做我最喜欢的工作，只要你付钱。你到底想要什么？}
#{125}{}{How about some trade?}
{125}{}{交易怎么样？}
#{126}{}{This ain't a store, if that's what you mean. But I guess it can't hurt to offload some of this crap.}
{126}{}{这不是商店，如果你是这个意思的话。但我想卸下这些垃圾也没什么坏处。}
#{127}{}{Let??s take a look at your junk.}
{127}{}{让我们看看你的破烂。}
#{129}{}{Do you know where can I find pre-war vault technology around here?}
{129}{}{你知道在这附近哪里可以找到战前的保险库技术吗？}
#{130}{}{I'm not saying I'm glad to see you, but still, I have someone to talk to.}
{130}{}{我不是说我很高兴见到你，但我还是有人要和你谈谈。}
#{131}{}{Isn't it dangerous, living alone out here?}
{131}{}{一个人住在这里不危险吗？}
#{132}{}{Of course not. Central streets are more dangerous. In Reno, the less time you spend with others, the safer you'll be. Also, sometimes other people, who don't appreciate crowds, come to live out here too. There was another guy, Ted, just a little while ago. Kept to himself, didn't talk much - my kind of guy. Hasn't been around in a while, though. Don't know why.}
{132}{}{当然不是。中央街道更危险。在里诺，你和别人在一起的时间越少，你就越安全。还有，有时候其他人，不喜欢人群，也会来这里住。刚才还有一个人，特德。闭嘴，不怎么说话-我喜欢的那种人。不过，好久没出现了。不知道为什么。}
#{133}{}{Ted, huh? I'll have to remember that.}
{133}{}{泰德，嗯？我必须记住这一点。}
#{134}{}{You have some weird neighbors in the basement, you know that?}
{134}{}{你在地下室有一些奇怪的邻居，你知道吗？}
#{135}{}{Yeah, they showed up recently. Know nothing about them, and don't really want to. They are sitting there quietly, not bothering me, and I'm pretty much ok with that. I have a feeling that they are guarding something in there.}
{135}{}{是的，他们最近出现了。对他们一无所知，也不想知道。他们安静地坐在那里，不打扰我，我对此很满意。我有一种感觉，他们在那里守卫着什么东西。}
#{136}{}{I see.}
{136}{}{我懂了。}
#{140}{}{I have to open an, uh, abandoned safe. Can you help me?}
{140}{}{我得打开一个，呃，废弃的保险箱。你能帮助我吗？}
#{141}{}{Don't know nothing about safecracking. Plenty of thieves in Reno if you want to ask about that. But - I've got some military-grade thermite. Not much, though. Also, it ain't cheap, so get the money ready, if you want it.}
{141}{}{对安全破解一无所知。如果你想问的话，雷诺有很多小偷。但是-我有军用铝热剂。不过，不多。而且，它不便宜，所以准备好钱，如果你想要的话。}
#{142}{}{Tell me about this termite.}
{142}{}{告诉我这个白蚁。}
#{143}{}{Let's trade, then.}
{143}{}{那我们交易吧。}
#{144}{}{I don't think I need that.}
{144}{}{我想我不需要那个。}
#{145}{}{Got it from some prospectors coming back from an army base. They thought it was an explosive. So, I ran some tests. Turned out, this stuff consists of some mixture of different oxydes, peroxydes, and some chemicals I couldn't understand. Looks like usual thermite, but there's a catch: it produces no flames, but a fuckton of heat. It'll burn through pretty much anything, including metal, and it does it silently. Perfect for getting into an "abandoned" safe.}
{145}{}{从一个军事基地回来的探矿者那里得到的。他们以为是炸药。所以，我做了一些测试。原来，这些东西是由不同的氧化物，过氧物和一些我不懂的化学物质的混合物组成的。看起来像普通的铝热剂，但有一个陷阱：它不产生火焰，但他妈的热。它几乎可以烧穿任何东西，包括金属，而且是无声的。非常适合进入“废弃”的保险箱。}
#{146}{}{Do you only have the one package?}
{146}{}{你只有一个包裹吗？}
#{147}{}{[He squints at you for a second, then shrugs] Actually, I've got another. I was keeping it for a rainy day, but eh, what the hell. I know you mean business, so I'll sell it to you.}
{147}{}{[他眯了你一眼，然后耸耸肩]事实上，我还有一个。我想留着它以备不时之需，但是，呃，见鬼。我知道你是认真的，所以我把它卖给你。}
#{148}{}{Yup, that's it. I didn't make it myself, you know. Once it's gone, it's gone.}
{148}{}{是的，就是这样。不是我自己做的，你知道的。一旦它消失了，它就消失了。}
#{149}{}{Like the pre-war bomb shelters? We've got two in Reno. One under the town hall, which Thompson's using as his headquarters, and one under the city park, near the old bowling alley. Stryker's got it locked up, though.}
{149}{}{像战前的防空洞？里诺有两个。一个在市政厅下面，汤普森用它作为他的总部，另一个在城市公园下面，靠近旧保龄球馆。史崔克把它锁起来了。}
#{150}{}{Can you make ammunition?}
{150}{}{你会制造弹药吗？}
#{151}{}{Nah, I don't do that. It's not hard though, but you'd need an ammo press.}
{151}{}{不，我不这么做。虽然不难，但你需要一个弹药压力机。}
#{152}{}{Then, can you make me an ammo press? I'll pay.}
{152}{}{那么，你能给我做个弹药压力机吗？我会付钱的。}
#{153}{}{Never mind, then.}
{153}{}{那没关系。}
#{154}{}{Hmm... Yeah, I can do that. I'll need 10,000 bucks and several days to work on it.}
{154}{}{Hmm...是的，我能做到。我需要1万美元和几天的时间。}
#{155}{}{That's a fair price. I'll give you 5000 dollars up front, and the rest when the tool is done.}
{155}{}{这是一个公平的价格。我先付你5000美元，剩下的等工具完成后再付。}
#{156}{}{See you later.}
{156}{}{再见。}
#{157}{}{Wow, that's expensive! Can't we negotiate?}
{157}{}{哇，太贵了！我们不能谈判吗？}
#{158}{}{I wouldn't have to charge so much if I had decent tools. Mine are all worn out, it's a pain in the ass to work with these. Get me something like "Snap-Off" super tool kit, and I'll get it done in less time and only charge you 2000 bucks. Deal?}
{158}{}{如果我有像样的工具，我就不用收那么多钱了。我的都累坏了，和这些一起工作真让人讨厌。给我一些像“啪啪”的超级工具箱，我会在更短的时间内完成，只收你2000美元。处理？}
#{159}{}{I just happen to have one right here! So, deal?}
{159}{}{我正好有一个！那么，成交？}
#{160}{}{You trying to fucking cheat me? I'm not blind, you know?}
{160}{}{你他妈的想骗我？我不是瞎子，你知道吗？}
#{161}{}{Not enough? Let me come back later.}
{161}{}{还不够？我晚点再来。}
#{162}{}{You're the boss. Come back in a few days for the press.}
{162}{}{你是老板。过几天再来找媒体。}
#{163}{}{I'll see you then.}
{163}{}{到时候见。}
#{170}{}{How's my ammo press coming along?}
{170}{}{我的弹药压得怎么样了？}
#{171}{}{It's done. I've got it hidden away, just in case. Give me the money first, then I'll get it for you.}
{171}{}{完成了。我把它藏起来了，以防万一。先把钱给我，然后我给你拿。}
#{172}{}{Here it is, 5000 bucks.}
{172}{}{给你，5000块。}
#{173}{}{It'll be easier to kill you and find it myself! [Attack]}
{173}{}{杀了你自己去找会更容易！[攻击]}
#{174}{}{Wait here, I'll be back with the money.}
{174}{}{在这儿等着，我会带着钱回来的。}
#{175}{}{I don't have the cash on me, but maybe you'll be interested in this super tool kit?}
{175}{}{我身上没带现金，但也许你会对这个超级工具箱感兴趣？}
#{180}{}{I can't make some calibers with this ammo press.}
{180}{}{我用这个弹药压力机做不出口径。}
#{181}{}{Yeah, you can't have it all with just one of those. But now that I think about it, I can improve it for you.}
{181}{}{是啊，你不可能只靠一个就拥有一切。但现在我想了想，我可以帮你改进一下。}
#{182}{}{Improve it? How?}
{182}{}{改进它？怎么用？}
#{183}{}{Forget it, it's fine as it is.}
{183}{}{算了吧，现在还不错。}
#{184}{}{I can add more attachments and bits. You'll be able to make more calibers and even press armor-piercing rounds. It'll be heavier, but it'll be worth it. Let's say...}
{184}{}{我可以添加更多的附件和位。你可以制造更多的口径，甚至可以压制穿甲弹。它会更重，但值得。比如说...}
#{185}{}{ bucks.}
{185}{}{美元。}
#{186}{}{Here's the money. Get started.}
{186}{}{这是钱。开始吧。}
#{187}{}{Done! Always good to see a masterpiece come together.}
{187}{}{完成！总是很高兴看到一个杰作走到一起。}
#{188}{}{Thanks!}
{188}{}{谢谢！}
#{190}{}{Can you fix this on-board computer?}
{190}{}{你能修好这台车载电脑吗？}
#{191}{}{[He takes the computer, looking as he had never seen anything like this before, spins it in his hands for a little, meditatively draws his finger over dusty circuit board, sniffs the smell of condensers, and then scratches back of his head] Yeah, I can do that. Why not? It looks like some parts are missing. Not a big problem though. I could look into it, for a buck. 2000 will do just fine.}
{191}{}{[他拿着电脑，看起来他以前从未见过这样的东西，在手里转了一会儿，沉思地把手指放在布满灰尘的电路板上，嗅了嗅冷凝器的气味，然后挠了挠后脑勺]是的，我能做到。为什么不？看起来有些零件不见了。不过问题不大。我可以调查一下，只要一块钱。2000年就可以了。}
#{192}{}{Here's the money, but be careful. It can't be replaced and I *really* need it to work. No second chances.}
{192}{}{这是钱，但要小心。它是不可替代的，我真的需要它来工作。没有第二次机会。}
#{193}{}{I'll think about it.}
{193}{}{我会考虑的。}
#{194}{}{You found a way to repair the train in Salt Lake City.}
{194}{}{你在盐湖城找到了修车的方法。}
#{195}{}{I, uh, broke my favorite pool cue. Can it be repaired?}
{195}{}{一、 呃，打破了我最喜欢的台球球杆。能修好吗？}
#{196}{}{Yeah, no problem. To just assemble it is pretty easy. You have to make a metallic joint and cut the cue into shape. The tricky part is in the balance. You need to take into account the right weight, length and curve. Lucky for you, I used to be pretty good at pool, even played with Mr. Chase once or twice, and he's a real master of the game. I hope my skills still ain't that rusty. I'll fix it for 200 bucks.}
{196}{}{是的，没问题。组装起来很容易。你必须做一个金属接头，把球杆切成形状。棘手的是平衡。你需要考虑到正确的重量，长度和曲线。你真幸运，我以前打台球很在行，甚至和蔡斯先生打过一两次球，他是个真正的高手。我希望我的技术还没那么生疏。我花200块把它修好。}
#{197}{}{It's a deal. Here's the money and the cue.}
{197}{}{就这么定了。这是钱和线索。}
#{198}{}{Well, if it's more important to be a good player than a mechanic, then I'll try to fix it myself. Goodbye.}
{198}{}{好吧，如果一个好球员比一个技工更重要的话，那我就自己去修。再见。}
#{199}{}{It's done! You won't even know the difference.}
{199}{}{完成了！你甚至不知道区别。}
#{200}{}{I need metal plates the size and shape of coins.}
{200}{}{我需要硬币大小和形状的金属板。}
#{201}{}{Easy. How many?}
{201}{}{容易的。多少？}
#{202}{}{500}
{202}{}{500}
#{203}{}{400}
{203}{}{400}

#{207}{}{Actually, never mind.}
{207}{}{其实，没关系。}
#{208}{}{Sure. I'll do it for }
{208}{}{当然。我会为你做的}
#{209}{}{Here??s the money.}
{209}{}{这是钱。}
#{210}{}{No thanks.}
{210}{}{不用了，谢谢。}
#{211}{}{[An hour later, exhausted mechanic drags in a sack full of plates] Uh... We have a little problem. I busted my last drill working on these, so don't know how to continue. All I managed to make is here.}
{211}{}{[一小时后，筋疲力尽的机械师拖着装满盘子的袋子]呃...我们有个小问题。我上一次训练的时候把它们弄坏了，所以不知道怎么继续。我所能做的就是在这里。}
#{212}{}{Well, at least it's something.}
{212}{}{好吧，至少有点道理。}
#{213}{}{ bucks.}
{213}{}{美元。}
#{220}{}{Can you fix the Cheyenne's water tank in Lovelock?}
{220}{}{你能在洛夫洛克修好夏安人的水箱吗？}
#{221}{}{Fuck me sideways! Are you serious? You'll have to try very, very hard to motivate me. I'm a great mechanic after all, I've fixed half this city. I don't need to bust my ass hiking up the mountain to patch up some dirty rainwater collector for a bunch of savages.}
{221}{}{去他妈的！你是认真的吗？你得非常非常努力地激励我。我是一个伟大的机械师，毕竟我修了半个城市。我不需要为了给一群野人修补脏兮兮的雨水收集器而去爬山。}
#{222}{}{ bucks.}
{222}{}{美元。}
#{223}{}{Jeez, I was just asking. Never mind.}
{223}{}{天哪，我只是问问。不要介意。}
#{226}{}{Would }
{226}{}{会吗}
#{227}{}{dollars be worth your time?}
{227}{}{美元值得你花时间吗？}
#{228}{}{[He scratches one unshaven cheek] Yeah... Alright, fine. But I want the cash up front.}
{228}{}{[他刮了刮胡子的脸颊]是的...好吧，很好。但我要先付现金。}
#{229}{}{Here, take it. Don't try anything funny!}
{229}{}{来，拿着。别耍花样！}
#{230}{}{Actually, I changed my mind. You can go back to doing nothing.}
{230}{}{实际上，我改变主意了。你可以回去无所事事。}
#{231}{}{[Carefully counts the money, then nods] Yeah, yeah. I'll get it done. No worries.}
{231}{}{[仔细数钱，然后点头]是的，是的。我会搞定的。别担心。}
#{232}{}{Good.}
{232}{}{很好。}
#{233}{}{I don't work for free.}
{233}{}{我不是免费工作的。}
#{234}{}{You're busting my balls here!}
{234}{}{你把我搞砸了！}
#{235}{}{Keep dreaming.}
{235}{}{继续做梦。}
#{240}{}{I need a fuse for a water pump.}
{240}{}{我需要一个水泵的保险丝。}
#{241}{}{Easy. Got one tucked away in my stash. [he squints] It's yours for 300 bucks.}
{241}{}{容易的。我藏了一个。[他眯着眼睛]这是你的300美元。}
#{242}{}{Are you out of your mind?! So much money for such a little thing?}
{242}{}{你疯了吗？！这么小的东西花了这么多钱？}
#{243}{}{Here??s the money. Give me the fuse.}
{243}{}{这是钱。把保险丝给我。}
#{244}{}{I'll keep looking.}
{244}{}{我会继续找的。}
#{245}{}{[He shrugs] Nothing is free nowadays. But I've got an alternative option, if you are interested.}
{245}{}{[他耸耸肩]现在没有什么是免费的。但如果你有兴趣的话，我有另一个选择。}
#{246}{}{I??m listening.}
{246}{}{我在听。}
#{247}{}{No, I'll pay. Here's the money.}
{247}{}{不，我来付。这是钱。}
#{248}{}{Got a lot of dogs around here lately. Think it's breeding season, they're horny and ornery. Looks like mutts from all of Reno gather here to a party, so I'm afraid even to go out to take a piss at night. You kill the bitches, and the fuse is yours.}
{248}{}{最近这里有很多狗。以为现在是繁殖季节，它们又角质又好斗。看起来里诺所有的狗都聚集在这里参加派对，所以我晚上都不敢出去撒尿。你杀了那些婊子，导火索就是你的了。}
#{249}{}{It's a deal.}
{249}{}{就这么定了。}
#{250}{}{Good.}
{250}{}{很好。}
#{251}{}{Thanks for the fuse.}
{251}{}{谢谢你的保险丝。}
#{252}{}{About that fuse...}
{252}{}{关于保险丝...}
#{253}{}{Three hundred bucks. And don't bother trying to rob me, it's hidden away where you'll never find it.}
{253}{}{三百美元。别费心抢我，它藏在你永远找不到的地方。}
#{254}{}{That's pretty expensive. Is there anything I can do to lower the price?}
{254}{}{那相当贵。我能做些什么来降低价格吗？}
#{255}{}{I killed the female dogs. Where's my reward?}
{255}{}{我杀了母狗。我的报酬呢？}
#{256}{}{I'll pay. Here??s the money.}
{256}{}{我会付钱的。这是钱。}
#{257}{}{Was worth it. Thanks for the help.}
{257}{}{这是值得的。谢谢你的帮助。}
#{258}{}{You??re welcome.}
{258}{}{不客气。}
#{259}{}{Great.}
{259}{}{伟大的。}
#{260}{}{Well, I'm just gonna go, then.}
{260}{}{好吧，那我就走。}
#{261}{}{How about I spend one bullet instead?}
{261}{}{不如我用一颗子弹代替？}
#{262}{}{Ha! I don't fucking think so. You'll never find my stash without me.}
{262}{}{哈！我他妈的不这么认为。没有我你永远找不到我的藏身之所。}
#{263}{}{Hmm...}
{263}{}{Hmm...}
#{270}{}{Have you ever worked on a functional car?}
{270}{}{你曾经做过功能车吗？}
#{271}{}{Like every mechanic, I worked on cars. And by that I mean disassembled a lot of them understanding nothing about how they work. Also, It's almost impossible to find parts that are in working condition.}
{271}{}{像所有的机械师一样，我在汽车上工作。我的意思是分解了很多，对它们的工作原理一无所知。而且，几乎不可能找到处于工作状态的零件。}
#{272}{}{Do you have any of that parts?}
{272}{}{你有这些零件吗？}
#{273}{}{That's all I wanted to know.}
{273}{}{我只想知道这些。}
#{274}{}{Yeah, I got one good thing - a fuel regulator. If you had a working car, I could try to install it. It's supposed to lower battery consumption, as I recall.}
{274}{}{是的，我有件好事-一个燃料调节器。如果你有一辆能用的车，我可以试着安装它。我记得，它应该可以降低电池消耗。}
#{275}{}{Good idea. Because I just so happened to have a working car.}
{275}{}{好主意。因为我正好有一辆能用的车。}
#{276}{}{[His eyes go wide] Really?! You got a working car? Can I see it?}
{276}{}{真的吗？！你的车能用吗？我能看看吗？}
#{277}{}{It's right outside. So, about that part...}
{277}{}{就在外面。所以，关于那部分...}
#{278}{}{It's not here. Maybe I'll drive it by later.}
{278}{}{它不在这里。也许我晚点开车过去。}
#{279}{}{Sure! What else am I gonna use this thing for? I'll install it for, let's say...1000 bucks.}
{279}{}{当然！我还能用这个做什么？我会安装它，比方说…1000美元。}
#{280}{}{Here's the money. Get to work.}
{280}{}{这是钱。开始工作吧。}
#{281}{}{Not right now.}
{281}{}{现在不行。}
#{282}{}{I think I'll kill you and install the part myself!}
{282}{}{我想我会杀了你，自己安装这个部件！}
#{283}{}{Fuel regulator. Install it in a car engine and it'll double your battery life. I'll sell and install it for 1000 bucks.}
{283}{}{燃油调节器。把它装在汽车引擎里，电池寿命就会加倍。我将以1000美元的价格出售并安装它。}
#{284}{}{What was that thing you said about a car part?}
{284}{}{你说的汽车零件是什么？}
#{285}{}{[He smirks] Nah, you are joking. I don't think you will. And you not only won't find it without me, but also could never figure out how to install it properly. *I'm* the mechanic here, if you didn't understand it by now.}
{285}{}{不，你在开玩笑。我想你不会的。如果没有我，你不仅找不到它，而且永远也找不出如何正确安装它。*我是这里的机械师，如果你现在还不明白的话。}
#{286}{}{I'm dead serious. And guess what, here I go! [Attack]}
{286}{}{我是认真的。你猜怎么着，我来了！[攻击]}
#{287}{}{Hmm. I see. Fine, here's the money. I'll wait for you to finish.}
{287}{}{嗯。我明白了。好吧，这是钱。我等你说完。}
#{288}{}{Hmm. I see. I'll go get the money, then.}
{288}{}{嗯。我明白了。那我去拿钱。}
#{289}{}{Now your car's fuel consumption will be much more effective than before!}
{289}{}{现在你的车的油耗会比以前有效得多！}
#{290}{}{What can you tell me about this part?}
{290}{}{关于这部分你能告诉我什么？}
#{291}{}{Hmm...that's a fuel controller. Used in car engines. Irreplaceable, car just won't start without it. Y'know, a caravan merchant from Wind of War was asking about this part a while ago. You might be able to do something with it there.}
{291}{}{嗯…那是个燃料控制器。用于汽车发动机。不可替代的，没有它汽车就发动不起来。你知道吗，一个来自《战争之风》的商队商人不久前问过这个问题。你也许可以在那里做点什么。}
#{292}{}{Wind of War? I should remember that.}
{292}{}{战争之风？我应该记得。}
#{300}{}{[He scratches his unshaven cheek] Eh. I'm not good with just any weapon, but when it comes to standard stuff - pistols, rifles, shotguns - it's all pretty straightforward to me. Don't expect much though.}
