#{100}{}{You see a runty Hunter.}
{100}{}{你看到一个矮胖的猎人。}
#{150}{}{You see Kraig.}
{150}{}{你看到克莱格了。}
#{200}{}{You see a short-statured Mutant Hunter with a tall forehead.}
{200}{}{你看到一个身材矮小，额头高的变种猎人。}
#{250}{}{You see Kraig, a Mutant Hunter of short stature.}
{250}{}{你看克莱格，一个身材矮小的变种猎人。}
#{300}{}{You don't look well at all. Put yourself together and then come back. I don't have time for you anyway, I have about a million things I need to take care of.}
{300}{}{你看起来一点也不好。振作起来然后回来。反正我没时间陪你，我有一百万件事要处理。}
#{400}{}{Guards!}
{400}{}{警卫！}
#{401}{}{Like I didn't have enough to worry about.}
{401}{}{好像我没什么好担心的。}
#{402}{}{Somebody kill him already!}
{402}{}{有人已经杀了他！}
#{403}{}{Give up already!}
{403}{}{已经放弃了！}
#{404}{}{Knock it off.}
{404}{}{别说了。}
#{405}{}{This can't be happening.}
{405}{}{这不可能发生。}
#{406}{}{Somebody kill her already!}
{406}{}{有人已经杀了她！}
#{407}{}{Dammit, won't anyone help me?}
{407}{}{该死，谁都帮不了我吗？}
#{500}{}{I'll make it brief before you ask any stupid questions. I'm Kraig, and since you're not a Mutant Hunter, I'm probably the one you came here to see. Do you want to join the Hunters?}
{500}{}{在你问任何愚蠢的问题之前，我先简短地说。我是克雷格，既然你不是变种猎手，我可能就是你来这里找我的人。你想加入猎人吗？}
#{501}{}{Yes, that's why I'm here.}
{501}{}{是的，这就是我来这里的原因。}
#{502}{}{No.}
{502}{}{不。}
#{505}{}{Hu?}
{505}{}{胡？}
#{550}{}{Why are you here then?}
{550}{}{那你为什么在这里？}
#{551}{}{I wanted to report a mutant I found in the city.}
{551}{}{我想报告我在城里发现的一个变种人。}
#{552}{}{I had some questions.}
{552}{}{我有一些问题。}
#{553}{}{Nothing.}
{553}{}{没有什么。}
#{600}{}{Eh... What? Really? Well, that's good. In that case, you should go see commander Herman, his room is right next door.}
{600}{}{呃。。。什么？真正地？好吧，那很好。那样的话，你应该去见赫尔曼指挥官，他的房间就在隔壁。}
#{601}{}{OK.}
{601}{}{好 啊。}
#{650}{}{No way. I don't have time to answer nosey questions for everyone who comes here. Try to find someone with nothing to do. I'm sure it won't be too hard.}
{650}{}{不可能。我没时间回答所有来这里的人的问题。试着找一个无所事事的人。我相信这不会太难。}
#{651}{}{OK.}
{651}{}{好 啊。}
#{652}{}{You'll answer my questions or I'll kill you!}
{652}{}{你回答我的问题，否则我就杀了你！}
#{700}{}{Of course, why else would you be here. OK, first you must get examined by doctor Yaotzin to see if you're a genetically pure human. If everything's alright, come back to me.}
{700}{}{当然，不然你为什么会在这里。好的，首先你必须接受姚津医生的检查，看看你是不是一个基因纯正的人。如果一切都好，回到我身边。}
#{701}{}{Alright.}
{701}{}{好吧。}
#{702}{}{What the hell?! I want to join the Hunters and you're sending me to some doctor?}
{702}{}{我勒个去？！我想加入猎人的行列而你却要送我去看医生？}
#{750}{}{Geez, calm down. We just need to be sure that you're not a mutant, there's nothing to worry about. I mean, you're not a mutant, right? The doctor will also fix you up for free if you have other problems. Sounds alright?}
{750}{}{天哪，冷静点。我们只需要确定你不是变种人，没什么好担心的。我是说，你不是变种人，对吧？如果你有其他问题，医生也会免费为你治疗。听起来还好吧？}
#{751}{}{Alright.}
{751}{}{好吧。}
#{752}{}{Actually, I'm a mutant.}
{752}{}{实际上，我是个变种人。}
#{800}{}{You've been here already, right?}
{800}{}{你已经来过这里了，对吧？}
#{801}{}{I'm here to join the Hunters.}
{801}{}{我是来加入猎人的。}
#{802}{}{I wanted to report a mutant I found in the city.}
{802}{}{我想报告我在城里发现的一个变种人。}
#{803}{}{I had some questions.}
{803}{}{我有一些问题。}
#{804}{}{Yeah, and it was enough for me.}
{804}{}{是的，对我来说已经足够了。}
#{805}{}{Hu?}
{805}{}{胡？}
#{806}{}{Uff.}
{806}{}{不明飞行物。}
#{850}{}{You've been here already, right?}
{850}{}{你已经来过这里了，对吧？}
#{851}{}{I'm here to join the Hunters.}
{851}{}{我是来加入猎人的。}
#{852}{}{I wanted to report a mutant I found in the city.}
{852}{}{我想报告我在城里发现的一个变种人。}
#{853}{}{I had some questions.}
{853}{}{我有一些问题。}
#{854}{}{Yeah, and it was enough for me.}
{854}{}{是的，对我来说已经足够了。}
#{855}{}{Uff.}
{855}{}{不明飞行物。}
#{900}{}{You need to get examined by a doctor. Until you do, you're just wasting my time.}
{900}{}{你得去看医生。在你这么做之前，你只是在浪费我的时间。}
#{901}{}{I can't find him.}
{901}{}{我找不到他。}
#{902}{}{I wanted to report a mutant I found in the city.}
{902}{}{我想报告我在城里发现的一个变种人。}
#{903}{}{I had some questions.}
{903}{}{我有一些问题。}
#{904}{}{I'll go see him.}
{904}{}{我去见他。}
#{905}{}{Uff.}
{905}{}{不明飞行物。}
#{950}{}{Sucks to be you. Let's just say that being able to find the infirmary is required to join the Hunters.}
{950}{}{做你真糟糕。让我们说，能够找到医务室是必须加入猎人。}
#{951}{}{Great.}
{951}{}{伟大的。}
#{952}{}{Cut the bullshit and tell me where the hell he is!}
{952}{}{别说废话了，告诉我他到底在哪！}
#{1000}{}{Alright alright, no need to get so worked up. Go to the end of the corridor opposite the elevator, it's the door on the right.}
{1000}{}{好吧，好吧，没必要这么激动。走到电梯对面走廊的尽头，就在右边的门。}
#{1001}{}{See, that didn't hurt at all.}
{1001}{}{看，一点都不疼。}
#{1050}{}{It's you. Alright, I got the report from the doctor saying that you're fine.}
{1050}{}{是你。好吧，我收到医生的报告说你很好。}
#{1051}{}{What's next?}
{1051}{}{下一步是什么？}
#{1100}{}{You're a Hunter now! Ha, gotcha. Just kidding, it's not actually my decision to make. Our three commanders, who answer directly to Sebastian, must approve of you joining first. You must report to each of them, and they'll test if you're willing and able to fight against the mutants.}
{1100}{}{你现在是猎人了！哈，明白了。开玩笑的，这其实不是我的决定。我们的三个指挥官，直接对塞巴斯蒂安负责，必须首先同意你加入。你必须向他们每个人报告，他们会测试你是否愿意和有能力对抗突变体。}
#{1101}{}{Where will I find them?}
{1101}{}{我在哪里能找到他们？}
#{1102}{}{Cut the fucking jokes!}
{1102}{}{别开玩笑了！}
#{1103}{}{That's too much, I'm not interested.}
{1103}{}{太多了，我不感兴趣。}
#{1150}{}{My bad, no need to get so worked up. It was just a little joke.}
{1150}{}{我的错，没必要这么激动。只是个小玩笑。}
#{1151}{}{OK, where will I find the commanders?}
{1151}{}{好的，我在哪能找到指挥官？}
#{1152}{}{That joke will cost you your life!}
{1152}{}{那个笑话会让你丧命的！}
#{1200}{}{Dutch, who's in charge of the city defense, can usually be found near the entry gate to Albuquerque. Herman, who oversees internal matters of the city, is right in the next room. And you'd find the base commander Tulsa on the lower floor, if you had access there that is. But he sent me a message with instructions for you.}
{1200}{}{负责城市防御的达奇通常可以在阿尔伯克基的入口附近找到。负责城市内部事务的赫尔曼就在隔壁房间。如果你能进去的话，你会在楼下找到基地指挥官塔尔萨。但他给我发了一条信息，上面有你的指示。}
#{1201}{}{What about?}
{1201}{}{那怎么办？}
#{1250}{}{It won't be easy, many Hunters have tried and failed. Eh... Well, you're supposed to get us a pulse pistol, designated YK 32, from the empire. They seem really interested in that pistol technology and we want to know what all the fuss is about. One pistol will be enough, our technicians should be able to find out how it works then.}
{1250}{}{这并不容易，很多猎人都尝试过，但都失败了。呃。。。好吧，你应该从帝国给我们买一把脉冲手枪，代号YK32。他们似乎真的对手枪技术很感兴趣，我们想知道到底是怎么回事。一把手枪就够了，我们的技术人员到时候应该能知道它是怎么工作的。}
#{1251}{}{Does every newcomer get tasks like that?}
{1251}{}{每个新来的人都有这样的任务吗？}
#{1252}{}{Weren't Hunters and the empire supposed to be allies?}
{1252}{}{猎人和帝国不应该是盟友吗？}
#{1253}{}{If the Hunters couldn't get it done, what chance do I have?}
{1253}{}{如果猎人们做不到，我还有什么机会？}
#{1254}{}{OK, I'll be back.}
{1254}{}{好的，我会回来的。}
#{1300}{}{Nope. I think Sebastian is putting a lot of pressure on Tulsa to get the pulse pistol. You're just unlucky.}
{1300}{}{不。我想塞巴斯蒂安给塔尔萨施加了很大的压力，想要得到脉冲手枪。你真倒霉。}
#{1301}{}{Weren't Hunters and the empire supposed to be allies?}
{1301}{}{猎人和帝国不应该是盟友吗？}
#{1302}{}{If the Hunters couldn't get it done, what chance do I have?}
{1302}{}{如果猎人们做不到，我还有什么机会？}
#{1303}{}{OK, I'll be back.}
{1303}{}{好的，我会回来的。}
#{1350}{}{We're not really allies, it'd be more accurate to say that we have a deal. We're supposed to defend the city, but the empire doesn't help us with that a whole lot. If they gave us access to the technologies they're so secretive about, it'd be much easier. Our relations right now are pretty tense, actually. We're watching them, they're watching us, both groups trying to avoid each other. If you do manage to become a Mutant Hunter, don't expect a warm welcome in the empire. The stuck-up bastards probably won't like that you're even trying to join us if they find out. Don't underestimate this. If they have a reason to investigate what you're doing, there's no doubt they'd be able to find out you're working for us.}
{1350}{}{我们不是真正的盟友，更确切地说我们达成了协议。我们应该保卫这座城市，但帝国在这方面帮不了我们多少忙。如果他们能让我们接触到他们如此隐秘的技术，那就容易多了。实际上，我们现在的关系相当紧张。我们看着他们，他们看着我们，两组人都在试图避开对方。如果你真的想成为一名变种猎人，别指望帝国会热烈欢迎你。那些自命不凡的混蛋可能不会喜欢你，如果他们发现了你甚至想加入我们。别小看了。如果他们有理由调查你在做什么，毫无疑问他们会发现你在为我们工作。}
#{1351}{}{Does every newcomer get tasks like that?}
{1351}{}{每个新来的人都有这样的任务吗？}
#{1352}{}{If the Hunters couldn't get it done, what chance do I have?}
{1352}{}{如果猎人们做不到，我还有什么机会？}
#{1353}{}{OK, I'll be back.}
{1353}{}{好的，我会回来的。}
#{1354}{}{I don't want any trouble with the empire. I've changed my mind, I don't want to become a Hunter or help you anymore.}
{1354}{}{我不想和帝国有任何麻烦。我改变主意了，我不想再当猎人或帮助你了。}
#{1355}{}{I don't want any trouble with the empire. I've changed my mind, I don't want to become a Hunter or help you anymore.}
{1355}{}{我不想和帝国有任何麻烦。我改变主意了，我不想再当猎人或帮助你了。}
#{1400}{}{The fact that you're not one us yet might give you an advantage of sorts. It's hard for a foreigner to get into the Imperial City, but it's almost impossible for a Hunter. If they have a reason to inspect you, even doing the enlistment duties from the commanders could get you in trouble. But I'd say that's only a danger if you draw too much attention to yourself. I doubt they watch every single foreigner that happens to stroll by, so you should be OK.}
{1400}{}{你还不是我们中的一员，这可能会给你一些好处。外国人很难进入皇城，但猎人几乎不可能。如果他们有理由检查你，即使是从指挥官那里履行征兵职责也会给你带来麻烦。但我要说的是，如果你把太多的注意力放在自己身上，那才是危险的。我怀疑他们会看到每一个碰巧路过的外国人，所以你应该没事。}

#{1450}{}{If you say so, less work for me. Come back if you change your mind.}
{1450}{}{如果你这么说，我的工作就少了。如果你改变主意就回来。}
#{1451}{}{Goodbye.}
{1451}{}{再见。}

{2351}{}{对不起，那我就走。}
#{2352}{}{Bullshit, I'll just beat it out of you!}
{2352}{}{胡说，我就揍你一顿！}
#{2400}{}{Hardly. Nearly everyone is drooling over power armor, but we only have a small number of them. Sebastian himself decides who gets one.}
{2400}{}{几乎没有。几乎每个人都对能量护甲垂涎三尺，但我们只有一小部分。塞巴斯蒂安自己决定谁得到一个。}
#{2401}{}{Is there really no way to get it?}
{2401}{}{真的没有办法得到吗？}
#{2402}{}{I see.}
{2402}{}{我懂了。}
#{2450}{}{Maybe if you can make yourself invisible and magically open locks. We have one suit locked away in the armory, waiting for its next owner. After a few repairs it was as good as new, sadly, the same can't be said of it's previous owner.}
{2450}{}{也许你能让自己隐形，然后神奇地打开锁。我们把一套衣服锁在军械库里，等着它的下一个主人。经过几次修理，它和新的一样好，可悲的是，它以前的主人却不能说是一样的。}
#{2451}{}{I see.}
{2451}{}{我懂了。}
#{2500}{}{No, there isn't.}
{2500}{}{不，没有。}
#{2501}{}{I see.}
{2501}{}{我懂了。}
#{2502}{}{Bullshit, I'll just beat it out of you!}
{2502}{}{胡说，我就揍你一顿！}
#{2550}{}{Wait, you should go hear Sebastian's speech, it starts in a moment. The speeches are definitely worth it; they always fill me with energy and drive.}
{2550}{}{等等，你应该去听塞巴斯蒂安的演讲，马上就要开始了。这些演讲绝对值得，它们总是让我充满活力和干劲。}
#{2551}{}{OK.}
{2551}{}{好 啊。}
#{2600}{}{Great, wasn't it? Here's the record of the speech. [He gives you a holodisk.] It's worth reminding ourselves what we're fighting for sometimes.}
{2600}{}{太好了，不是吗？这是演讲的录音。[他给了你一张全息光盘]值得提醒我们自己，有时候我们在为什么而战。}
#{2601}{}{Thanks.}
{2601}{}{谢谢。}
#{2650}{}{And Tulsa said he wanted you to pay him a visit. Unless he's at the Wild Paradise, you really shouldn't disturb him there, he's usually slacking off in his room on the lower floor. You can access the lower floor now, his room is the second one from the elevator.}
{2650}{}{塔尔萨说他想让你去拜访他。除非他在野生天堂，否则你真的不应该在那里打扰他，他通常在楼下的房间里偷懒。你现在可以进入下一层了，他的房间在电梯的第二层。}
#{2651}{}{You don't speak very highly of him.}
{2651}{}{你对他评价不高。}
#{2652}{}{OK, I'll go to him.}
{2652}{}{好的，我去找他。}
#{2700}{}{That's because he's the one supposed to run this base, but in reality I have to do almost everything. Without me, this whole place would crumble like a house of cards.}
{2700}{}{那是因为他是这个基地的负责人，但实际上我几乎什么都要做。如果没有我，整个地方会像纸牌屋一样崩溃。}
#{2701}{}{I understand. That's usually how it goes, superiors living off the work of their subordinates. The only thing the working man gets is the blame for failure.}
{2701}{}{我理解。通常情况就是这样，上司靠下属的工作为生。工人唯一能得到的就是失败的责备。}
#{2702}{}{If you say so. I'll go to him then.}
{2702}{}{如果你这样说。那我就去找他。}
#{2750}{}{Yeah, exactly! You're probably the first person I met that gets it. Here, take two ultra stimpaks. I'll cover up their loss somehow. Tulsa won't know a thing.}
{2750}{}{是的，没错！你可能是我遇到的第一个明白的人。给，拿两个超薄的。我会设法弥补他们的损失。塔尔萨什么都不知道。}
#{2751}{}{Thanks.}
{2751}{}{谢谢。}
#{2800}{}{Wait, there was supposed to be a speech by Sebastian today, as usual. But it was cancelled. I don't know why, nobody told me anything, but you can take this record of one of his speeches at least. [He gives you a holodisk.] You should definitely come when he does have one, they always fill me with energy and drive.}
{2800}{}{等等，像往常一样，今天应该有塞巴斯蒂安的演讲。但是取消了。我不知道为什么，没人告诉我什么，但你至少可以把他的一次演讲录下来。[他给了你一张全息光盘。]当他有全息光盘的时候，你一定要来，他们总是让我充满活力和动力。}
#{2801}{}{Thanks.}
{2801}{}{谢谢。}
#{2850}{}{Do you need anything?}
{2850}{}{你需要什么吗？}
#{2851}{}{How can I get the big armor, like the one Dutch has?}
{2851}{}{我怎么能得到像荷兰人那样的大盔甲？}
#{2852}{}{I'm supposed to pick up my power armor here.}
{2852}{}{我应该在这里拿起我的能量盔甲。}
#{2853}{}{Can I ask you something?}
{2853}{}{我能问你件事吗？}
#{2854}{}{Nothing.}
{2854}{}{没有什么。}
#{2855}{}{Uff.}
{2855}{}{不明飞行物。}
#{2900}{}{Yeah, I got the message from Sebastian. We only have a few of those, so take good care of it - it might save your life. [He gives you the power armor.]}
{2900}{}{是的，我收到了塞巴斯蒂安的口信。我们只有几个，所以好好照顾它-它可能会救你的命。[他给你力量护甲。]}
#{2901}{}{OK.}
{2901}{}{好 啊。}
#{2950}{}{Yeah, I got the message from Sebastian. But... Ehh, what happened is... Well, someone must've stolen it or something, and we have no other free suits.}
{2950}{}{是的，我收到了塞巴斯蒂安的口信。但是。。。呃，发生的事是。。。好吧，肯定有人偷了它什么的，我们没有其他的免费西装。}
#{2951}{}{How could someone just steal it?!}
{2951}{}{怎么会有人偷走它？！}
#{2952}{}{Who could've done such a thing? Well, I guess I'd better get going.}
{2952}{}{谁会做这种事？好吧，我想我该走了。}
#{3000}{}{Yeah, I'd like to know that too. Though I'd be more interested to know how is Tulsa going to explain that to Sebastian.}
{3000}{}{是的，我也想知道。不过我更想知道塔尔萨会怎么跟塞巴斯蒂安解释。}
#{3001}{}{I'd better get going.}
{3001}{}{我得走了。}
#{3050}{}{You can, but make it quick. I don't have much time to spare.}
{3050}{}{你可以，但要快点。我没有太多的空闲时间。}
#{3051}{}{What can you tell me about mutants?}
{3051}{}{关于突变体你能告诉我什么？}
#{3052}{}{What can you tell me about the Rebirth?}
{3052}{}{关于重生你能告诉我什么？}
#{3053}{}{What can you tell me about Sebastian?}
{3053}{}{关于塞巴斯蒂安你能告诉我什么？}
#{3054}{}{What would you do if there weren't any mutants left?}
{3054}{}{如果没有变种你会怎么做？}
#{3055}{}{Can you tell me anything about an ex-Hunter called Sindian Harding-Stillson?}
{3055}{}{你能告诉我一个叫辛迪安・哈丁・斯蒂尔森的前猎人的情况吗？}
#{3056}{}{I won't keep you.}
{3056}{}{我不会留下你的。}
#{3100}{}{Mutants are a threat that we Mutant Hunters are trying to stop.}
{3100}{}{变种人是我们变种猎人试图阻止的威胁。}
#{3101}{}{But do you think it's necessary to pursue even people with only slight mutations?}
{3101}{}{但是你认为有必要去追查那些只有轻微变异的人吗？}
#{3102}{}{What can you tell me about the Rebirth?}
{3102}{}{关于重生你能告诉我什么？}
#{3103}{}{What can you tell me about Sebastian?}

{3105}{}{你能告诉我一个叫辛迪安・哈丁・斯蒂尔森的前猎人的情况吗？}
#{3106}{}{I won't keep you anymore.}
{3106}{}{我不会再留你了。}
#{3150}{}{It's doubtful they're still human in that case. Personally, I don't like when we have to kill them or amputate their limbs, but I do believe it's necessary. We're actually helping them, though they might not always understand that.}
{3150}{}{在那种情况下，他们是否还是人类是值得怀疑的。就我个人而言，我不喜欢我们必须杀死他们或截肢他们的四肢，但我相信这是必要的。我们实际上是在帮助他们，尽管他们可能并不总是明白这一点。}
#{3151}{}{What can you tell me about the Rebirth?}

#{3155}{}{I won't keep you anymore.}
{3155}{}{我不会再留你了。}
#{3200}{}{These days the Rebirth is a bigger threat than the remnants of the super mutants. Not only are they fanatical and well organized, they also have access to power armors and powerful energy weapons.}
{3200}{}{这些天的重生是一个更大的威胁比残余的超级变种。他们不仅狂热且组织严密，还拥有强大的盔甲和强大的能量武器。}

#{3300}{}{Sebastian is our leader and a great moral support for everyone here, myself included. There's been some strange talk about him recently, but I think it's just because a few of his planned speeches got cancelled.}
{3300}{}{塞巴斯蒂安是我们的领袖，也是这里每个人的精神支柱，包括我自己。最近有人说他有些奇怪，但我想这只是因为他计划中的几次演讲被取消了。}

{3400}{}{啊，好吧，我们不会接受你的。我很好奇是谁先让你进来的。}
#{3401}{}{Hrrr!}
{3401}{}{Hrrr！}
#{3402}{}{Uh.}
{3402}{}{休斯敦大学。}
#{3450}{}{Hey, take it easy. You wouldn't manage, you're just not cut to be a Hunter. Actually, your stupidity might've been caused by a mutation, so you'd better get lost.}
{3450}{}{嘿，别紧张。你不会成功的，你只是不适合当猎人。事实上，你的愚蠢可能是由基因突变引起的，所以你最好迷路。}
#{3451}{}{Grrr!}
{3451}{}{格瑞！}
#{3452}{}{Uh.}
{3452}{}{休斯敦大学。}
#{3500}{}{I've received a message from Herman that you'll never be a Hunter. Less work for me I guess.}
{3500}{}{我收到赫尔曼的消息说你永远不会成为猎人。我想我的工作量少了。}
#{3501}{}{Can't I do anything about it?}
{3501}{}{我能做些什么吗？}
#{3502}{}{That's just how it is.}
{3502}{}{事情就是这样。}
#{3503}{}{Ech.}
{3503}{}{Ech公司。}
#{3504}{}{Don't bother me. I've already told you you'll never be a Hunter.}
{3504}{}{别打扰我。我已经告诉过你你永远不会成为一个猎人。}
#{3550}{}{Nope. The commander's word carries a lot of weight, and in this case, everyone would agree with him. Not everything we do is pleasant, but it has to be done, and if you can't, then you're not fit to be a Hunter.}
{3550}{}{不。指挥官的话很有分量，在这种情况下，每个人都会同意他的话。并不是我们做的每件事都是愉快的，但它必须做，如果你做不到，那么你就不适合做一个猎人。}
#{3551}{}{I'm sick of your bullshit, so I'll just kill you all!}
{3551}{}{我受够了你的胡说八道，所以我要杀了你们所有人！}
#{3552}{}{[Leave.]}
{3552}{}{[离开]}
#{3600}{}{Ah, I've been waiting for you. All the commanders approve of you joining us. You're a Hunter now. For real this time.}
{3600}{}{啊，我一直在等你。所有的指挥官都赞成你加入我们。你现在是猎人了。这次是真的。}
#{3601}{}{Finally.}
{3601}{}{最后。}
#{3650}{}{Someone from the empire? Hold on. [He searches the computer records.] Interesting, he really was one of us for a time. But he betrayed us, and the whole human race, when he stood up for the mutants. If you know where he is, then... Ehh... Kill him. I don't like saying things like that, but someone like that doesn't deserve to live.}
{3650}{}{帝国的人？等等。[他搜索电脑记录]有趣的是，他曾经是我们中的一员。但是他背叛了我们，也背叛了整个人类，当他站出来支持变种人的时候。如果你知道他在哪里，那么。。。呃。。。杀了他。我不喜欢说那样的话，但这样的人不值得活下去。}

{3700}{}{不会发生的。他们警告过我关于你的事。听着，我不知道这是怎么回事，我只听说有人不喜欢你和帝国的关系。所以我们不会接受你。}
#{3701}{}{Your loss.}
{3701}{}{你的损失。}
#{3750}{}{Cool, but the Mutant Hunters don't want you. We know what goes on in the city and you're a bit too friendly with the local tribals. You're just not someone we can trust.}
{3750}{}{很酷，但是变种猎人不想要你。我们知道城里发生了什么，你对当地部落太友好了。你不是我们可以信任的人。}

#{3752}{}{What? What are you trying to say?}
{3752}{}{什么？你想说什么？}
#{3753}{}{Screw you.}
{3753}{}{去你的。}
#{3800}{}{Hey, it's not for me to decide. But the fact is that mutation tends to be most common among tribals, so it might spread to you soon. Besides, I don't think we could count on you being able to crack down on the mutants from their ranks if necessary.}
{3800}{}{嘿，这不是我能决定的。但事实是，变异往往是最常见的部落，所以它可能会传播给你很快。另外，如果有必要的话，我认为我们不能指望你能从他们的队伍中打击变种人。}
#{3801}{}{Hey, it's not for me to decide. But the fact is that mutation tends to be most common among tribals, so it might spread to you soon. Besides, I don't think we could count on you being able to crack down on the mutants from their ranks if necessary.}

#{3854}{}{Uff.}

#{3900}{}{Eh... What? Really? Well, I guess even you could still do that. You should go see commander Herman, his room is right next door.}
{3900}{}{呃。。。什么？真正地？好吧，我想即使是你也可以这么做。你应该去见赫尔曼指挥官，他的房间就在隔壁。}
#{3901}{}{OK.}
{3901}{}{好 啊。}
#{3950}{}{Seriously? Shouldn't you be begging your pal the emperor to give you a job?}

{4000}{}{别紧张。我想说的是，再也没有人愿意在这里见到你了。}
#{4001}{}{OK, I get it.}
{4001}{}{好的，我明白了。}
#{4050}{}{It's you. Alright, I got the report from the doctor that you're fine. But there's another problem.}
{4050}{}{是你。好吧，医生告诉我你没事。但还有一个问题。}
#{4051}{}{What?}

{4103}{}{去你的。}
#{4150}{}{What are you doing here? Didn't anyone tell you you can't join the Hunters anymore? Of course, it's up to me then. Look, whatever the commanders wanted from you, just forget about it. We don't want you.}
{4150}{}{你在这里干什么？没人告诉你你不能再加入猎人了吗？当然，那就看我了。听着，不管指挥官想从你这里得到什么，算了吧。我们不要你。}
#{4151}{}{Why, what happened?}
{4151}{}{怎么了，怎么了？}
#{4152}{}{If you say so. Your loss.}

{4300}{}{啊，是你。我收到医生的报告。我相信他已经告诉过你为什么你永远不会成为一个猎人了。别再烦我了，我不能，也不想，做任何事。}
#{4301}{}{Please, stop bothering me. Both me and doctor Yaotzin have told you quite clearly that you'll never be accepted into the Hunters.}

#{4305}{}{Uff.}
