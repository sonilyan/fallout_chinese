#{103}{}{The siren on the dam has turned on. Surely it's the work of that cleaner from above.}
{103}{}{大坝上的警报器已经打开了。肯定是上面那个清洁工干的。}
#{104}{}{Just wait, you son of a bitch!}
{104}{}{等等，你这狗娘养的！}
#{110}{}{[Before you stands a regular janitor with a brush in his hand, he frowns, noticing that you're approaching]}
{110}{}{[在你站在一个手里拿着刷子的普通看门人面前，他皱着眉头，注意到你正在靠近]}

{117}{}{哦，对不起，我受够了这个，水坝和所有的拉斯维加斯。只有问题，没有稳定。}
#{118}{}{Don't like? It's not the proper words! I can't stand it anymore. Recently, they cut my salary again. And the rumor has it that the Clean City will soon take the stocks, and then we are all done. They will replace us with someone cooler, and put us all under the knife to avoid sabotages. I don't want to wait for these times to come, it is better to think about the future in advance.}
{118}{}{你不喜欢吗？这不是恰当的措辞！我再也受不了了。最近，他们又给我减薪了。有传言说清洁城市很快就会接管股票，然后我们就都完了。他们会用更酷的人代替我们，把我们都置于刀下以避免破坏。我不想等待这些时候的到来，最好提前考虑未来。}

#{122}{}{Okay, look, I know a special password for emergencies. And I'll tell it if you compensate all the money that these administrative nits have underpaid me. It is 1000 bucks. Well, a deal?}
{122}{}{好吧，听着，我知道紧急情况下的特殊密码。我会告诉你，如果你赔偿这些行政笨蛋欠我的钱。1000美元。好吧，成交？}
#{123}{}{The price is fine with me. Here's the money, give me the password.}
{123}{}{这个价格我可以接受。这是钱，给我密码。}
#{124}{}{Not a deal. I'll just wipe you out and take your pass card.}

{127}{}{[鬼鬼祟祟地环顾四周，迅速把钱藏起来]嘘！没必要在这么暴露的地方对我们妥协！好吧，听着...【工人悄悄拨打密码，离开坝址】}
#{128}{}{[Go your own way]}
{128}{}{[走自己的路]}
#{129}{}{Right, I have heard of people like you. Playing tough, intimidating others, but push them against the wall - and they will wet their knees with urine, right?}
{129}{}{对，我听说过像你这样的人。耍强硬，恐吓别人，但把他们推到墙上-他们会尿湿膝盖，对吧？}

{130}{}{[紧张地拔出武器对准工人]}
#{131}{}{Then we will do it on your terms. Here's the money, give me the password.}

#{132}{}{Hey, hey, take it easy! Such jokes are up to no good!!}
{132}{}{嘿，嘿，别紧张！这样的笑话是没有用的！！}
#{133}{}{Damn it, tell me the password, bitch! Tell me before I get angry!}
{133}{}{该死，告诉我密码，婊子！在我生气之前告诉我！}
#{134}{}{[The knees of the worker buckle and the wet spots appear on his pants] P-please don't! I'll tell you! Just don't touch me!}

#{144}{}{You're so tense, baby, you just need to relax. Do you want me to keep you company?}
{144}{}{你太紧张了，宝贝，你只需要放松一下。你要我陪你吗？}
#{145}{}{[Smiles from ear to ear] Speaking of, dId I stuck here for all day for nothing? Okay, let's go, I will show you the dam. Look, we have a secluded place here, also I have some beer lying around, somewhere under my bed.}
{145}{}{[笑得合不拢嘴]说到这里，我是不是白呆了一整天？好的，我们走吧，我带你去看水坝。你看，我们这儿有个僻静的地方，我床底下有啤酒。}

{152}{}{[绕着大坝走的时候，那名工人因为勇气而喝酒，最后喝得酩酊大醉，他把你带到厕所，把你按在墙上，然后开始缠着你的乳房，抓你的屁股]}
