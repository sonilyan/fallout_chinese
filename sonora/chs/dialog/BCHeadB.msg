### {102}{}{Go in peace, strange iron spirit.}
{102}{}{平平安安地走吧，奇怪的铁精灵。}

### {200}{}{Greetings to you and your tribe. Aren't people whispering about you in San Brahmin? I don't know how to treat you, but I don't mind your presence.}
{200}{}{问候你和你的部落。在圣婆罗门，人们不是在窃窃私语吗？我不知道该如何对待你，但我不介意你在场。}
### {201}{}{Really?}
{201}{}{真正地}
### {202}{}{You've made me happy, old man.}
{202}{}{你让我很开心，老人。}
### {203}{}{I often do business with outsiders from the east, unlike the rest of the clans of the tribe. Time will tell if you can be trusted.}
{203}{}{我经常与来自东方的外来者做生意，不像部落的其他部族。时间会告诉你是否值得信任。}
### {204}{}{Thank you for your hospitality.}
{204}{}{谢谢你的盛情款待。}
### {205}{}{It's too rude for a first greeting.}
{205}{}{第一次打招呼太粗鲁了。}

### {210}{}{That thing you're driving has scared all my brahmins away! Choose a different road next time, you idiot.}
{210}{}{你开的那辆车把我所有的婆罗门都吓跑了！下次选择另一条路，你这个白痴。}
### {1210}{}{That thing you're driving has scared all my brahmins away! Next time, choose a different road.}

### {212}{}{Your problems. It's not my fault that your brahms are so skittish.}
{212}{}{你的问题。你的勃拉姆斯如此不稳定不是我的错。}

### {220}{}{I see you're not going to leave the pueblo. What's keeping you here, friend?}
{220}{}{我知道你不会离开普韦布洛。是什么把你留在这里的，朋友？}
### {221}{}{I see you're not going to leave the pueblo. What's on your mind?}
{221}{}{我知道你不会离开普韦布洛。你在想什么？}

### {223}{}{See you later, Genaro.}
{223}{}{再见，Genaro。}

### {230}{}{I ask you to advocate for an alliance with the Phoenix missionaries.}
{230}{}{我请你倡导与凤凰城传教士结盟。}
### {231}{}{Unlike the other elders, I have no prejudice against outsiders from Phoenix. My clan spent quite a lot of time with them, doing trade. But I'm not ready to go against the rest of the tribe. Maybe it's not time yet.}
{231}{}{与其他长辈不同，我对凤凰城的外人没有偏见。我的家族花了很多时间和他们在一起，做贸易。但我还没有准备好与部落其他人对抗。也许现在还不是时候。}
### {232}{}{If the elders are not convinced, then the war will not end.}
{232}{}{如果长老们不信服，那么战争就不会结束。}
### {233}{}{You underestimate the tribe. We have a wealth of combat experience and we know the Sonoran wasteland well. The Phoenix Army will be mired in this struggle for a long time, if it decides to go to the end at all.}
{233}{}{你低估了部落。我们有丰富的作战经验，我们非常了解索诺兰荒原。如果凤凰军决定走到最后，它将在这场斗争中陷入很长一段时间。}
### {234}{}{Your words sound convincing. Forget what I told you.}
{234}{}{你的话听起来很有说服力。忘了我告诉你的。}

### {235}{}{You're condemning your tribe to war. Mark my words.}
{235}{}{你在谴责你的部落发动战争。记下我的话。}
### {236}{}{Perhaps it is your voice that is not enough to change something. You don't want a war with the Phoenix, do you?}
{236}{}{也许是你的声音不足以改变某些事情。你不想和凤凰城开战，是吗？}
### {237}{}{The tribe can stand up for itself, but this war will be endless. And someday it will end in defeat before the growing technologies of missionaries.}
{237}{}{部落可以为自己挺身而出，但这场战争将是无休止的。总有一天，它会在传教士不断增长的技术面前以失败告终。}
### {238}{}{Do you agree with me?}
{238}{}{你同意我的观点吗？}
### {239}{}{I'm not averse to trading with Phoenix myself. The other elders don't understand that the world has changed. It is better now to enter a new era with full strength than to condemn our people to a century-long war. You can count on my support at the council of Elders.}
{239}{}{我本人并不反对与菲尼克斯进行交易。其他长辈不明白世界已经改变了。与其让我们的人民陷入长达一个世纪的战争，不如现在全力进入一个新时代。你可以指望我在长老会的支持。}

{240}{}{你的选择是正确的Genaro长官。}

### {243}{}{So I can count on you?}
{243}{}{所以我可以指望你？}
### {244}{}{Perhaps the Divine Brahmin punished me by taking the life of a sacred brahmin right before the celebration of the Day of the Sun. It's a sign. So he points out to me that I have chosen the wrong path.}
{244}{}{也许神圣的婆罗门惩罚了我，在庆祝太阳日之前夺走了一位神圣婆罗门的生命。这是一个迹象。所以他向我指出，我选择了错误的道路。}
### {245}{}{Now you know what to do, don't you?}
{245}{}{现在你知道该怎么办了，不是吗？}
### {246}{}{Great. But let's not rush things. Bye.}

### {255}{}{What are you doing here?}
{255}{}{你在这里干什么？}
### {256}{}{I spend a lot of time in San Brahmin. We need to keep an eye on the Brahmins after their grazing, prepare them for their future fate, after all, I arrange holidays on the day of the Big Sun. And I have more and more work, I can barely cope.}
{256}{}{我花了很多时间在圣婆罗门。我们需要在婆罗门放牧后密切关注他们，为他们未来的命运做好准备，毕竟，我会在大太阳那天安排假期。而且我的工作越来越多，我几乎应付不了。}
### {257}{}{I see.}
{257}{}{我明白了。}
### {258}{}{Can I help you?}
{258}{}{我能帮你吗？}
### {259}{}{Didn't you have to cultivate maize before? So, working with the land should not be a burden for you. Take a shovel in the paddock and clean it from... brahmin filth. Brahmins must be clean while they are in captivity. Especially the ones I chose to celebrate the Day of the Sun.}
{259}{}{你以前不是要种玉米吗？所以，在土地上工作对你来说不应该是一种负担。在围场里拿一把铲子，把它从...婆罗门的污秽。婆罗门在被囚禁期间必须保持清洁。尤其是那些我选择庆祝太阳日的人。}
### {260}{}{Okay. I will do it. I hope you will at least feed me fresh brahmin meat for this.}
{260}{}{可以我会做的。我希望你至少能给我喂新鲜的婆罗门肉。}
### {261}{}{What about? Cleaning up the shit behind the Brahmins?}
{261}{}{那么...怎么样清理婆罗门背后的垃圾？}
### {262}{}{Isn't this a common thing for you? Well, I can't offer you another job. You can hardly handle the dressing of hides or the care of Brahmins. To be honest, I try not to let strangers into the pen at all. It's a pity that you don't appreciate the trust placed in you.}
{262}{}{这对你来说不是很平常吗？我不能再给你一份工作了。你很难处理兽皮的打扮或婆罗门的护理。老实说，我尽量不让陌生人进入围栏。很遗憾，你没有感激别人对你的信任。}
### {263}{}{I think you're just kidding me. Look for fools.}
{263}{}{我想你只是在开玩笑。找傻瓜。}
### {264}{}{The pen is cleared.}
{264}{}{笔已清除。}
### {265}{}{I see. You did a good job.}
{265}{}{我明白了。你做得很好。}

{266}{}{你在开玩笑吗？我被婆罗门的大便弄得耳朵都竖起来了！}
### {267}{}{Oh, thank you, I love doing my job flawlessly.}
{267}{}{哦，谢谢你，我喜欢完美地完成我的工作。}
### {268}{}{For such work, it's not a pity to feed and give a bed in my tent. Take this jerky. It satisfies hunger well on the road and does not spoil for a very long time.}
{268}{}{对于这样的工作，在我的帐篷里喂养和提供一张床并不可惜。拿着这个肉干。它在路上很好地满足了饥饿感，而且在很长一段时间内都不会变质。}
### {269}{}{Thank you.}
{269}{}{非常感谢。}
### {270}{}{Don't laugh at my back.}
{270}{}{别嘲笑我。}

{280}{}{在我们的别墅里有传言说瓦奎罗部落放牛。}
### {281}{}{Hmm?}

{282}{}{这些故事引起了很多混乱。你是如何驯服狂躁的婆罗门的？}
### {283}{}{Come on, forget it.}
{283}{}{来吧，忘了它。}
### {284}{}{They weren't always like that. A few generations ago, Brahmins were common pets. Legends say that Heaven punished people for their misdeeds by making animals rabid.}
{284}{}{他们并不总是那样。几代人以前，婆罗门是常见的宠物。传说，上天惩罚人们的恶行，使动物患狂犬病。}
### {285}{}{Go on, Shaman Genaro.}
{285}{}{继续，萨满吉纳罗。}
### {286}{}{The Brahmins scattered across the desert, refused to return to the stalls and hid from people. Their temper became wild. But our ancestors preserved several Brahmins thanks to prayers and offerings to the Divine Brahmin.}
{286}{}{婆罗门们分散在沙漠中，拒绝回到摊位上，躲避人们。他们的脾气变得暴躁起来。但我们的祖先保存了几个婆罗门感谢祈祷和供奉神圣的婆罗门。}

{287}{}{谢谢你的故事。}
### {288}{}{And why does a brahmin need a second head?}
{288}{}{为什么婆罗门需要第二个头？}
### {289}{}{(shrugs his shoulders in surprise) The ways of the Divine Brahmin are inscrutable. But I believe that this is how two Brahmins merged into one body for better protection from people and animals.}
{289}{}{（惊讶地耸耸肩）神圣婆罗门的方式是不可思议的。但我相信，这就是两个婆罗门如何融合为一个身体，以更好地保护人们和动物。}
### {290}{}{A reasonable explanation. In two heads it will be easier to monitor the situation around.}
{290}{}{合理的解释。在两个头脑中，监控周围的情况会更容易。}
### {291}{}{You even find a divine explanation for ordinary ugliness. There's something unhealthy about it...}

### {300}{}{Can I buy a brahmin here?}

### {310}{}{Tell me, what else is this Buried City that the children are talking about?}
{310}{}{告诉我，孩子们在谈论的这个被埋葬的城市还有什么？}
### {311}{}{Don't go there alone. This place has a bad reputation. Sometimes animal bones are found there, and occasionally even human remains. The spirits cannot reveal to me the secret of this place.}
{311}{}{不要一个人去那里。这个地方名声不好。有时在那里会发现动物的骨头，偶尔甚至会发现人类的遗骸。鬼魂无法向我透露这个地方的秘密。}
### {312}{}{Is that why you forbid children to appear there?}
{312}{}{这就是你禁止孩子们出现在那里的原因吗？}
### {313}{}{Who knows what ancient evil lurks in the dark and confusing dungeon of the old pueblo?}

{316}{}{现在我知道了在被埋葬的城市里藏着什么。人们和勃拉姆斯被一个怪物绑架了。}
### {317}{}{A monster! We have been trying for a long time to figure out who is stealing our cattle, but this dark spirit skillfully hid from my eagle vision. And yet it exists.}
{317}{}{怪物！很长一段时间以来，我们一直试图弄清楚是谁在偷我们的牛，但这个黑暗的灵魂巧妙地隐藏在我鹰的视野之外。然而它是存在的。}

{318}{}{黑暗的灵魂已经堕落。他不会再打扰你了。}
### {319}{}{Thank heaven! The Divine Brahmin himself must have sent you to us. Thank you, friend. We will remember your exploits for generations.}
{319}{}{感谢上帝！神圣的婆罗门一定把你送到了我们这里。谢谢你，朋友。我们将世世代代铭记你们的功绩。}
### {320}{}{Oh, yes, I can already see the children gathered around the campfire. And the shaman in the center, who tells them about me... But I have to go. There are still many lives to be saved.}
