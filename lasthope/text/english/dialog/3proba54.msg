#info...
{119}{}{Sure, I can spare a few minutes. It's so eerily quiet most of the time. What do you want to know?}
{120}{}{What's going on in this "town"?}
{121}{}{Where can I buy something for my own protection?}
{122}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
#going on in town...
{123}{}{Well, west of here we got a power plant and I hear the administration is looking for some extra security. You
 see, the power plant is often targeted by bandits, this year is no exception. Bandits want the uranium ore, and they want
 it so bad they are just lining up in front of a firing squad. I don't know what drives those people, poverty or insanity.
 [Sighs.] Poor bastards are maybe forced to do this and have no other choice, some of them were really young...}
{124}{}{That's terrible. Speaking about trouble, can I get some weapons around here?}
#weaponry...
{125}{}{I really don't know. I work here in the bar and that's all I do. But I know Brian has his own arsenal down in
 the power plant, that's for sure.}
{126}{}{How about you tell me what's going on in town?}
#
{127}{}{Here's what we have on the menu.}
{128}{}{Here's what drinks we have.}
#21.9.2017
{129}{}{What do they need uranium for?}
{130}{}{Well, it's not like they are making a bomb or something. So my guess is they would sell it to whoever offers the most.}
{131}{}{I see.}
