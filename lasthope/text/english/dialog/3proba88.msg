{100}{}{Welcome, stranger. This is my bar "Drink & Meal" and I'm Mary. So, what can I offer you today?}
{101}{}{Some food would be great.}
{102}{}{I'd like to drink something.}
{103}{}{Can I get some info?}
{104}{}{Nothing today, thanks.}
#
{105}{}{Welcome back, stranger. Can I get you something?}
#food...
{106}{}{Here's what we got...}
{107}{}{(Rat-pie...................$10)}
{108}{}{(Roasted-desert-lizard.....$20)}
{109}{}{(Iguana-on-a-stick.........$20)}
{110}{}{(Brahmin cutlets...........$40)}
{111}{}{Actually, I need something else.}
{112}{}{I don't have the money right now. I'll be back later.}
#else...
{113}{}{Sure thing, just say what you need?}
#drink...
{114}{}{OK. Let me show you what I have...}
{115}{}{(Beer..............$5)}
{116}{}{(Nuka Cola.........$4)}
{117}{}{(Booze.............$5)}
{118}{}{(Water.............$20)}
{119}{}{Actually, I need something else.}
{120}{}{I can't afford that much money right now.}
#
{121}{}{Anything else?}
#
{122}{}{Hey, you'll have to pay if you want to eat something. Show me the money or get out!}
{123}{}{Sorry, no money. I'm going.}
{124}{}{Shut your mouth lady, or I'll have to shut it for you.}
#
{125}{}{Hey, you'll have to pay if you want to drink something. Show me the money or get out!}
#info...
{126}{}{Sure, what you wanna know?}
{127}{}{Anything interesting going on here?}
{128}{}{Know any place where I might find a job?}
{129}{}{Nothing actually, I want something else.}
#going on...
{130}{}{I don't have much free time because of my job, but as I usually spend my whole day here, I often get to hear
 some interesting rumors. Wanna hear some of them?}
{131}{}{Sure, I'm listening.}
{132}{}{No thanks, I want to ask you something.}
#sure...
{133}{}{There's one about Mr. Donson and his "dirty" business. The other one, about missing people, is, however,
 more interesting. Hmm... That's all I can remember for now, I better write down any new ones. So, wanna hear them or
 what?}
{134}{}{Tell me about Mr. Donson.}
{135}{}{What about the missing people?}
{136}{}{Not interested, let me ask you something else.}
#mr.Donson...
{137}{}{Let me see... I can't be sure about this one but word is going around that our mayor has "some" illegal
 sources of income.}
{138}{}{Is it true?}
#
{139}{}{If you ask me, I don't believe it. Mr. Donson is a respectable and honest man. He invested a lot in this
 town and restored it from its previous disintegrated state. Only malicious and very delusional people could start such
 rumors.}
{140}{}{If you say so. What about the missing people?}
{141}{}{Right. Let me ask you something else.}
#missing people...
{142}{}{It first started as a rumor, but quickly became a nightmare. Some are suspecting wild animals from the
 forest, while others think they just left town. In fact, nobody knows for sure because these people, well, they never
 returned.}
{143}{}{Strange... What can you tell about Mr. Donson?}
{144}{}{Hmm... Can I ask you something?}
#know about some job?
{145}{}{I really don't know, but if you are interested, I need someone to get me some empty bottles. I got a brandy still
 but I don't have anything to fill it in. I'm willing to pay $950 for them, so... what do you say?}
{146}{}{Sounds good.}
{147}{}{I don't know, maybe later.}
#sounds good...
{148}{}{Great, I'll need twenty. When you get them, just bring them to me. It's a deal?}
{149}{}{You got it.}
#maybe later...
{150}{}{OK, I understand. I don't need them right now, so come back later if you want the job. Before you go, can I
 help you with something else?}
{151}{}{I'd like to ask you something?}
{152}{}{No, thanks.}
#
{153}{}{About that job...}
#
{154}{}{Yes?}
{155}{}{I'll take it.}
{156}{}{Nothing, sorry to bother you.}
#
{157}{}{I got twenty bottles right here. [Hand her the bottles.]}
{158}{}{Nothing, sorry to bother you.}
#bottles...
{159}{}{Thank you very much. You've done a perfect job, bottles look good, which gives you a little bonus. Here's
 $1500 for you. [Gives you the money.] I know this amount won't last me long but I couldn't ask more of you. I'll try to
 secure a supplier from now on. Thanks again.}
{160}{}{No problem. I'm glad I could help.}
