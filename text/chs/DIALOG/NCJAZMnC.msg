#{104}{}{Person of color. That's an important phrase.}
{104}{}{有色人种。这句话很重要。}
#{105}{}{Once upon a time, we had our own hoods. Whites never went there.}
{105}{}{从前，我们有自己的头巾。怀特从未去过那里。}
#{106}{}{My grandma wouldn't have been against what I'm doing.}
{106}{}{我奶奶不会反对我的所作所为的。}
#{108}{}{You know, you're one of the best whites I ever met.}
{108}{}{你知道，你是我见过的最好的白人之一。}
#{109}{}{Good idea, but I doubt it's that easy.}
{109}{}{好主意，但我觉得没那么容易。}
#{110}{}{[You see a black man in strange clothes decorated with studs and delicate patches on the collar and sleeves. He's concentrated on tuning the strings on his guitar.] You're distracting me. And when I'm distracted, I'm pissed. What do you need, whitey boy?}
{110}{}{[你看到一个穿着奇怪衣服的黑人，衣领和袖子上饰有饰钉和精致的补丁。他全神贯注地调吉他上的琴弦[你在分散我的注意力]。当我分心的时候，我会很生气。你需要什么，白小子？}
#{111}{}{Why'd you call me "whitey boy"?}
{111}{}{你为什么叫我“白人男孩”？}
#{112}{}{Cause you're the whitest white bastard I've ever seen! Look at your skin, it's so white like it has never seen the sun! Where are you from, a dungeon? Did you grow up in a basement? Whatever, I don't care. What do you need?}
{112}{}{因为你是我见过的最白人的混蛋！你看你的皮肤，白得像没见过太阳！你从哪里来，地牢？你是在地下室长大的吗？不管怎样，我不在乎。你需要什么？}
#{113}{}{I'm forming a jazz band for the Cotton Club. Wanna join?}
{113}{}{我要为棉花俱乐部组建一支爵士乐队。想加入吗？}
#{114}{}{Never mind.}
{114}{}{不要介意。}
#{115}{}{Jazz is good. The voice of my people. [his voice goes hard] *My* people.}
{115}{}{爵士乐很好。我人民的声音。[他的声音变得强硬]*我的*人民。}
#{116}{}{Your people, my people - we're all the same color on the inside, aren't we? Why not break down the barriers and play jazz for everyone?}
{116}{}{你的人，我的人-我们内心都是一样的颜色，不是吗？为什么不打破障碍，为大家演奏爵士乐呢？}
#{117}{}{You see, we have a family, everyone's helping everyone. And then you come here and try to barge into this family, acting as leader. Either you're feeding me a line, or you really don't get it. And I don't know what pisses me off more.}
{117}{}{你看，我们有一个家庭，每个人都在帮助每个人。然后你来到这里，试图闯入这个家庭，扮演领导者的角色。要么你给我一条线，要么你真的不明白。我不知道是什么让我更生气。}
#{118}{}{Does it matter? We could do great things if we work together, trust me.}
{118}{}{有关系吗？相信我，如果我们一起工作，我们可以做大事。}
#{119}{}{Yeeeaaah... I can be sure about that, but not about you. I live music, I don't sell it, you get that? And, to share this passion, I need to be sure about my partner. Some things still matter in this world, now maybe more than ever. And, on top of all, you're white. Look, prove to our family that you can be trusted - and I'll go with you.}
{119}{}{是啊。。。我可以肯定，但你不能。我靠音乐为生，我不卖，明白吗？为了分享这份激情，我需要确定我的搭档。有些事情在这个世界上仍然重要，现在也许比以往任何时候都重要。最重要的是，你是白人。听着，向我们的家人证明你是可以信任的-我会和你一起去的。}
#{120}{}{By family, you mean the slums, right? I need to think about it.}
{120}{}{你说的家庭，是指贫民窟吧？我需要考虑一下。}
#{121}{}{I've already said everything. I won't work with you until the hood has something good to say about you.}
{121}{}{我什么都说了。我不会和你一起工作，除非胡德对你有好话要说。}
#{122}{}{Alright.}
{122}{}{好吧。}
#{123}{}{Do you play on stage?}
{123}{}{你在舞台上表演吗？}
#{124}{}{I play only for our own. Well, unless you count Wright's parties, but he hasn't organized those in a while. As for playing on stage solo - I'm not sure. Wrong times.}
{124}{}{我只为我们自己打球。嗯，除非你算上赖特的派对，但他已经有一段时间没组织了。至于在舞台上独奏-我不确定。时间不对。}
#{125}{}{Have I done enough for the neighborhood for you to trust me?}
{125}{}{我已经为邻居做了足够的事让你相信我了吗？}
#{126}{}{You know, you're not bad. For a whitey. Fine, count me in. But I don't want to work alone - it's dangerous in this town. There's a war going on, after all.}
{126}{}{你知道，你还不错。为了一个白人。好吧，算我一个。但我不想一个人工作-在这个镇上很危险。毕竟，战争还在继续。}

{1108}{}{你知道，你是个好人。}
#{1110}{}{[You see a black man in strange clothes decorated with studs and delicate patches on the collar and sleeves. He's concentrating on tuning the strings on his guitar.] You're distracting me. And when I'm distracted, I'm pissed. What do you need, whitey girl?}
{1110}{}{[你看到一个穿着奇怪衣服的黑人，衣领和袖子上饰有饰钉和精致的补丁。他正专心于调吉他上的弦[你在分散我的注意力]。当我分心的时候，我会很生气。你需要什么，白人女孩？}
#{1111}{}{Why'd you call me "whitey girl"?}
{1111}{}{你为什么叫我“白人女孩”？}
#{1112}{}{Cause you're the whitest white bitch I've ever seen! Look at your skin, it's so white like it has never seen the sun! Where are you from, a dungeon? Did you grow up in a basement? Whatever, I don't care. What do you need?}
{1112}{}{因为你是我见过的最白人的婊子！你看你的皮肤，白得像没见过太阳！你从哪里来，地牢？你是在地下室长大的吗？不管怎样，我不在乎。你需要什么？}
#{1115}{}{Jazz is good. The voice of my people. [his voice goes hard] *My* people.}
