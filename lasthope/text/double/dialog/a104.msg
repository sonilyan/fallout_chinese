{100}{}{嘿，陌生人。是什么把你带到我们镇上来的？ -- Hey there, stranger. What brings you to our town?}
### {101}{}{I'm just passing by. Say, what is this place?}
{101}{}{我只是路过。喂，这是什么地方？ -- I'm just passing by. Say, what is this place?}
### {102}{}{Well, I'm a mere traveler. Who are you?}
{102}{}{嗯，我只是一个旅行者。你是谁？ -- Well, I'm a mere traveler. Who are you?}

{103}{}{对不起，没时间说话。 -- Sorry, no time to talk.}
### {104}{}{This is our caravan office, if you can call it that. You see, caravans used to go from town to town, trading goods and all that... But times aren't good for us anymore. Raiders and bandits gave us so much trouble in the past we were forced to stop organizing caravans.}
{104}{}{这是我们的房车办公室，如果你可以这么称呼的话。你看，大篷车过去常常从一个城镇到另一个城镇，交易货物等等。。。但时代对我们来说已经不好了。过去，袭击者和土匪给我们带来了太多麻烦，我们被迫停止组织大篷车。 -- This is our caravan office, if you can call it that. You see, caravans used to go from town to town, trading goods and all that... But times aren't good for us anymore.

### {105}{}{I see. How's the situation now?}
{105}{}{我明白了。现在情况如何？ -- I see. How's the situation now?}
### {106}{}{It's not getting any better. Well, some of my men are traveling across the wasteland, selling our goods for equipment, food... Enough to stay in business. Also, bandits disguised as caravans used to get into towns... So, many of them were forced to forbid trading with caravans. Slowly over time, caravans stopped to exist altogether. Some of them are still traveling the wasteland though, pushing their luck, hoping for better days. [Laughs.]}
{106}{}{情况没有好转。嗯，我的一些人正在荒原上旅行，出售我们的设备、食品。。。足够做生意了。此外，伪装成大篷车的土匪过去常常进入城镇。。。因此，他们中的许多人被迫禁止与大篷车进行交易。随着时间的推移，商队慢慢地停止了存在。他们中的一些人仍然在荒原上旅行，碰碰运气，希望有更好的日子。[大笑。] -- It's not getting any better. Well, some of my men are traveling across the wasteland, selling our goods for equipment, food... Enough to stay in business. Also, bandits disguised as caravans used to get into towns...

{108}{}{很高兴和你交谈。我现在得走了。 -- Nice talking to you. I have to go now.}
### {109}{}{I usually check Philton. Most of our stock goes there. It's a big town with a lot of demand for our ore, but with that crazy mayor Donson in charge... better keep away from that guy.}
{109}{}{我通常检查菲尔顿。我们的大部分存货都在那里。这是一个对我们的矿石有很多需求的大城镇，但有那个疯狂的市长唐森负责。。。最好离那个家伙远点。 -- I usually check Philton. Most of our stock goes there. It's a big town with a lot of demand for our ore, but with that crazy mayor Donson in charge... better keep away from that guy.}
### {110}{}{What can you tell me about Donson?}
{110}{}{关于唐森，你能告诉我什么？ -- What can you tell me about Donson?}
### {111}{}{Well, I can tell you more than those folks. Because Donson keeps everything under his control. And there's a rumor going round that he's responsible for some missing people. [He raises an eyebrow.] Anyway, it's not my job to look for the truth, frankly, I don't care as long as I get paid.}
{111}{}{好吧，我可以告诉你比那些人更多。因为唐森控制着一切。有传言说他对一些失踪人员负有责任。[他扬起眉毛。]不管怎样，我的工作不是寻找真相，坦率地说，只要我有报酬，我就不在乎。 -- Well, I can tell you more than those folks. Because Donson keeps everything under his control.

{122}{}{是的，我能帮你什么陌生人？ -- Yes, how can I help you stranger?}
### {123}{}{Not exactly. You see, we used to have caravans but for a long time we had many problems with bandits. So, we were forced to cancel many shipments that were more vulnerable to sudden attacks. We tried everything, it just doesn't seem to work.}
{123}{}{不完全是。你看，我们以前有大篷车，但很长一段时间以来，我们与土匪有很多问题。因此，我们被迫取消了许多更容易受到突然袭击的货物。我们什么都试过了，但似乎都不起作用。 -- Not exactly. You see, we used to have caravans but for a long time we had many problems with bandits.

{131}{}{嗯，有一些事情正在发生，但没有什么有趣的。一些死爪在城市里游荡，我的表哥也看到了它们。我打赌这些东西不是来找乐子的。你知道他们怎么说的，哪里有猎人，哪里就有猎物。杰瑞，当地治安官，可以告诉你更多。。。 -- Well, there are a few things going on but nothing interesting.

### {135}{}{We have an old mine here in town, you have probably heard about it. The problem is that it's too old and many workers refuse to work down there.

{135}{}{我们镇上有一个旧矿井，你可能听说过。问题是它太旧了，很多工人拒绝在那里工作。虽然该镇必须继续生产贸易商品，但问题仍然存在，在那里工作安全吗？因此，这个小镇面临着一个巨大的困境，我们是应该让矿场再运营几年，直到我们建造一个新的矿场，还是。。。自从我们最信任的公民Jerry走了之后，事情并没有变得更容易。。。愿他安息。。。他知道该怎么做。。。 -- We have an old mine here in town, you have probably heard about it.

{137}{}{好吧，看起来那些死爪不会打扰我们，至少在一段时间内，我想。只是。。。可惜杰瑞没来。我会想念他们的。就像我说的，我们镇上有一个老矿井，进退两难，有很多不开心的矿工。。。 -- Well, looks like those deathclaws won't be bothering us, at least for a while I think. It's just...
