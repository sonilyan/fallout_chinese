{101}{}{这是什么地方？ -- What is this place?}
### {102}{}{Nothing, I'll be going now.}
{102}{}{没什么，我现在就去。 -- Nothing, I'll be going now.}
### {103}{}{You probably wonder why this building is so important. Well, this is my management office. I run the whole place from here. We have a storage unit to the west and an ore processing plant to the south, and of course the mine itself which is below us.}
{103}{}{你可能想知道为什么这座建筑如此重要。这是我的管理办公室。我从这里管理整个地方。我们在西边有一个储藏室，在南边有一个矿石加工厂，当然还有我们下面的矿场。 -- You probably wonder why this building is so important. Well, this is my management office. I run the whole place from here. We have a storage unit to the west and an ore processing plant to the south, and of course the mine itself which is below us.}

{108}{}{谢谢，我只想知道这些。 -- Thanks, that's all I wanted to know.}
### {109}{}{It's used to store processed materials such as coal, iron ore... anything we can dig up and make use of. So the output stays here until we sell it or use it for our needs and at the same time it's secured from dishonest hands.}
{109}{}{它用来储存加工过的材料，如煤、铁矿石……任何我们可以挖掘和利用的东西。因此，产出一直保持在这里，直到我们将其出售或用于我们的需求，同时保护它免受不诚实的人的伤害。 -- It's used to store processed materials such as coal, iron ore... anything we can dig up and make use of.
