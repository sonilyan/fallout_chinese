{113}{}{嗯。。。哦，不，不是那样的。旅途还行，但我得赶在天黑前赶到这里。 -- Hmm? ...Oh, no, not like that. The travel was fine, but I had to hurry to get here before nightfall.}
#{114}{}{I know what you mean. I'd never spend a night outside the city!}
{114}{}{我知道你的意思。我决不会在城外过夜！ -- I know what you mean. I'd never spend a night outside the city!}
#{115}{}{Yes, the wasteland can be very dangerous at night.}
{115}{}{是的，荒地在晚上很危险。 -- Yes, the wasteland can be very dangerous at night.}
#{116}{}{Ha! What, are you afraid of the dark?}
{116}{}{哈！什么，你害怕黑暗吗？ -- Ha! What, are you afraid of the dark?}

#{122}{}{Bye.}

#{123}{}{I'm not so concerned with the wasteland as I am with the people in it, to be honest. It's usually easier to "negotiate" with a gecko, if you know what I mean.}
{123}{}{老实说，我关心的不是荒地，而是荒地里的人。如果你明白我的意思的话，和壁虎“谈判”通常比较容易。 -- I'm not so concerned with the wasteland as I am with the people in it, to be honest. It's usually easier to "negotiate" with a gecko, if you know what I mean.}
#{124}{}{Are you serious?}

{128}{}{温多弗。。。哦，对了，你可能从没听说过。呃，这是盐湖附近的一个季节性狩猎村。 -- Wendover... Oh, right, you've probably never heard of it. Uh, it's a seasonal hunting village near Salt Lake.}

{134}{}{呃，我不擅长地图。如果你去过盐湖城，问问当地人。他们也许能帮你指出。 -- Eh, I'm no good with maps. If you're ever in Salt Lake, ask a local. They'll probably be able to point it out for you.}
#{135}{}{Is there anything I should know if I'm ever in Wendover?}
{135}{}{如果我在温多弗，有什么我应该知道的吗？ -- Is there anything I should know if I'm ever in Wendover?}

{137}{}{[他叹息]说来话长。你不用担心，这是我的问题。 -- [He sighs] That's a long story. You don't need to worry about it, it's my problem.}
#{138}{}{If you say so. See you around.}
{138}{}{如果你这样说。回头见。 -- If you say so. See you around.}
#{139}{}{It's mostly hunters and their families. Men hunt for geckos while women and children tend to their huts.
