#{100}{}{You see a ghoul.}
{100}{}{你看到一个僵尸。}
#{150}{}{You see Feargus.}
{150}{}{你看到费格斯了。}
#{200}{}{You see a ghoul in a robe, he's studying some blueprints.}
{200}{}{你看到一个穿着长袍的僵尸，他正在研究一些蓝图。}
#{201}{}{You see a ghoul in a robe.}
{201}{}{你看到一个穿着长袍的僵尸。}
#{250}{}{You see Feargus, who's in charge of research and development of weapons.}
{250}{}{你看费格斯，他负责武器的研发。}
#{500}{}{Are you looking for me?}
{500}{}{你在找我吗？}
#{501}{}{And who are you?}
{501}{}{你是谁？}
#{502}{}{No, don't mind me.}
{502}{}{不，别介意我。}
#{503}{}{Boohoo!}
{503}{}{呜呜！}
#{504}{}{No-no.}
{504}{}{不，不。}
#{550}{}{Oh, sorry. Name's Feargus, arms research and development.}
{550}{}{哦，对不起。我叫费格斯，武器研发。}
#{551}{}{You develop new weapons here?}
{551}{}{你在这里研发新武器？}
#{552}{}{Interesting, how did you get a job like that?}
{552}{}{有意思，你是怎么找到这样的工作的？}
#{553}{}{You have to give me an access card to the red levels.}
{553}{}{你得给我一张进入红色关卡。}
#{554}{}{Nothing that interests me. Goodbye.}
{554}{}{没什么让我感兴趣的。再见。}
#{600}{}{Well, of course not. Mostly I assemble blueprints for already existing weapons that we have, so we can produce them. But if I have original blueprints, sometimes I modify them so we can produce the weapons out of the materials and devices that we have enough of.}
{600}{}{当然不是。我主要是为我们现有的武器组装蓝图，这样我们就可以生产它们。但如果我有原始的蓝图，有时我会修改它们，这样我们就可以用足够的材料和设备生产武器。}
#{601}{}{So the Rebirth is able to produce any weapon that's acquired?}
{601}{}{所以重生可以制造任何获得的武器？}
#{602}{}{What are you working on now?}
{602}{}{你现在在做什么？}
#{603}{}{I want to know something else.}
{603}{}{我想知道些别的。}
#{604}{}{I won't keep you from your work, bye.}
{604}{}{我不会妨碍你工作的，再见。}
#{650}{}{Unfortunately not. For instance, I was successful with modifications on blueprints for a laser pistol, but weapons based on plasma discharge are too complicated, we'll never be able to produce them in this complex.}
{650}{}{不幸的是没有。例如，我成功地修改了激光手枪的设计图，但基于等离子放电的武器太复杂了，我们永远无法在这样复杂的环境中生产它们。}
#{651}{}{What are you working on now?}
{651}{}{你现在在做什么？}
#{652}{}{I'm interested in something else.}
{652}{}{我对别的东西感兴趣。}
#{653}{}{I won't keep you from your work, bye.}
{653}{}{我不会妨碍你工作的，再见。}
#{700}{}{I've just finished a few-months-long project on blueprints of an electromagnetic rifle.}
{700}{}{我刚刚完成了几个月的电磁步枪设计方案。}
#{701}{}{Tell me more about it.}
{701}{}{告诉我更多。}
#{702}{}{Have you already produced such a rifle?}
{702}{}{你已经生产出这样的步枪了吗？}
#{703}{}{Is the Rebirth able to produce any weapon that's acquired?}
{703}{}{重生能制造出任何获得的武器吗？}
#{704}{}{I'm interested in something else.}
{704}{}{我对别的东西感兴趣。}
#{705}{}{I won't keep you from your work, bye.}
{705}{}{我不会妨碍你工作的，再见。}
#{750}{}{Well, the US Army tried to produce their own electromagnetic weapons in the form of a railgun, but they weren't very successful. As opposed to one German company that focused on so-called coilguns. They produced the Gauss rifle, which propels a 2mm projectile utilizing a set of electromagnetic coils. Their prototype surpassed expectations, so the US government solved their problem by stealing its blueprints. Or at least that was their plan, they didn't obtain everything, so I had to work out the missing parts. I think I'm done, the simulations promise the same results as with the German prototype.}
{750}{}{好吧，美国军队试图生产自己的轨道炮形式的电磁武器，但他们不是很成功。而不是一家专注于所谓线圈发电机的德国公司。他们生产了高斯步枪，利用一组电磁线圈推动一枚2毫米的炮弹。他们的原型超出了预期，因此美国政府通过窃取蓝图解决了他们的问题。或者至少这是他们的计划，他们没有得到所有的东西，所以我必须找出缺失的部分。我想我完成了，模拟的结果和德国的原型一样。}
#{751}{}{Have you already produced such a rifle?}
{751}{}{你已经生产出这样的步枪了吗？}
#{752}{}{Is the Rebirth able to produce any weapon that's acquired?}
{752}{}{重生能制造出任何获得的武器吗？}
#{753}{}{I'm interested in something else.}
{753}{}{我对别的东西感兴趣。}
#{754}{}{I won't keep you from your work, bye.}
{754}{}{我不会妨碍你工作的，再见。}
#{800}{}{Not yet, I just finished the blueprints, as I mentioned. You know what? Maybe you could help me. I'd be appreciative if you took the blueprints to Chris in the workshop so he can make a prototype based on them. I don't feel like taking them to him myself. He's a good guy, it's great that he's got the enthusiasm, but he's got just a little too much of it for my taste.}
{800}{}{还没有，我刚刚完成了蓝图，就像我提到的。你知道吗？也许你能帮我。如果你能在车间里把蓝图交给克里斯，让他根据蓝图做一个原型，我会很感激的。我不想亲自带他们去见他。他是个好人，他有热情真是太好了，但他对我的口味有点过分了。}
#{801}{}{Sure, I'd be happy to help.}
{801}{}{当然，我很乐意帮忙。}
#{802}{}{Screw that, I'm not your delivery boy.}
{802}{}{去他的，我不是你的送货员。}
#{850}{}{Well, I didn't ask that much from you, but if that's how you feel, I'll take them to him myself.}
{850}{}{好吧，我没问你那么多，但如果你是这样想的，我会亲自带给他。}
#{851}{}{It's because I'm interested in something else.}
{851}{}{因为我对别的东西感兴趣。}
#{852}{}{OK, bye.}
{852}{}{好的，再见。}
#{900}{}{[He gives you the blueprints.] Thanks, I owe you one. Chris is almost always in his workshop on this level, it's easy to find him.}
{900}{}{[他给了你蓝图]谢谢，我欠你一份。克里斯几乎总是在这个级别的工作室里，很容易找到他。}
#{901}{}{Tell me something else.}
{901}{}{告诉我别的。}
#{902}{}{I'll give them to him, bye.}
{902}{}{我会给他的，再见。}
#{950}{}{It's simple, I had similar job before the war.}
{950}{}{很简单，战前我也做过类似的工作。}
#{951}{}{What exactly did you work on before the war?}
{951}{}{战前你到底在做什么？}
#{952}{}{You lived before the Great War?! Tell me something about the world back then.}
{952}{}{你生活在大战前？！告诉我一些关于那个世界的事情。}
#{953}{}{You lived before the Great War?! How did you become a ghoul?}
{953}{}{你生活在大战前？！你是怎么变成僵尸的？}
#{954}{}{I'm interested in something else.}
{954}{}{我对别的东西感兴趣。}
#{955}{}{Interesting, but I've got to go now.}
{955}{}{有意思，但我得走了。}
#{1000}{}{I don't know what to tell you. Life was completely different back then, you probably wouldn't even understand what I'm talking about. Moreover, I've forgotten a lot of things since then and some things I don't even want to remember.}
{1000}{}{我不知道该告诉你什么。那时候的生活完全不同，你可能根本不明白我在说什么。而且，从那以后我忘记了很多事情，有些事情我甚至不想记住。}
#{1001}{}{What exactly did you work on before the war?}
{1001}{}{战前你到底在做什么？}
#{1002}{}{How did you become a ghoul?}
{1002}{}{你是怎么变成僵尸的？}
#{1003}{}{I'm interested in something else.}
{1003}{}{我对别的东西感兴趣。}
#{1004}{}{Interesting, but I've got to go now.}
{1004}{}{有意思，但我得走了。}
#{1050}{}{You'll be surprised, but I don't know. I worked for the Army on some classified projects. I was a part of a big team, everybody knew only what they needed to know, so an individual didn't have a clue about the big picture.}
{1050}{}{你会惊讶的，但我不知道。我为军队做过一些机密项目。我是一个大团队的一员，每个人都只知道他们需要知道的，所以一个人对大局一无所知。}
#{1051}{}{Tell me something about the world back then.}
{1051}{}{告诉我一些关于那个世界的事情。}
#{1052}{}{How did you become a ghoul?}
{1052}{}{你是怎么变成僵尸的？}
#{1053}{}{I'm interested in something else.}
{1053}{}{我对别的东西感兴趣。}
#{1054}{}{Interesting, but I've got to go now.}
{1054}{}{有意思，但我得走了。}
#{1100}{}{I was at work when it broke out. I worked at a closely guarded military complex, and it was considered to be safe as well, but the nearby impact of a nuclear bomb showed that it wasn't. Part of the building collapsed and buried a lot of people, the rest of us got exposed to radiation that was leaking in. Most of the people were killed by it, only couple of us turned into ghouls.}
{1100}{}{事发时我正在上班。我在一个戒备森严的军事综合体工作，那里也被认为是安全的，但附近核弹的撞击表明它不是。建筑的一部分倒塌，掩埋了很多人，我们其他人暴露在泄漏进来的辐射中。大多数人都被它杀死了，只有几个人变成了僵尸。}
#{1101}{}{What did you do next?}
{1101}{}{你接下来做了什么？}
#{1102}{}{What exactly did you work on before the war?}
{1102}{}{战前你到底在做什么？}

{1104}{}{我对别的东西感兴趣。}
#{1105}{}{Interesting, but I've got to go now.}
{1105}{}{有意思，但我得走了。}
#{1150}{}{We lived inside for a couple of years, waiting to die from radiation, but it didn't happen, so we left that place. Back in those days, the world was a real wasteland, we traveled together for a long time, trying to survive. I can't say that it went well, I'm the only one that's still living.}
{1150}{}{我们在里面住了几年，等着死于核辐射，但没有发生，所以我们离开了那个地方。那时候，世界真的是一片荒原，我们一起旅行了很长时间，试图生存。我不能说一切顺利，我是唯一还活着的人。}
#{1151}{}{What exactly did you work on before the war?}
{1151}{}{战前你到底在做什么？}
#{1152}{}{Tell me something about the world back then.}

{1154}{}{有意思，但我得走了。}
#{1200}{}{What is it?}
{1200}{}{这是怎么一回事？}
#{1201}{}{Do you develop new weapons here?}
{1201}{}{你们在这里开发新武器吗？}
#{1202}{}{How did you get a job like this?}
{1202}{}{你怎么找到这样的工作的？}
#{1203}{}{You have to give me an access card to the red levels.}
{1203}{}{你得给我一张进入红色关卡。}
#{1204}{}{Nothing, really.}
{1204}{}{没什么，真的。}
#{1250}{}{Sure, I'll program it right away. What's your name, so I can check it in the system?}
{1250}{}{好的，我马上编程序。你叫什么名字，让我在系统里查一下？}
#{1251}{}{Max.}
{1251}{}{最大值。}
#{1252}{}{Actually, I don't have time now, I have to leave immediately. We'll do it some other time.}
{1252}{}{实际上，我现在没有时间，我得马上离开。我们改天再做。}
#{1300}{}{As you wish. I can program your card within a minute, but if you're in such a hurry, we'll do it some other time.}
{1300}{}{如你所愿。我可以在一分钟内给你的卡编程，但如果你这么着急，我们改天再做。}
#{1301}{}{OK, bye.}
{1301}{}{好的，再见。}
#{1350}{}{OK, hold on a second. [He looks at the computer screen.] That's odd, it seems that your authorization wasn't approved, and what's more, you're not registered for a long enough time. I'll need to check it with Leonard.}
{1350}{}{好的，等一下。[他看了看电脑屏幕]真奇怪，你的授权似乎没有被批准，而且你的注册时间还不够长。我要和伦纳德核对一下。}
#{1351}{}{Damn, Leonard mentioned that he's got some problems with the computer, this must be a result of it. I'll get it fixed immediately, don't worry about it.}
{1351}{}{该死，莱纳德说他电脑出了点问题，这一定是结果。我马上把它修好，别担心。}
#{1352}{}{I'd rather leave now...}
{1352}{}{我宁愿现在就走。。。}
#{1400}{}{Hold on, this has to be cleared up. Where are you going? [He activates the alarm.]}
{1400}{}{等等，这件事必须解决。你要去哪里？[他启动了警报。]}
#{1401}{}{Dammit!}
{1401}{}{该死！}
#{1450}{}{Well, fine, as long as I'm not the one fixing the problems... Come back when your records are straightened out.}
{1450}{}{好吧，只要我不是解决问题的人。。。等你的记录整理好再回来。}
#{1451}{}{OK, bye.}
{1451}{}{好的，再见。}
