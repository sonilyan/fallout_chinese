{100}{}{Hello.}
{101}{}{You want something?}
{102}{}{Where's the fire?}
{103}{}{Do you work here?}
{104}{}{You're new here, right?}
{105}{}{Are you always bothering people like this?}
{106}{}{I must get back to work.}
#
{107}{}{Wh... Who are you? What do you want?}
{108}{}{I work for chief Brian, that's all you have to know. I've got some questions for you.}
{109}{}{I'm... out of here.}
#questions...
{110}{}{Everybody here works for Brian. Questions... what questions? Can't I have peace just for one moment. Oh
 well... ask what you want.}
{111}{}{What do you do here?}
{112}{}{Actually, I don't need to ask you anything right now.}
#between lines 108 and 109
{113}{}{I'm new here and I just wanted to get familiar with somebody.}
# answer after 108
{114}{}{I'm responsible for cleaning, collecting garbage, and stuff.}
{115}{}{Thanks. Let me ask you something else.}
#
{116}{}{New guy, nice to have you here. People call me Chris. I'm the only one who can get anything you need.
 So, if you want some stuff, talk to me. Right?}
{117}{}{Sure thing. Can you get some strong stuff, to keep me high but not too much?}
{118}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
#
{119}{}{Like I said, anything you need. Most of that stuff is legal everywhere else but that bastard Brian completely
 cut off the supplies, even if half of the population is addicted to it. There will be trouble if these people don't get what
 they paid for, sooner than he thinks.}
{120}{}{Sounds bad. How's the situation?}
{121}{}{I think he's right. But first he should prevent people from selling that shit.}
#how is the situation?
{122}{}{It's terrible! Brian ordered more inspections which affected my business... and it's getting worse. I have to
 find another way to bring some stuff down here before we run out of it, or we're screwed!}
{123}{}{What are you going to do?}
#
{124}{}{Why do you suddenly care? You have been in this town for, what, five minutes and you already feel sad. I
 don't buy that crap! You are no better than these addicts that buy drugs from me. Look how desperate they are. Jet
 became their whole life...}
{125}{}{And I'm here to change that, you monster!}
#
{126}{}{You... to change!? Just being here makes you a loser. I remember a man who wanted to change things,
 Charles. Yep... but he choose the wrong way to do it. He thought that stealing money from Brian was going to pass
 unnoticed. He was too clumsy for his own good so I had to take over his work, and his money of course. It would be
 such a shame to spent it like he did, giving it to the poor...}
{127}{}{You took his money, and what about his life?}
#
{128}{}{I don't think I remember what happened to him. I'm going now, don't try to follow me!}
{129}{}{Where are you going...}
#
{130}{}{Stop there! Don't come any closer!}
{131}{}{I killed Charles and I'm not going to give up. This is going to end now!}
{132}{}{I'm coming, oh mighty one!}
#dude meet him again
{133}{}{You again, can I get you something?}
#
{134}{}{Sure thing, what do you need?}
{135}{}{Can you get me something strong, to keep me in a good mood?}
{136}{}{Nothing at the moment.}
