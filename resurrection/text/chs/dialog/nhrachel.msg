{556}{}{其实没什么。再见，瑞秋。}
#{600}{}{Of course he did! That good-for-nothing lazy ass! He'll do anything just to avoid me. [Rachel throws an angry glance at Greg.] When some loser gets stung by a radscorpion, he suddenly has all the time in the world, but for his wife? Never! Oh, he'll pay for this! He'll regret neglecting me like this!}
{600}{}{他当然做了！那个没用的懒汉！他会做任何事来躲避我。[雷切尔愤怒地瞥了格雷格一眼]当一个失败者被蝎子蜇伤时，他突然拥有了世界上所有的时间，但他的妻子呢？从未！哦，他会为此付出代价的！他会后悔这样忽视我的！}
#{601}{}{Yeah, sure. Look, do you need help or not?}

#{604}{}{Uhm, I gotta go now. See ya later.}
{604}{}{嗯，我得走了。再见。}
#{650}{}{You bet I do! Don't interrupt me! One word and my husband will never treat you again. He'll let you bleed out, if I tell him to. Do you understand?}
{650}{}{我当然知道！别打断我！一句话，我丈夫就再也不会对你了。如果我告诉他，他会让你流血的。你明白吗？}
#{651}{}{Ehm, sure. Please continue.}
{651}{}{嗯，当然。请继续。}
#{652}{}{I've had enough. Spell out what you want, or shut the hell up!}
{652}{}{我受够了。说清楚你想要什么，否则就闭嘴！}
#{653}{}{Sorry, but I have to go now. Goodbye.}
{653}{}{对不起，我得走了。再见。}
#{700}{}{That's better. It's a very important issue. My beautiful necklace is gone. It's extremely valuable. A lot of locals envied it. One of them definitely stole it! You must find the thief and beat the necklace out of them!}
{700}{}{这样更好。这是一个非常重要的问题。我漂亮的项链不见了。非常珍贵。很多当地人羡慕它。其中一个肯定偷了！你必须找到小偷，把他们的项链打出来！}

#{705}{}{[Show her the necklace.] Is this it? You're never gonna believe who had it.}
{705}{}{[给她看项链]是这个吗？你永远不会相信是谁干的。}
#{750}{}{Certainly not! I looked everywhere. Do you think I'm stupid?!}
{750}{}{当然不是！我到处找。你觉得我傻吗？！}
#{751}{}{Just asking. OK, I'll look for it.}
{751}{}{只是问问而已。好的，我去找。}
#{752}{}{Just asking. I have to go now.}
{752}{}{只是问问而已。我得走了。}
#{753}{}{Maybe you just missed a spot. That sometimes happens.}
{753}{}{也许你错过了一个位置。这种情况有时会发生。}
#{775}{}{Wasn't I clear the first time?! I looked everywhere! There is absolutely no way that it's still here. Do you understand?!}
{775}{}{我第一次不是很清楚吗？！我到处找了！绝对不可能它还在这里。你明白吗？！}
#{776}{}{Eh, yes. But... Please look one more time. Just to be sure.}
{776}{}{嗯，是的。但是。。。请再看一遍。只是想确定一下。}
#{800}{}{[Rachel frowns.] Never in my life have I met someone so annoyingly stubborn! Fine! I'll look one more time, but afterwards you have to finally leave me alone. [She huffs and starts looking through her things. Suddenly she stops.] It's here. That's... This could happen to anyone!}
{800}{}{[瑞秋皱眉]我这辈子从没见过这么顽固的人！好的！我再看一次，但之后你总得让我一个人呆着。[她怒气冲冲地开始翻看她的东西。突然她停了下来。]它来了。那是。。。这可能发生在任何人身上！}
#{801}{}{I'm sure it could. Next time, please be more careful. Goodbye.}
{801}{}{我肯定会的。下次，请多加小心。再见。}
#{900}{}{No one talks to me like that! Get out and never come back! And forget about any more treatment! My husband won't even look at you!}
{900}{}{没人那样跟我说话！出去，再也不要回来！别再想治疗了！我丈夫甚至不看你一眼！}
#{901}{}{Whatever.}
{901}{}{无论什么。}
#{902}{}{You went too far. Time to die, bitch!}
{902}{}{你太过分了。该死了，婊子！}
#{950}{}{[She snatches it out of your hand.] It is! Tell me, where was it?}
{950}{}{[她从你手里夺过来]是的！告诉我，它在哪里？}
#{951}{}{Some corpse in the cave had it. He was probably trying to hide it, when radscorpions surprised him.}
{951}{}{山洞里有具尸体。他可能是想把它藏起来，这时蝎子吓了他一跳。}
#{1000}{}{[Rachel thinks for a while.] That must have been that Oswald's rascal! He disappeared some time ago. Suits him right, that thieving bastard! He's always been just trouble.}
{1000}{}{[雷切尔想了一会儿]那一定是奥斯瓦尔德的流氓！他不久前失踪了。很适合他，那个偷东西的混蛋！他总是惹麻烦。}
#{1001}{}{Whatever you say. Goodbye.}
{1001}{}{不管你说什么。再见。}
#{1200}{}{[She snatches it out of your hand.] Do tell.}
{1200}{}{[她从你手里夺走了它]告诉我。}
#{1201}{}{It was Oswald's son, Tommy. He wanted to hide it in the cave, but he was surprised by radscorpions. He's dead now.}
{1201}{}{是奥斯瓦尔德的儿子汤米。他想把它藏在山洞里，但被蝎子吓了一跳。他现在死了。}
#{1400}{}{I suspected it could be him. He's always been trouble. That thieving bastard got what he deserved.}
{1400}{}{我怀疑可能是他。他总是惹麻烦。那个偷东西的混蛋罪有应得。}
#{1401}{}{You might also want to know that Oswald tried to bribe me to hide it from everyone.}
{1401}{}{你可能还想知道奥斯瓦尔德试图贿赂我，向所有人隐瞒真相。}
#{1402}{}{You might also want to know that Oswald tried to bribe me to hide it from everyone.}
{1402}{}{你可能还想知道奥斯瓦尔德试图贿赂我，向所有人隐瞒真相。}
#{1403}{}{Whatever you say. Goodbye.}
{1403}{}{不管你说什么。再见。}
#{1450}{}{That pathetic loser! As if what his son did wasn't enough. Oh, he's going to regret this!}
{1450}{}{那个可怜的失败者！好像他儿子做的还不够。哦，他会后悔的！}
#{1451}{}{That's a bit too much. Goodbye.}
{1451}{}{太过分了。再见。}
#{1452}{}{Make him suffer. See you, Rachel.}
