{350}{}{你已经知道你需要的一切了。}
### {351}{}{I respect your interest in our teaching. But not everyone can comprehend it.}
{351}{}{我尊重你对我们教学的兴趣。但并不是每个人都能理解。}
### {352}{}{[Next]}
{352}{}{[下一个]}
### {353}{}{Our church calls to accept the Sacred Fire as an act of healing, as a chance to start life anew. After all, instead of rebirth, people are still waging a senseless struggle among themselves.}
{353}{}{我们的教会呼吁接受圣火作为一种疗愈行为，作为一个重新开始生活的机会。毕竟，人们非但没有重生，反而还在进行无谓的斗争。}
### {354}{}{What is this Sacred Fire?}
{354}{}{这是什么圣火？}
### {355}{}{Now everything is clear, you don't have to continue.}
{355}{}{现在一切都清楚了，你不必继续了。}
### {356}{}{The fire that incinerated the world a hundred years ago. We call it sacred because it punished fallen humanity and cleansed the earth of filth, thereby giving descendants the opportunity to live a new life.}
{356}{}{一百年前烧毁世界的大火。我们称之为神圣，因为它惩罚了堕落的人类，净化了地球上的污秽，从而给子孙后代过上新生活的机会。}
### {357}{}{Wasn't it some kind of powerful weapon?}
{357}{}{这不是某种强大的武器吗？}
### {358}{}{Technically, yes. But it doesn't matter. For the Lord has punished people with their own hands. The layman sees a nuclear bomb as a nuclear bomb, but we see God's plan in it.}
{358}{}{从技术上讲，是的。但这并不重要。因为主已经用自己的手惩罚了人们。外行人把核弹看作核弹，但我们从中看到了上帝的计划。}
### {359}{}{You said "live anew." So the church is trying to change the world?}
{359}{}{你说“重新生活”所以教会试图改变世界？}
### {360}{}{By uniting and rallying the lands for the benefit of a common goal of survival. To do this, it is necessary to return and rethink ancient technologies, revive nuclear energy and teach people to read and write.}
{360}{}{为了共同的生存目标，团结和统一土地。要做到这一点，就必须回归和重新思考古老的技术，复兴核能，教人们读书写字。}
### {361}{}{So do you force others to your faith?}
{361}{}{那么你强迫别人相信你的信仰吗？}
### {362}{}{No, no. Such novices would be to the detriment of the church. Joining the abbey must be voluntary. In addition, we are very careful in accepting people into the service, every member of the church needs a guarantor.}
{362}{}{不，不。这样的新手会对教会不利。加入修道院必须是自愿的。此外，我们在接受人们参加礼拜时非常谨慎，教会的每个成员都需要一个担保人。}
### {363}{}{What does "unite the lands" mean?}
{363}{}{“统一土地”是什么意思？}
### {364}{}{One banner, one country, one people... one faith. People should abandon all internecine conflicts and give themselves up to Rebirth in full.}
{364}{}{一面旗帜，一个国家，一个人民...一个信仰。人们应该抛弃一切自相残杀的冲突，全身心地投入到重生中去。}
### {365}{}{And how far has the church spread?}
{365}{}{教会传播了多远？}
### {366}{}{We have chapels in the Phoenix area and in several neighboring cities. By modern standards, this is a huge territory. But we still have room to grow.}
{366}{}{我们在凤凰城地区和邻近的几个城市都有小教堂。按照现代标准，这是一个巨大的领域。但我们还有成长的空间。}
### {367}{}{Now I understand how the church is connected with the slavers.}
{367}{}{现在我明白了教会是如何与奴隶主联系在一起的。}
### {368}{}{You are fighting yourself. Aren't you considered a tyrant who usurped power?}
{368}{}{你在和自己打架。你不被认为是篡权的暴君吗？}

### {370}{}{The ordinary population has fallen to the level of animals and is not able to participate in the great work of Rebirth voluntarily. Slavery is only a necessary and temporary means for our mission. Besides, we have never enslaved anyone ourselves, but only paid mercenaries for their work, turning a blind eye to their wild measures.}
{370}{}{普通人群已经沦为动物级别，无法自愿参与《重生》的伟大工作。奴隶制只是我们使命的一种必要和暂时的手段。此外，我们自己从未奴役过任何人，只为雇佣兵的工作支付报酬，对他们的野蛮行径视而不见。}
### {371}{}{Sounds inspiring. Can I join your cult?}
{371}{}{听起来很鼓舞人心。我可以加入你的邪教吗？}
### {372}{}{That's enough! Such a religion has no place in our world. I will destroy you all.}
{372}{}{够了！这样的宗教在我们的世界上没有立足之地。我要毁灭你们所有人。}
### {373}{}{Thanks for the conversation, now I understand a lot more.}
{373}{}{谢谢你的谈话，现在我明白多了。}
### {374}{}{By the way, aren't you behind the abduction of the peasants of the Villa?}
{374}{}{顺便问一下，你不是绑架别墅农民的幕后黑手吗？}
### {375}{}{By the way, about the abduction of the peasants of the Villa.}
{375}{}{顺便说一下，关于别墅农民被绑架的事。}

### {380}{}{Are you the one who manages this whole process?}
{380}{}{你是管理整个过程的人吗？}
### {381}{}{Of course.}
{381}{}{当然}
### {382}{}{So you can explain to me the essence of your religion better than others.}
{382}{}{所以你可以比其他人更好地向我解释你的宗教本质。}
### {383}{}{Nice to meet you. Nothing else interested me.}
{383}{}{很高兴认识你。没有别的东西让我感兴趣。}
### {384}{}{The people consider you a tyrant. Do you know about this?}
{384}{}{人们认为你是暴君。你知道这件事吗？}
### {385}{}{Evil tongues. Apparently, such a reputation was fixed for the church after the revolution. Yes, we came to power by force. It was a forced measure. But there has always been peace in our hearts.}
{385}{}{恶毒的舌头。显然，这样的名声是在革命后为教会建立起来的。是的，我们是靠武力上台的。这是一项强制性措施。但是，我们的心中始终是和平的。}
### {386}{}{I got the impression that the cult owns this city...}
{386}{}{我得到的印象是邪教拥有这座城市...}
### {387}{}{The church has really become something big for Phoenix. Science, education and medicine have returned to the city from our submission. We have introduced a cap currency and are establishing trade relations. Thanks to us, crime has decreased in the city. But the bulk of the townspeople live outside of our attention.}
{387}{}{教堂对凤凰城来说真的很重要。科学、教育和医学已经从我们提交的材料中回到了这个城市。我们已经引入了上限货币，并正在建立贸易关系。多亏了我们，这个城市的犯罪率下降了。但大部分市民都生活在我们关注之外。}
### {388}{}{Wow, that's a twist. I want to know more about your religion.}
{388}{}{哇，真奇怪。我想更多地了解你的宗教信仰。}
### {389}{}{No matter how much you hide behind beautiful words, and you are an ordinary tyrant. And I will kill you so that others will not be offended.}

### {390}{}{I'm afraid I have to go. My respects, Mr. Aaron.}
{390}{}{恐怕我得走了。我的敬意，亚伦先生。}
### {391}{}{You look more like a tyrant than an abbot.}
{391}{}{你看起来更像暴君而不是方丈。}
### {392}{}{The Church had to take over the management of this city. This is a necessary measure until society is ready to create a full-fledged city hall and police.}
{392}{}{教会不得不接管这座城市的管理权。在社会准备建立一个全面的市政厅和警察之前，这是一项必要的措施。}

#Villa
### {400}{}{I want to talk to you about the Villa.}

{403}{}{我想我们已经讨论过了。再见，亚伦先生。}
### {404}{}{Hmm... Villa... Is this some kind of village? I've never heard of her.}
{404}{}{嗯…别墅...这是什么村庄吗？我从没听说过她。}
### {405}{}{I'm actually looking for my relatives. They were enslaved.}
{405}{}{实际上我在找我的亲戚。他们被奴役了。}
### {406}{}{Oh, poor people. I have infinite sympathy for you and will pray for the salvation of your souls. But why did your search lead you to us?}
{406}{}{哦，可怜的人。我对你深表同情，并将为你灵魂的救赎祈祷。但为什么你的搜索会把你带到我们这里？}
### {407}{}{Your sect is clearly involved in this! Bring back my relatives!}
{407}{}{你的教派显然与此事有关！把我的亲人带回来！}
### {408}{}{That wasn't very kind of you. We are just a peaceful church, we do not enslave anyone.}
{408}{}{你不是很好。我们只是一个和平的教会，我们不奴役任何人。}
### {409}{}{You're lying.}
{409}{}{你在撒谎。}
### {410}{}{Well, it's sad to see such wild ignorance. I have to... (one of the advisers interrupts the Ruler and whispers something in his ear) That's it. So do you want to be reunited with your family? We can provide it.}
{410}{}{看到如此疯狂的无知真是令人难过。我必须…（其中一位顾问打断了统治者的话，在他耳边低语）就这样。你想和家人团聚吗？我们可以提供。}
### {411}{}{Really? In what way?}
{411}{}{真正地以什么方式？}
### {412}{}{Lay down your weapons and raise your hands. Don't try to resist. You will be sent to hard labor, to the rest of your tribesmen.}
{412}{}{放下武器，举起双手。不要试图抗拒。你将被送到艰苦的劳动，你的部落的其他人。}
### {413}{}{Well, if it helps to find relatives, I voluntarily give myself into slavery.}
{413}{}{好吧，如果这有助于找到亲人，我会自愿把自己变成奴隶。}
### {414}{}{You can't intimidate me. I will leave here the same way I entered.}
{414}{}{你不能恐吓我。我会像进去一样离开这里。}
### {1414}{}{You can't intimidate me. I will leave here the same way I entered.}
{1414}{}{你不能恐吓我。我会像进去一样离开这里。}
### {415}{}{It's a pity that it came to this. Grab him!}
{415}{}{遗憾的是，事情发展到这个地步。抓住他！}
### {1415}{}{It's a pity that it came to this. Grab her!}
{1415}{}{遗憾的是，事情发展到这个地步。抓住她！}
### {416}{}{Your words sound more insignificant than the moan of an atom in a fiery cloud. Send him to our brothers in Two-Sun, let him serve the Sacred Fire.}
{416}{}{你的话听起来比火焰云中原子的呻吟更微不足道。把他送到我们两个太阳的兄弟那里，让他为圣火服务。}
### {1416}{}{Your words sound more insignificant than the moan of an atom in a fiery cloud. Send her to our brothers in Two-Sun, let her serve the Sacred Fire.}
{1416}{}{你的话听起来比火焰云中原子的呻吟更微不足道。把她送到我们两个太阳的兄弟那里，让她为圣火服务。}
### {417}{}{(one of the councillors interrupts the Ruler and whispers something in his ear) Hmm. Looks like I'm going to have to let you go. But for the future, remember that no one will go unpunished if they go against the Church of the Sacred Fire.}
{417}{}{（其中一位议员打断了统治者的话，在他耳边低语）嗯。看来我得让你走了。但对于未来，请记住，如果任何人反对拜火教，他们都不会逍遥法外。}
### {418}{}{Okay, I'll remember that.}
{418}{}{好吧，我会记住的。}
### {419}{}{Just tell me what to do.}
{419}{}{告诉我该怎么办。}
### {420}{}{I thought you knew everything here.}
{420}{}{我以为你知道这里的一切。}
### {421}{}{Alas, this is not the case.}
{421}{}{唉，事实并非如此。}
### {422}{}{Well, sorry. I think I'll go look further...}
{422}{}{对不起。我想我会再往下看...}
### {423}{}{Wait, I'm not going to resist.}
{423}{}{等等，我不会反抗的。}
### {424}{}{As a member of the Brotherhood of Steel, I count on assistance in finding the missing peasants.}
{424}{}{作为钢铁兄弟会的一员，我指望得到援助来寻找失踪的农民。}
### {425}{}{It is strange that the Brotherhood of Steel became interested in these peasants. Of course we will help you.}
{425}{}{奇怪的是，钢铁兄弟会对这些农民产生了兴趣。我们当然会帮你的。}
### {426}{}{So what do you know about this case?}
{426}{}{那么你对这个案子了解多少？}
### {427}{}{You're lying. I'm not leaving until I know the whole truth.}
{427}{}{你在撒谎。在我知道全部真相之前我不会离开。}
### {428}{}{Everyone stop! Don't come near! I will defend myself!}
{428}{}{大家停下！不要靠近！我会自卫的！}
### {429}{}{No one here will touch me. Got it?}
{429}{}{这里没有人会碰我，明白了吗？}

### {430}{}{Enough of these representations. I KNOW that this church sponsored a slave convoy.}
{430}{}{这些表述已经够多了。我知道这个教堂赞助了一个奴隶车队。}
### {431}{}{Your audacity knows no bounds.}
{431}{}{你的大胆是无止境的。}
### {432}{}{I'm not leaving until I know what's going on.}

{433}{}{和平地去吧，钢铁兄弟会的使者。}
### {434}{}{My respects.}
{434}{}{我的敬意。}
### {435}{}{Are you pretending to be kind? I'll keep that in mind.}
{435}{}{你在假装善良吗？我会记住的。}

### {436}{}{Who dared to lay a hand on your family? I will not tolerate such an attitude towards my bishop!}
{436}{}{谁敢干涉你的家人？我不会容忍对我的主教这样的态度！}
### {437}{}{That's what I want to know. Will you help me?}
{437}{}{这就是我想知道的。你能帮我吗？}
### {438}{}{ (gives a sign to the scribe, who searches for something in the computer and then whispers the result) I'm sorry, but your relatives have already gone to work in the sacred mines in the south.}
{438}{}{（给抄写员一个手势，他在电脑里搜索了一些东西，然后悄悄说出了结果）对不起，你的亲戚已经去了南方的神圣矿井工作了。}

### {450}{}{Hmm. Remind me, what is the name of this village? (one of the councillors approaches the Ruler and whispers something in his ear) Umgu... Yes, we know where your people are. They got a second chance and are now working out their karma in the south.}
{450}{}{嗯。提醒我，这个村子叫什么名字？（其中一名议员走近统治者，在他耳边低语）乌姆古...是的，我们知道你们的人在哪里。他们得到了第二次机会，现在正在南方解决他们的因果报应。}
### {452}{}{I remember our conversation. The peasants got a second chance and are working off their karma in the south.}
{452}{}{我记得我们的谈话。农民们得到了第二次机会，正在南方解决他们的因果报应。}
### {453}{}{In the south? And where exactly?}
{453}{}{在南方？具体在哪里？}
### {454}{}{Some of them were left in Flagstaff to work in the mines. The rest were sent to Two-Sun to serve for the benefit of Progress. Local tinsmiths do not have enough workers to work on protected lands. Such a fate is honorable, because these slaves will help the whole world with their sacrifice.}
{454}{}{他们中的一些人被留在弗拉格斯塔夫去矿山工作。其余的则被派往两个太阳，为进步号服务。当地的锡匠没有足够的工人在受保护的土地上工作。这样的命运是光荣的，因为这些奴隶将用他们的牺牲来帮助整个世界。}
### {459}{}{Why these unnecessary questions? During your subordination, you were given the opportunity to get to know the tinsmiths better. This tribe reveres ancient technologies, although it sees them in a very narrow light.}
{459}{}{为什么这些不必要的问题？在你的从属关系中，你有机会更好地了解锡匠。这个部落尊重古老的技术，尽管他们对这些技术的看法非常狭隘。}
### {460}{}{Who are these tinsmiths?}
{460}{}{这些锡匠是谁？}
### {461}{}{An occult tribe of admirers of ancient technologies. Like us, they advocate the revival of the ancient world, but they see it exclusively in a technological way. Now we have common goals with them, but someday misunderstanding will become a conflict.}
{461}{}{古代科技崇拜者的神秘部落。和我们一样，他们主张复兴古代世界，但他们完全以技术的方式看待它。现在我们和他们有共同的目标，但总有一天误解会变成冲突。}
### {462}{}{What do you care about their technologies?}
{462}{}{你关心他们的技术是什么？}
### {463}{}{Without the production base of tinsmiths, we will not even be able to conduct electricity in this cathedral. We need their machines and skills.}
{463}{}{如果没有锡匠的生产基地，我们甚至无法在这座大教堂里导电。我们需要他们的机器和技能。}
### {464}{}{Yes, you both need to be eliminated. And we need to start with this pitiful godless cathedral.}
{464}{}{是的，你们两个都需要被淘汰。我们需要从这座可怜的无神大教堂开始。}
### {465}{}{That explains everything. I have no more questions.}
{465}{}{这说明了一切。我没有更多的问题了。}
### {466}{}{The prison in Flagstaff is also your handiwork?}
{466}{}{弗拉格斯塔夫的监狱也是你的杰作？}
### {467}{}{The Flagstaff colony was created on our bottlecaps. But over time it became more and more free and independent.}
{467}{}{弗拉格斯塔夫殖民地是在我们的瓶子上建立的。但随着时间的推移，它变得越来越自由和独立。}
### {468}{}{Why do you need this colony?}
{468}{}{你为什么需要这个殖民地？}
### {469}{}{Obviously, for the production of uranium in local mines.}
{469}{}{显然，是为了在当地矿山生产铀。}
### {470}{}{But why does the church need uranium ore?}
{470}{}{但教会为什么需要铀矿呢？}
### {471}{}{Uranium is necessary for the production of nuclear energy. After all, it is impossible to use old technologies without it. And without them, there can be no question of any revival of civilization.}
{471}{}{铀是生产核能所必需的。毕竟，没有它就不可能使用旧技术。没有它们，就不可能有任何文明复兴的问题。}
### {472}{}{Does Faber cause you any problems?}
{472}{}{费伯会给你带来什么问题吗？}
### {473}{}{Is Faber starting to step on his heels?}
{473}{}{费伯开始踩他的脚跟了吗？}
### {474}{}{In a way. Sometimes you eat a mole rat, and sometimes he eats you. Faber shares many of our views, but sees them in his own way. This sometimes creates small conflicts.}
{474}{}{在某种程度上有时你吃鼹鼠，有时他吃你。费伯赞同我们的许多观点，但他以自己的方式看待这些观点。这有时会产生小冲突。}
#- Quote from the movie "The Big Lebowski": Sometimes you eat a bear, and sometimes he eats you.
### {475}{}{Great. Then I will follow his example and seize power over this defenseless cathedral.}
{475}{}{太棒了然后我将效仿他的做法，夺取这座毫无防御能力的大教堂的权力。}
### {476}{}{I think I should go to Flagstaff and find out everything in the first person. Goodbye.}
{476}{}{我想我应该去弗拉格斯塔夫，以第一人称了解一切。再见}
### {477}{}{In a way. Allowing people to power, you always risk making an enemy out of a friend. However, it became known that Faber was no longer in business. It is unclear whether he was killed by accident or this is a cunning plan of the local revolution. We are still dealing with this problem.}
{477}{}{在某种程度上允许人们掌权，你总是冒着把朋友变成敌人的风险。然而，大家都知道费伯已经不在做生意了。目前尚不清楚他是意外身亡，还是这是当地革命的一个狡猾计划。我们仍在处理这个问题。}
### {478}{}{And what did you say about tinsmiths?}
{478}{}{你怎么说锡匠？}

### {480}{}{I've had enough of this lie. I'm leaving here.}
{480}{}{我受够了这个谎言。我要离开这里。}
### {481}{}{It looks like you have big plans. Now I can leave here with peace of mind.}
{481}{}{看起来你有大计划。现在我可以放心地离开这里了。}
### {482}{}{But why do you patronize slavery?}
{482}{}{但你为什么光顾奴隶制？}
### {483}{}{Is that why you patronize slavery?}
{483}{}{这就是你支持奴隶制的原因吗？}
### {484}{}{Society is not ready to be independent. These people will never rise from their knees on their own. They need tyrants and guides.}
{484}{}{社会还没有做好独立的准备。这些人永远不会自立。他们需要暴君和向导。}
### {485}{}{So it is you who are guilty of enslaving the Villa?}
{485}{}{那么是你犯了奴役别墅的罪？}
### {486}{}{Don't rush into accusations. We only sponsor our colonies and various projects with caps. And if slave power is needed to provide them, then the caps will be used to buy slaves.}
{486}{}{不要急于指责。我们只赞助我们的殖民地和各种有上限的项目。如果需要奴隶的力量来提供它们，那么这些上限将被用来购买奴隶。}
### {487}{}{It's a disgrace to the church. You should disappear.}
{487}{}{这是教会的耻辱。你应该消失。}
### {488}{}{An interesting point of view. Although it is unlikely to take root with us.}
{488}{}{一个有趣的观点。尽管它不太可能与我们一起扎根。}
### {489}{}{Coercion is the worst method of development of society.}
{489}{}{强制是社会发展最糟糕的方法。}
### {490}{}{Oh, you're wrong. Society is not ready to be independent. He needs tyrants and guides.}
{490}{}{哦，你错了。社会还没有做好独立的准备。他需要暴君和向导。}
### {491}{}{And what does this have to do with the tinsmiths in Two-Sun?}
{491}{}{这和《两个太阳》中的锡匠有什么关系？}
### {492}{}{Now it's clear what you have to do with the Flagstaff jailers.}
{492}{}{现在很清楚你该怎么处理弗拉格斯塔夫监狱的人了。}

#Become A Follower
### {500}{}{I'm thinking of joining your church.}
{500}{}{我想加入你们的教会。}
### {501}{}{It's not as easy as you think. To be accepted for service, a guarantor or some merit significant for our mission is required. What can you say to that?}
{501}{}{这并不像你想象的那么容易。要被接受服役，需要一名担保人或一些对我们的使命有重要意义的功绩。对此你能说什么？}

### {503}{}{Our church is constantly under attack. Prove that we can trust you - and then we'll talk about your dedication.}

{510}{}{好的，我要找一个担保人。}
### {511}{}{But I really want to join your church.}
{511}{}{但我真的很想加入你们的教会。}
### {512}{}{A guarantor is required for admission to the service... But I doubt the purity of your thoughts, peasant from the Villa.}
{512}{}{接受服务需要有担保人...但我怀疑你思想的纯洁性，别墅里的农民。}
### {1512}{}{A guarantor is required for admission to the service... But I doubt the purity of your thoughts, peasant woman from the Villa.}

### {515}{}{Here is a letter of recommendation from a preacher from Flagstaff.}
{515}{}{这是弗拉格斯塔夫一位传教士的推荐信。}
### {516}{}{(listens to the whisper of the adviser) This letter doesn't mean anything anymore. Get out.}
{516}{}{（听顾问低声说）这封信已经没有任何意义了。滚出去。}

{517}{}{嗯，但是...}
### {518}{}{I had a letter of recommendation from Flagstaff. But it's gone somewhere.}

{530}{}{在这种情况下，我很高兴看到你在智慧和进步的居所。我们的教会正在努力让世界从大战的创伤中恢复过来。你们将帮助我们完成这项艰巨的任务。}
### {531}{}{Great. What can I do for the church?}
{531}{}{太棒了我能为教堂做些什么？}
### {532}{}{I hope it makes no sense to explain that the church has many enemies. The hostility has intensified recently. Several novices were killed right on the streets of the city in full view of everyone. I ask you to investigate these crimes.}
{532}{}{我希望解释教会有很多敌人是没有意义的。敌意最近加剧了。几个新手在众目睽睽之下在城市的街道上被杀。我请求你们调查这些罪行。}

{533}{}{攻击者选错了目标。但我该从哪里开始呢？}

### {535}{}{I will return when the issue is resolved.}
{535}{}{问题解决后我会回来的。}
### {536}{}{I'll do my best.}
{536}{}{我会尽力的。}

#The first quest
### {550}{}{About those crimes against the church.}
{550}{}{关于那些针对教会的罪行。}
### {551}{}{Did you find out anything?}
{551}{}{你发现什么了吗？}
### {552}{}{Unfortunately, nothing. This case is too dark.}
{552}{}{不幸的是，什么都没有。这个箱子太黑了。}
### {553}{}{Sorry to hear that. But I'm not giving up hope. Talk to Gabriel at the city gate, he will tell you the details of the attacks.}
{553}{}{很抱歉听到这个消息。但我并没有放弃希望。在城门与加布里埃尔交谈，他会告诉你袭击的细节。}
### {554}{}{Okay, I'll go.}
{554}{}{好的，我走。}
### {555}{}{It looks like you've made some serious enemies. They are well organized and well equipped. More importantly, they're watching you.}
{555}{}{看起来你已经树敌了。他们组织严密，装备精良。更重要的是，他们在监视你。}
### {556}{}{Are you saying these attacks weren't spontaneous? That someone was watching the novices and preparing for an attack in advance?}
{556}{}{你是说这些袭击不是自发的吗？有人在监视新手并提前准备进攻？}
### {557}{}{That's right.}
{557}{}{没错。}
### {558}{}{(pursing his lips in thought, approaches the altar) Probably it is. But no one outside the cathedral knows our routines. The novices' schedule is drawn up for the whole week. If the attackers, as you say, were preparing for an attack, then how did they find out about these plans?}
{558}{}{（若有所思地抿着嘴，走近祭坛）也许是这样。但大教堂外没有人知道我们的日常生活。新手们制定了一整周的时间表。如果袭击者，正如你所说，正在为袭击做准备，那么他们是如何发现这些计划的？}
### {559}{}{Who has access to the schedule?}
{559}{}{谁有权访问时间表？}
### {560}{}{Each abbot draws up a schedule of his novices and passes it to the library. Only a few people have access to the general list.}
{560}{}{每位住持都会为他的新手制定一份时间表，并将其交给图书馆。只有少数人可以访问一般列表。}
### {561}{}{It looks like it's time for me to visit this storehouse of old books. Let me take my leave.}
{561}{}{看来是我参观这个旧书仓库的时候了。让我走吧。}
### {562}{}{Okay, so be it, I'll go there and find out.}
{562}{}{好吧，就这样吧，我去那里看看。}
### {563}{}{Well, I don't know. It could be true...}
{563}{}{嗯，我不知道。这可能是真的...}

### {570}{}{The spy turned out to be Mathias. He followed the novices' routine and transmitted the data through the radio station to the enemies of the church.}
{570}{}{那个间谍原来是马蒂亚斯。他按照新手的惯例，通过电台将数据传输给教会的敌人。}
### {571}{}{ (Aaron's lips turn red with anger) Mathias... I should have guessed sooner. How could one of my closest advisers betray me? Guards! Mathias is under arrest.}
{571}{}{（亚伦气得嘴唇都红了）马蒂亚斯...我应该早点猜出来。我最亲密的顾问怎么会背叛我？卫兵！马蒂亚斯被捕了。}
### {572}{}{Be polite to this respectable man.}
{572}{}{对这个受人尊敬的人要有礼貌。}
### {573}{}{Right. And fry his eggs with a shocker.}
{573}{}{正确的然后用电击器煎鸡蛋。}
### {574}{}{ (wandering around the hall in thought) There is a solid deception all around... I can't even trust my closest subordinates. No one could have thought that Mathias hated the state of things in the church so much.}
{574}{}{（在大厅里徘徊思考）周围有一个坚实的骗局...我甚至不能信任我最亲密的下属。没有人会想到马蒂亚斯如此憎恨教会的现状。}
### {575}{}{He was against your policy, wasn't he?}
{575}{}{他反对你的政策，不是吗？}
### {576}{}{Mathias advocated the isolation of the cathedral from the world and the complete preservation of our relics. He didn't want to share them with outsiders and didn't see anyone who was worthy of them. I didn't agree. The time has come when this knowledge should be extracted from dust and mold in the name of the Sacred Fire.}
{576}{}{马蒂亚斯主张将大教堂与世界隔绝，并完全保护我们的遗迹。他不想和外人分享，也看不到任何值得分享的人。我不同意。到了应该以圣火的名义从灰尘和霉菌中提取这些知识的时候了。}
### {577}{}{Apparently, not everyone liked it.}
{577}{}{显然，并不是每个人都喜欢它。}
### {578}{}{(makes a gracious face) You've done a good job, brother. And more importantly, he remained loyal. I need your further help to cleanse the Phoenix lands of filth.}
{578}{}{（做了一个和蔼的表情）你做得很好，兄弟。更重要的是，他依然忠诚。我需要你的进一步帮助来净化凤凰城的污秽。}
### {1578}{}{ (makes a gracious face) You've done a good job, Sister. And more importantly, she remained loyal. I need your further help to cleanse the lands of the Phoenix from filth.}
{1578}{}{（做了一个和蔼的表情）你做得很好，姐姐。更重要的是，她依然忠诚。我需要你的进一步帮助来净化凤凰城的土地。}
### {579}{}{Anything for the sake of the Sacred Fire, Your Holiness.}
{579}{}{任何为了圣火的事，陛下。}
### {580}{}{What is required of me this time?}
{580}{}{这次需要我做什么？}
### {581}{}{Obviously, a gang of fire-haters is operating in the city. Well-organized and armed. We'll get all the information about them out of Mathias, but that's not enough. You are required to find their lair and infiltrate their ranks. Can you handle it?}
{581}{}{很明显，一伙仇视消防的人正在这个城市活动。组织严密，武装精良。我们会从马蒂亚斯那里得到所有关于他们的信息，但这还不够。你必须找到他们的巢穴并渗透到他们的队伍中。你能应付吗？}
### {582}{}{Perhaps. But why me?}
{582}{}{可能但为什么是我？}
### {583}{}{You are still a new person for our church. It's unlikely the rebels will identify you as one of us.}
{583}{}{你仍然是我们教会的新人。叛军不太可能认出你是我们中的一员。}
### {584}{}{If I find their lair, what should I do next?}
{584}{}{如果我找到他们的巢穴，下一步该怎么办？}
### {585}{}{Let me know about it. We will decide what to do next.}
{585}{}{让我知道这件事。我们将决定下一步做什么。}
### {586}{}{How do I do this?}
{586}{}{我该怎么做？}
### {587}{}{Mathias used the radio to communicate with the rebels. Besides, many residents in the city are probably connected with this gang. Try all possible means.}
{587}{}{马蒂亚斯用无线电与叛军通信。此外，该市许多居民可能与该团伙有关联。尽一切可能。}
### {588}{}{I'll do my best. Let me take my leave.}
{588}{}{我会尽力的。让我走吧。}
### {589}{}{But why me?}
{589}{}{但为什么是我？}
### {590}{}{However, you turned out to be very selective about the "worthy", right?}
{590}{}{然而，事实证明，你对“有价值的”非常挑剔，对吧？}

#The second quest
### {600}{}{The situation with the rebels has cleared up.}
{600}{}{与叛军的关系已经缓和。}

### {611}{}{The locals, friendly at first, got angry at the church for some reason. Our attempts to reason with them only made the situation worse. We don't know exactly what's going on. George Crook's detachment is now on the outskirts of the village. Find him and offer your help. It is necessary to return our trade agreements with this village.}
