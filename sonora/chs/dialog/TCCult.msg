### {100}{}{You see Abel.}
{100}{}{你看到亚伯了。}
### {101}{}{Here is a representative of the Church of the Sacred Fire.}
{101}{}{这是拜火教的代表。}

#The first dialog
### {200}{}{Are you here on business? Then you need to see Master Hard. It can be found in the workshop.}
{200}{}{你是来出差的吗？那你得去见硬大师。它可以在车间里找到。}
### {201}{}{Thank you.}
{201}{}{非常感谢。}
### {202}{}{I would like to meet you specifically.}
{202}{}{我想专门和你见面。}
### {203}{}{Too kind to be true. My name is Abel, I am one of the Followers of Fire, if that means anything to you. Now stop wasting my time.}
{203}{}{太善良了，不可能是真的。我的名字叫亚伯，我是拜火教徒之一，如果这对你有什么意义的话。现在别再浪费我的时间了。}
### {204}{}{What are you doing?}
{204}{}{你在干什么？}
### {205}{}{I see you're not going to get rid of that easily. The church needs the services of tinsmiths, just like any modern community. I am assigned to monitor the fulfillment of orders.}
{205}{}{我看你不会轻易摆脱的。教堂需要铁匠的服务，就像任何现代社区一样。我被指派监督订单的履行情况。}
### {206}{}{Are the tinkers that good?}
{206}{}{修补匠有那么好吗？}
### {207}{}{They are the best in their field. You may have already come across their inventions. Pneumatic weapons, computing devices, even prosthetics and simple implants. Fortunately, tinkerers aren't stupid enough to deal with the first person they meet. They are reluctant to share knowledge and technology. Our church had the honor to find a common language with them.}
{207}{}{他们是本领域最好的。你可能已经发现了他们的发明。气动武器，计算机设备，甚至假肢和简单的植入物。幸运的是，修补匠们并没有愚蠢到与他们遇到的第一个人打交道。他们不愿分享知识和技术。我们的教会有幸与他们找到了共同的语言。}
### {208}{}{It shows. Well, I'll look at it all in action. Goodbye.}
{208}{}{它显示了。好吧，我会看看所有的行动。再见}
### {209}{}{Simply put, someone coveted power in this region. Have a nice day.}
{209}{}{简单地说，有人觊觎这个地区的权力。祝你今天愉快。}

### {210}{}{You again?}
{210}{}{你又来了？}
### {211}{}{Forget it.}
{211}{}{算了。}
### {212}{}{How can I help, brother?}
{212}{}{我能帮你什么，兄弟？}
### {1212}{}{How can I help, Sister?}
{1212}{}{姐姐，我能帮忙吗？}
### {213}{}{Thanks, I'll figure it out later somehow.}
{213}{}{谢谢，我稍后会想办法的。}
### {214}{}{Enough information for today.}
{214}{}{今天有足够的信息。}
### {215}{}{I'm the one wasting time talking to you.}
{215}{}{我是那个浪费时间和你说话的人。}
### {216}{}{No problem, I'll leave immediately.}
{216}{}{没问题，我马上就走。}

### {220}{}{Tell me about your church.}
{220}{}{告诉我你的教堂。}
### {221}{}{This is too long a conversation. It's better to visit our temple in Phoenix and find out about everything directly.}
{221}{}{这段对话太长了。最好去参观我们在凤凰城的寺庙，直接了解一切。}
### {222}{}{Good.}
{222}{}{好的}

### {230}{}{Actually, I'm also a Follower of Fire.}
{230}{}{事实上，我也是拜火教徒。}
### {231}{}{Really? It changes a lot. Welcome to Two-Sun, brother. Together we will glorify the Sacred Fire.}
{231}{}{真正地它变化很大。欢迎来到二孙，兄弟。我们将一起赞美圣火。}
### {1231}{}{Really? It changes a lot. Welcome to Two-Sun, Sister. Together we will glorify the Sacred Fire.}
{1231}{}{真正地它变化很大。欢迎来到二孙，姐姐。我们将一起赞美圣火。}
### {232}{}{I see you're more accommodating now. Can you answer a few questions?}
{232}{}{我看你现在更随和了。你能回答几个问题吗？}
### {233}{}{I see.}
{233}{}{我明白了。}
### {234}{}{Thank you for the answer. Now it's time for me to get busy.}
{234}{}{谢谢你的回答。现在是我忙碌的时候了。}

### {240}{}{What does the church in Two-Sun actually do?}
{240}{}{两个太阳里的教堂到底做什么？}
### {241}{}{As I have already said, the church needs technology and knowledge. This is one of our main postulates - the Sacred Fire incinerated the old civilization in order to build a new one in its place. The tinkerers are the builders of this new civilization. Their production skills and technologies are necessary for survival and development. Unfortunately, many in the wastelands do not understand the idea of Progress, they are afraid to change their ossified way of life.}
{241}{}{正如我已经说过的，教会需要技术和知识。这是我们的主要假设之一――圣火焚烧了旧文明，以便在其位置上建立一个新文明。修修补补者是这个新文明的建设者。他们的生产技能和技术是生存和发展所必需的。不幸的是，荒原上的许多人不理解进步的理念，他们害怕改变僵化的生活方式。}
### {242}{}{What orders are being carried out by tinsmiths now?}
{242}{}{锡匠们现在正在执行什么订单？}
### {243}{}{The most important order is energy batteries. Without them, any serious equipment is no more valuable than a pile of garbage. They also make weapons and repair old electronics.}
{243}{}{最重要的订单是能源电池。没有它们，任何严肃的设备都不比一堆垃圾更有价值。他们还制造武器和修理旧电子产品。}
### {244}{}{Where did the tinkerers learn about these technologies?}
{244}{}{修补工们从哪里了解到这些技术的？}
### {245}{}{Their skills have been passed down from generation to generation. They received some documentation through our church or bought it from caravans.}
{245}{}{他们的技艺代代相传。他们通过我们的教堂收到了一些文件，或者从大篷车上买来的。}
### {246}{}{Do you not preach in this city?}
{246}{}{你不在这个城市传教吗？}
### {247}{}{The church is striving to expand, but it is enough to have one ambassador in Two-Sun. Tinkerers do not share our faith in everything, but their sympathies are enough for joint achievements.}
{247}{}{教会正在努力扩张，但在两个太阳里有一个大使就足够了。修补匠们并不认同我们对每件事的信仰，但他们的同情足以让我们共同取得成就。}
### {248}{}{Something tells me that there are orders that you would prefer to keep quiet about.}
{248}{}{有件事告诉我，有些订单你更愿意保持沉默。}
### {249}{}{Now I see why the church accepted you. Yes, there are several special technologies that mere mortals should not know about. This may upset the balance of power or cause waves of protest among the population.}
{249}{}{现在我明白教会为什么接受你了。是的，有几种特殊的技术是凡人不应该知道的。这可能会破坏权力平衡，或在民众中引发抗议浪潮。}
### {250}{}{In history, it is not uncommon for peaceful technologies to be used as weapons. Their harm outweighed their benefit.}
{250}{}{在历史上，和平技术被用作武器并不罕见。他们弊大于利。}
### {251}{}{If anyone can ensure progress in this region, it is only us - the servants of the Sacred Fire. We have lived with this idea and are not going to give it up. Believe me, the church is doing everything to turn Sonora into a thriving paradise.}
{251}{}{如果有人能确保在这个地区取得进展，那只有我们――神圣之火的仆人。我们一直接受这个想法，不会放弃。相信我，教会正在尽一切努力把索诺拉变成一个繁荣的天堂。}

### {260}{}{The tinsmiths enslaved several of my acquaintances. Is there any way to release them?}
{260}{}{铁匠们奴役了我的几个熟人。有办法释放他们吗？}
### {261}{}{But why ? I don't think your acquaintances are that valuable outside of slave bondage. To serve Progress is a great honor and benefit to all mankind. In any case, most of the slaves have already been sent to the Forbidden Zone. You'll have to go there and save your friends yourself.}
{261}{}{但为什么呢？我认为你的熟人在奴隶束缚之外没有那么值钱。为进步服务是全人类的巨大荣誉和利益。无论如何，大多数奴隶已经被送到了禁区。你必须亲自去救你的朋友。}
### {262}{}{While I'm looking for a solution, let's talk about other topics.}
{262}{}{在我寻找解决方案的同时，让我们谈谈其他话题。}
### {263}{}{I think there must be a way to free them. Later.}
{263}{}{我认为一定有办法解放他们。后来}

### {300}{}{You again? Get out of this town before I call the guards.}
{300}{}{你又来了？在我叫警卫之前离开这个小镇。}
### {301}{}{Wait, why so much hostility?}
{301}{}{等等，为什么这么多敌意？}
### {302}{}{Don't speak my tongue, atomic ignorance! The Followers of Fire have a good network of informants, I have already been informed about your exile. Get out!}
{302}{}{别说我的舌头，原子的无知！拜火教徒有一个很好的线人网络，我已经被告知你被流放的消息。滚出去！}
### {303}{}{Calm down...}
{303}{}{冷静}

### {310}{}{Wait. Who sent you?}
{310}{}{等待谁派你来的？}
### {311}{}{No one. Why are you so nervous?}
{311}{}{没有人你为什么这么紧张？}
### {312}{}{I have my reasons. And you shouldn't show up in this city at all. It is very suspicious that the enemy of the Followers of Fire suddenly visited the tinsmiths. It looks like you're playing your game right under our noses.}
{312}{}{我有自己的理由。你根本不应该出现在这个城市。非常可疑的是，拜火教徒的敌人突然造访了铁匠铺。看起来你在我们眼皮底下玩游戏。}
### {313}{}{So the Church of Fire is no longer in high esteem here?}
{313}{}{所以火之教会在这里不再受人尊敬了？}
### {314}{}{The Church was the main engine of progress in Southern Arizona. Now that the main temple has been destroyed, it will take a lot of effort to regain its former greatness and trust. But the tinsmiths have served us for almost ten years. They will not betray their patrons because of a single misunderstanding.}
{314}{}{教会是亚利桑那州南部进步的主要引擎。现在主庙已经被毁，要想恢复昔日的伟大和信任，还需要付出很多努力。但是这些铁匠已经为我们服务了将近十年。他们不会因为一个误会就背叛他们的赞助人。}
### {315}{}{But then why are you so turned on? Looks like the tinkerers were less submissive, right?}
{315}{}{但你为什么这么兴奋？看起来修补匠们没有那么顺从了，对吧？}
### {316}{}{We thought of them as working machines. Now that they felt free and superior, they could use a charge of electric current to put them in their place. And now stop making fun, you despicable atom. Get out of my sight.}
{316}{}{我们认为它们是工作机器。既然他们感到自由和优越，他们就可以用一股电流把他们安置在自己的位置上。现在别开玩笑了，你这个卑鄙的原子。离开我的视线。}
### {317}{}{You know, it's not me who needs to get out of Two-Sun. And you.}
{317}{}{你知道，不是我需要离开两个太阳。还有你。}
### {318}{}{Have a good stay, misanthrope...}
{318}{}{祝你住得愉快，厌世的人...}
### {319}{}{Come on, it's not that bad...}
{319}{}{来吧，没那么糟...}
### {320}{}{Leave me, demon of atomic division!}
{320}{}{离开我，原子分裂的恶魔！}
### {321}{}{What are you...}
{321}{}{你是什么...}
