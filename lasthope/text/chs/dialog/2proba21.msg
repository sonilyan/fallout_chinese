{100}{}{I got nothing to talk about.}
{101}{}{Mind your own business!}
{102}{}{I'm quite busy here.}
{103}{}{Where are those papers?}
{104}{}{Is somebody going to give me those papers I requested?!}
#
{105}{}{OK, I've got a minute. Say, what do you want?}
#
{106}{}{Looks like you have some kind of an "organization" going on here. Tell me what's the deal?}
{107}{}{Nothing.}
#
{108}{}{You again. What is it now?}
#organization
{109}{}{Well, it's not a "real" organization, more like a group of people helping each other to survive. Believe it or
 not, we actually live here. Collecting and repairing all kinds of junk became our way of living. If it can be sold,
 even better.}
#
{110}{}{Do you happen to know anything about missing people, they were last seen in this area?}
{111}{}{I have some bad news for you. Someone's blaming your group for the recent disappearances.}
#missing people
{112}{}{We'll get to that. You see, everybody thinks if they're gone, something bad had happened to them and usually
 we're the first on the suspect list. This time however I'm sure of one thing, something bad did happen and I know who did it.}
#
{113}{}{So, what's the truth?}
#
{114}{}{Basil's men did it, and I saw the whole thing! It was late, almost midnight. I was coming back from the field
 and saw two men and Mr. Basil. At first I thought they were just looking for something they had lost, but when I
 came a little closer I saw another person laying on the ground. I couldn't tell if that person passed out or... gone
 for real, but they didn't leave the poor guy on the ground. Instead they dragged him all the way and quickly
 disappeared into the night. I don't know where they left after that, it was too dangerous to even think of following
 them in the middle of the night. I tried to tell what happened... got ridiculed every time.}
#
{115}{}{Hm, I will tell the sheriff about it. Thanks for your help.}
{116}{}{So sad, but I don't buy it!}
#i will tell
{117}{}{You really want to help? That's very nice to hear but we need others to know the truth as well. Just make
 sure you tell them everything I told you.}
#
{118}{}{No problem.}
#don't believe you
{119}{}{Why not?! I mean, what's wrong, don't you believe me? I think there's something wrong with you, you
 stupid fuck! Get the fuck out of here! And don't think you'll get away in one piece if you ever come back!}
#
{120}{}{Easy, I'm going.}
{121}{}{Wait, I've got some treats for you! Want some fucking ice with your bullet holes!?}
#recent disappearances
{122}{}{What the hell are you talking about? What disappearances? I think you better go, I don't like your tongue!}
#
{123}{}{Hey you're back. Have you told them about this misunderstanding?}
#
{124}{}{Not yet.}
{125}{}{Yes I did, it was well received.}
#
{126}{}{Thank you very much stranger. I got some money and stims, take these and be on your way.}
{127}{}{Thanks, take care.}
#
{128}{}{You helped us very much. Thanks again.}
{129}{}{No problem.}
