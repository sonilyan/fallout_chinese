### {100}{}{This is Arthur Carrington.}
{100}{}{我是阿瑟・卡林顿。}
### {101}{}{You see the same archaeologist from Vault 27.}
{101}{}{你看到的是27号金库的同一位考古学家。}

#The first dialog
### {200}{}{It's good to see you again. I have to thank you for the honor. Your Villa opens up new facets for my research work. And I'm already amazed at new discoveries! The way you cope without high technology - it amazes every understanding. Although some technologies should be brought back into use.}
{200}{}{很高兴再次见到你。我得感谢你的荣幸。你的别墅为我的研究工作开辟了新的方面。我已经对新发现感到惊讶了！在没有高科技的情况下，你的应对方式让每个人都感到惊讶。尽管有些技术应该重新投入使用。}
### {201}{}{Maybe so.}
{201}{}{也许是这样。}
### {210}{}{Yes, yes?}
{210}{}{是的，是吗？}
### {211}{}{Nothing. Bye.}
{211}{}{没有什么再见}
### {212}{}{Enough about that.}
{212}{}{够了。}

### {220}{}{How did you get settled?}
{220}{}{你是怎么安顿下来的？}
### {221}{}{To be honest, your tribesmen are not happy with strangers. Children laugh at my thin physique, and adults shun conversations. You are the only reason that holds back their discontent. But on the other hand, I see interest. Interest in what used to be taboo for your community.}
{221}{}{老实说，你们部落的人对陌生人不满意。孩子们嘲笑我瘦弱的体格，成年人则避而不谈。你是阻止他们不满的唯一原因。但另一方面，我看到了兴趣。对你所在社区过去的禁忌感兴趣。}
### {222}{}{What technologies do you think should be returned?}
{222}{}{你认为应该归还哪些技术？}
### {223}{}{Manual labor is tedious and inefficient. According to my calculations, the aqueduct alone will increase yields by 250% and reduce labor resources by 40%. Unfortunately, the headman does not want to listen to me.}
{223}{}{体力劳动既乏味又低效。根据我的计算，仅渡槽一项就将使产量增加250%，劳动力资源减少40%。不幸的是，校长不想听我说话。}
### {224}{}{The villa has so far managed without high technology.}
{224}{}{到目前为止，这座别墅的管理还没有高科技。}
### {225}{}{Yes, but at what cost? Diseases, periodic crop failures, injury hazards and difficult working conditions for the body are only the main troubles that simple pre-war technologies, such as a pump or electric lighting, would help to avoid.}
{225}{}{是的，但要花多少钱？疾病、周期性作物歉收、受伤危险和身体工作条件困难只是战前简单技术（如水泵或电灯）有助于避免的主要问题。}
### {226}{}{Do you think the Villa should change?}
{226}{}{你认为维拉应该改变吗？}
### {227}{}{This is an unanswered question. It's up to you to live and decide. But someday the flame of civilization will reignite in the south. Will you be able to resist in such a struggle? I doubt. You couldn't even defend yourself against a handful of mercenaries with primitive rifles.}
{227}{}{这是一个没有答案的问题。这取决于你的生活和决定。但总有一天，文明的火焰会在南方重新点燃。在这样的斗争中你能抵抗吗？我怀疑。你甚至无法用原始步枪抵御少数雇佣兵。}
### {230}{}{One of the residents is now lying in a hot delirium. Can you cure him?}
{230}{}{其中一名居民现在正躺在火热的谵妄中。你能治好他吗？}
### {231}{}{I also had to do a little medicine. I think I can help. But keep in mind that your tribesmen have a negative attitude to pre-war medicine.}
{231}{}{我还得吃点药。我想我能帮上忙。但请记住，你的部落成员对战前医学持消极态度。}
### {232}{}{We don't have time to think about such things. Cure him!}
{232}{}{我们没有时间去想这些事情。治好他！}
### {233}{}{I will try to cure it with my own means.}
{233}{}{我会设法用我自己的方法治好它。}
### {234}{}{Our weather station is damaged. Can you fix it?}
{234}{}{我们的气象站坏了。你能修好吗？}
### {235}{}{Sure. Meteorology is one of my favorite sciences.}
{235}{}{当然气象学是我最喜欢的科学之一。}
### {236}{}{Then do it.}
{236}{}{那就去做吧。}
### {237}{}{However, I'll try it first.}
{237}{}{不过，我会先试试。}
