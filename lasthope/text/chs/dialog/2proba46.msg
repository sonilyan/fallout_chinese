### {105}{}{This is a public library... or what's left of it. You can find some old books here if you like to read. Most of these are in electronic format, all kept in this computer. [Sighs.] Took me years to type them down, letter by letter. We just had too many books... This was the best way to preserve data and reduce data search time. We also hold public discussions from time to time.}
{105}{}{这是一个公共图书馆。。。或者剩下什么。如果你喜欢读的话，你可以在这里找到一些旧书。其中大部分都是电子格式的，都保存在这台电脑中。[叹气]我花了好几年时间才把它们一个字母一个字母地打下来。我们只是有太多的书。。。这是保存数据和减少数据搜索时间的最佳方式。我们还不时举行公开讨论。}

### {109}{}{I can't say for sure, you have to check on the shelves. But don't be disappointed, some of them were in very bad shape. While the good ones were scanned into our electronic database and sold in exchange for equipment. You can use the computer to find what you need. [Pushes a button on her console.] It should work now. Take your time.}
{109}{}{我不能肯定，你必须检查一下货架。但不要失望，他们中的一些人状态非常糟糕。而好的则被扫描到我们的电子数据库中，以换取设备。你可以用电脑找到你需要的东西。[按下控制台上的按钮。]现在应该可以工作了。慢慢来。}
### {110}{}{Thanks.}
{110}{}{谢谢}
### {111}{}{Well, yes. Most recently we have been talking about the security problems in our town. Especially the more frequent bandit attacks have become a number one priority in our discussions. Ever since their base got compromised, the Dogs are spread all over the waste, leaving a trail of dead in their wake. We're currently planning to push them away from the surrounding areas, and gathered as many people as we could, but there are still plenty of seats left...}
{111}{}{嗯，是的。最近我们一直在谈论我们镇上的安全问题。特别是更频繁的土匪袭击已成为我们讨论的首要任务。自从他们的基地被破坏后，狗就遍布垃圾场，留下了一条死亡的痕迹。我们目前正计划将他们从周边地区赶走，并尽可能多地聚集人群，但仍有大量座位。。。}
### {112}{}{Can I join the group?}
{112}{}{我可以加入这个小组吗？}
### {113}{}{Let me ask you something else then.}
{113}{}{那我再问你一件事。}
### {114}{}{I'm Jasmine and I run this library. This might be of interest to you, most of the books we had were transcribed into the computer but we still get new ones from time to time. First, we check them for integrity, then cleaning, sorting pages if needed... Personally, I like every part of this job. I kept some of my favorite books in their original format. Nothing makes me feel better than holding and reading a real book. Don't you agree?}
{114}{}{我是Jasmine，我经营这个图书馆。这可能会引起你的兴趣，我们的大多数书都被转录到了电脑中，但我们仍然会时不时地收到新的。首先，我们检查它们的完整性，然后根据需要对页面进行清理和排序。。。就我个人而言，我喜欢这份工作的每一部分。我保留了一些我最喜欢的书的原始格式。没有什么比拿着一本真正的书读更让我感觉更好的了。你不同意吗？}
### {115}{}{Yeah, you're right.}
{115}{}{是的，你说得对。}
### {116}{}{I can make better use of them once downloaded to my pip-boy.}

### {118}{}{OK, say it...}
{118}{}{好吧，说吧。。。}
### {119}{}{I'm looking for an old edition called The Lavender Flower. I'm worried because I had that book in my library and now it's gone, I can't find it anywhere. It's really weird, I always keep rare ones in my locker. Maybe... you see, we never lock the doors because there's always somebody inside. I doubt it and I don?t like accusing others without proof... but there's a local drunkard wandering about town... people call him Crazy Booze. He's drunk most of the time but don't let that fool you, he's all trouble even when he is sober. Maybe he tried to steal something from my locker, saw that book and thought he could sell it. Can you pay him a visit, see if he has my book?}
{119}{}{我在找一本名为《薰衣草花》的旧版。我很担心，因为我图书馆里有那本书，现在它不见了，我哪儿也找不到。这真的很奇怪，我总是把稀有的放在储物柜里。大概你看，我们从不锁门，因为里面总有人。我对此表示怀疑?我不喜欢在没有证据的情况下指责别人。。。但当地有个酒鬼在城里游荡。。。人们称他为疯狂的布兹。他大部分时间都喝醉了，但别让这骗了你，即使他清醒了，他也很麻烦。也许他想从我的储物柜里偷东西，看到那本书，以为可以卖掉。你能去拜访他吗，看看他有没有我的书？}
### {120}{}{Sure thing Jasmine. I hope he's not lying unconscious somewhere... }
{120}{}{当然，茉莉。我希望他不是躺在什么地方不省人事。。。}
### {121}{}{Hm, another hi-tech nerd... good for you. Too bad you don't appreciate real sentimental values. I don't want to waste your time then.}
{121}{}{嗯，又一个高科技书呆子。。。对你有好处。可惜你不欣赏真正的情感价值观。那我不想浪费你的时间。}
### {122}{}{Let me ask you something else then.}

{141}{}{他的办公室在北边，你不能错过指示牌。}
### {142}{}{Yeah, Mr. Aston... He owns that fancy power generator. He used to travel when he was about your age, now he has enough money to hire some young cowboy for the job... [smiles]. You can find his place north-east of here. Be careful though, if his men don't let you in, don't mess with them. Last guy who tried that took a good beating. Now he's nowhere to be found, probably left town in a hurry.}
{142}{}{是的，阿斯顿先生。。。他拥有那台奇特的发电机。当他和你差不多大的时候，他经常旅行，现在他有足够的钱雇一些年轻的牛仔来做这份工作。。。[微笑]。你可以在这里东北方向找到他的住处。不过要小心，如果他的人不让你进去，就不要惹他们。最后一个尝试的人被狠狠地打了一顿。现在他不见了，可能是匆忙离开了小镇。}
