### {10}{}{[Catty was never very girly in her manners, but now only her cute face reminds you that she is a woman. A dirty, baggy robe that she is wearing, patched in a dozen places and covered in oil and dirt, surprises with the letters "Brook" sewn onto it. You remember that female Technology Servant is not a very common thing in Tartarus. Catty looks tired but pretty happy. When you approach, she notices you - and her face explodes with a look of surprise and happiness] You?! Is it really you?}
{10}{}{[凯蒂的举止从来都不是很少女，但现在只有她可爱的脸让你想起她是一个女人。她穿着一件脏兮兮的宽松长袍，上面有十几处补丁，沾满了油和泥土，上面缝着“布鲁克”的字母，令人惊讶。你还记得，在塔尔塔罗斯，女性技术仆人并不是一件很常见的事情。凯蒂看起来很累，但很开心。当你走近时，她注意到了你――她的脸上流露出惊讶和幸福的表情]你？！真的是你吗？}
### {11}{002}{Yes, it's-}
{11}{002}{是的，是的-}
### {12}{002}{No, it's not me.}
{12}{002}{不，不是我。}

### {20}{}{[Catty grabs your wrist and cautiously looks around] Are you out of your mind? If they see you, the Mouth of Hades is the easiest option that could happen to you. Sons of Gods haven't forgotten how you ran off after the guard's death.}
{20}{}{[凯蒂抓住你的手腕，谨慎地环顾四周]你疯了吗？如果他们看到你，哈迪斯之口是可能发生在你身上的最简单的选择。众神之子们还没有忘记你是如何在警卫死后逃跑的。}
### {21}{003}{Yeah, I'm glad to see you too, Catty.}
{21}{003}{是的，我也很高兴见到你，凯蒂。}
### {22}{004}{I didn't even lay a finger on that guard!}
{22}{004}{我甚至一根手指都没碰到那个警卫！}
### {23}{005}{I was actually trying to help that guard!}
{23}{005}{我其实是想帮助那个警卫！}
### {24}{003}{It's gonna be alright - if you won't be shouting and waving hands, pointing at me.}
{24}{003}{一切都会好起来的――如果你不大喊大叫，不挥手，不指着我。}

### {30}{}{[She looks around again, making sure no one is looking and smacks your head with a ringing slap with all her might. Judging by the power of slapping, her job keeps her in a pretty good physical shape.]}
{30}{}{[她又环顾四周，确保没有人在看，然后用尽全力扇你一记响亮的耳光。从拍打的力量来看，她的工作使她保持了相当好的身体状态。]}
### {31}{}{[She looks around again, making sure no one is looking, and with one fast move wraps her hands around you, hugging.]}
{31}{}{[她再次环顾四周，确保没有人在看，然后用一个快速的动作将她的手紧紧地抱在你身上。]}
### {32}{006}{Hey!}
{32}{006}{嘿}
### {33}{006}{[tightly hug her back]}
{33}{006}{[紧紧地抱着她的背]}

### {40}{}{Yeah, I'm not stupid. I've seen the body. You couldn't do it with your bare hands even if you tried to... Even if you were armed with some metal junk... Anyway, the guards don't care. They will kill you when they see you.}
{40}{}{是的，我并不愚蠢。我见过尸体。即使你试着…即使你带着一些金属垃圾…你也不能徒手做。。。不管怎样，警卫不在乎。他们看到你就会杀了你。}
### {41}{003}{Are you always meeting your friends with "they will kill you"?}
{41}{003}{你总是以“他们会杀了你”来迎接你的朋友吗？}
### {42}{003}{So, I suppose you are glad to see me?}
{42}{003}{所以，我想你很高兴见到我吧？}

### {50}{}{I remember. But the guard doesn't care. If you get in a sight of someone not wasted by booze, they will kill you.}
{50}{}{我记得。但警卫并不在乎。如果你看到一个没有喝醉的人，他们会杀了你。}
### {51}{003}{Are you always meeting your friends with "they will kill you"?}
{51}{003}{你总是以“他们会杀了你”来迎接你的朋友吗？}
### {52}{003}{So, I suppose you are glad to see me?}
{52}{003}{所以，我想你很高兴见到我吧？}

### {60}{}{[She takes a few steps back, calming down, and sits on the rusty pile of heap] You know, I didn't think you were gonna make it. That cave you ran off into... You know what they say. I'm glad to see you, of course - but I'm still willing to unscrew that head of yours for so mindlessly wandering in here like you are the favorite of Gods... [she glances over you] Damn! I want to talk about so many things... I... I don't know where to start! [she stops for a moment] How are you doing? Tell me what you went through after running off. And then I'll tell you how we are doing here. }
{60}{}{[她后退几步，冷静下来，坐在生锈的堆上]你知道，我没想到你会成功。你跑进的那个洞穴。。。你知道他们怎么说的。当然，我很高兴见到你，但我仍然愿意拧下你的头，因为你如此盲目地在这里游荡，就像你是上帝的宠儿一样。。。[她瞥了你一眼]该死！我想谈很多事情。。。我…我不知道从哪里开始！[她停了一会儿]你好吗？告诉我你逃跑后经历了什么。然后我告诉你我们在这里过得怎么样。}
### {61}{007}{Well, the world outside is nothing like we were told... [tell her about your escape, Radius, and its inhabitants]}
{61}{007}{外面的世界一点也不像我们被告知的那样。。。[告诉她你的逃亡，Radius和它的居民]}

### {70}{}{[Catty listened to you thoughtfully, without interrupting. Looks like she became more serious and calm since your last meeting] Holy shit - that's all I can say. I'm still having trouble believing it. And about the Radius - you know, it sounds like not a bad place... [she looks at a big wrench in her hand] If you have a big gun and many bullets. Looks like this place is a lot safer. And we have order maintained here - for example, three days ago one guard punished some boy for stealing. Ten strokes with a stick, and then he got his hand mangled with the guard's armored boot. }
{70}{}{[凯蒂仔细地听了你的话，没有打断你。看起来自从你上次见面以来，她变得更加严肃和冷静了]天哪，我只能这么说了。我还是很难相信。关于Radius，你知道，它听起来不错。。。[她看着手里的一把大扳手]如果你有一把大刀和很多子弹。看起来这个地方安全多了。我们在这里维持着秩序――例如，三天前，一名警卫因一个男孩偷窃而惩罚了他。用棍子打了十下，然后他的手被警卫的装甲靴弄伤了。}
### {71}{010}{Uhh... }
{71}{010}{嗯。。。}

### {100}{}{Hey! Glad to see you alive and well. [Catty hugs you, then steps back and glances over you] How are you?}
{100}{}{嘿很高兴看到你安然无恙。[凯蒂拥抱你，然后退后一步，瞥了你一眼]你好吗？}
### {101}{}{[she sighs] You must be having a lot of questions. Or answers.}
{101}{}{[她叹了口气]你肯定有很多问题。或者答案。}
### {102}{027}{I see that you're treating me differently than before. Am I right?}
{102}{027}{我看到你对我的态度和以前不一样了。我说得对吗？}
### {103}{030}{What are the current news?}
{103}{030}{目前的新闻是什么？}
### {104}{035}{How... What happened with my dad since I left?}
{104}{035}{怎样我离开后我爸爸怎么了？}
### {105}{036}{I've been through a lot. Want me to tell you about it?}
{105}{036}{我经历了很多。想让我告诉你吗？}
### {106}{055}{What happened here while I was away? I mean, after my escape.}
{106}{055}{我不在的时候这里发生了什么？我的意思是，在我逃跑之后。}
### {107}{011}{I need to see my dad. I'll come by later.}
{107}{011}{我需要去见我爸爸。我稍后再来。}
### {108}{011}{Okay, I need to go. I'll come again soon.}
{108}{011}{好的，我得走了。我很快就会再来。}

### {110}{}{[she comes closer and hugs you] Take care.}
{110}{}{[她走近拥抱你]小心。}
### {111}{999}{[end of dialogue]}
{111}{999}{[对话结束]}

### {120}{}{[Catty was never very girly in her manners, but now only her cute face reminds you that she is a woman. A dirty, baggy robe that she is wearing, patched in a dozen places and covered in oil and dirt, surprises with the letters "Brook" sewn onto it. You remember that female Technology Servant is not a very common thing in Tartarus. Catty looks tired but pretty happy. When you approach, she raises her eyes on you, wiping the sweat from her forehead with a tired gesture] Yes? I'm doing my daily duties. What can I help the noble Son of Gods with?}
{120}{}{[凯蒂的举止从来都不是很少女，但现在只有她可爱的脸让你想起她是一个女人。她穿着一件脏兮兮的宽松长袍，上面有十几处补丁，沾满了油和泥土，上面缝着“布鲁克”的字母，令人惊讶。你还记得，在塔尔塔罗斯，女性技术仆人并不是一件很常见的事情。凯蒂看起来很累，但很开心。当你走近时，她抬起眼睛看着你，疲惫地擦拭着额头上的汗水]是吗？我在做我的日常工作。我能用什么来帮助这位高贵的众神之子？}
### {121}{013}{Clean my boots, for a start.}
{121}{013}{先把我的靴子擦干净。}
### {122}{013}{We have toilets clogged, they need to be taken care of...}
{122}{013}{我们的厕所堵塞了，需要照顾。。。}
### {123}{018}{[remove the helmet, wink at her, then put it back]}
{123}{018}{[摘下头盔，向她眨眼，然后把它放回原处]}

{124}{013}{我在找一个可以过夜的女人。}
### {125}{022}{I missed you, that's all.}
{125}{022}{我想你了，仅此而已。}

### {130}{}{Wh-... What?}
{130}{}{为什么。。。什么}
### {131}{014}{[remove the helmet, wink at her, then put it back]}
{131}{014}{[摘下头盔，向她眨眼，然后把它放回原处]}
### {132}{021}{You heard me, Servant!}
{132}{021}{你听见了，仆人！}

### {140}{}{[Looks like she is speechless. Her face indicates she is shocked, then you see a shadow of happiness - and then she suddenly turns red, grabs a wrench, and strikes you between your legs]}
{140}{}{[看起来她无言以对。她的脸表明她很震惊，然后你看到了幸福的影子――然后她突然变红了，抓起扳手，用两腿击打你]}
### {141}{015}{[you try to cover your groin, although your armor turned out to be sturdy enough to protect you from the blow. Still, your heart is pounding] I suppose you are glad to see me.}
{141}{015}{[你试着盖住腹股沟，尽管你的盔甲足够坚固，可以保护你免受打击。尽管如此，你的心还是砰砰作响]我想你很高兴见到我。}

### {150}{}{You, asshole! [Catty is furiously flaring her nostrils] What kind of joke is that? Especially after you escaped the way you did! }
{150}{}{你，混蛋！[凯蒂疯狂地张开鼻孔]这是什么笑话？尤其是在你以这种方式逃脱之后！}
### {151}{016}{Calm down, Catty! I was just goofing around! }
{151}{016}{冷静点，凯蒂！我只是在闲逛！}
### {152}{016}{Can't I make a joke once in a while?}
{152}{016}{我不能偶尔开个玩笑吗？}
### {153}{016}{Okay, chill!}
{153}{016}{好的，冷静！}

### {160}{}{Take off your helmet. }
{160}{}{摘下你的头盔。}
### {161}{017}{What?}
{161}{017}{什么}
### {162}{017}{Why?}
{162}{017}{为什么？}
### {163}{003}{Okay... [take off your helmet]}
{163}{003}{可以[摘下你的头盔]}

### {170}{}{Oh Gods, just take off this goddamn helmet!}
{170}{}{天啊，把这该死的头盔摘下来！}
### {171}{003}{Okay... [take off your helmet]}
{171}{003}{可以[摘下你的头盔]}

### {180}{}{You? It's really... [Catty grabs your wrist and cautiously looks around] Are you out of your mind? If they see you, the Mouth of Hades is the easiest option that could happen to you. Sons of Gods haven't forgotten how you ran off after the guard's death.}
{180}{}{你真的。。。[凯蒂抓住你的手腕，谨慎地环顾四周]你疯了吗？如果他们看到你，哈迪斯之口是可能发生在你身上的最简单的选择。众神之子们还没有忘记你是如何在警卫死后逃跑的。}
### {181}{019}{You know, I'm wearing this armor not just for kicks.}
{181}{019}{你知道，我穿这件盔甲不仅仅是为了踢球。}

### {190}{}{Yeah... Sure... [Catty still looks nervous. She makes sure no one is looking one more time, then sighs and silently hugs you] Oh Gods... I'm so glad to see you again. I never thought you'd survive... I've seen the guard's corpse. The wounds were... Scary. And he had armor on him, unlike you. And that damn guards still think that it was you who killed him. They have their brains completely murky from all of the booze...}
{190}{}{是 啊当然[凯蒂看起来仍然很紧张。她确保没有人再看一次，然后叹了口气，默默地拥抱你]哦，天哪。。。很高兴再次见到你。我从没想过你能活下来。。。我见过警卫的尸体。伤口是。。。恐怖的他身上有盔甲，不像你。那些该死的警卫仍然认为是你杀了他。他们的大脑因酗酒而变得完全模糊。。。}
### {191}{}{Can we talk safely here?}
{191}{}{我们能在这里安全地交谈吗？}

### {200}{}{Sure, I think. If there's no load of guards around, then everything's alright. Your disguise is working. [She takes a few steps back, calming down, and sits on the rusty pile of heap] You know, I still can't believe my eyes. I'm so glad to see you! But I'm still willing to unscrew that head of yours for so mindlessly wandering in here like you are the favorite of Gods... [she glances over you] Damn! I want to talk about so many things... I... I don't know where to start! [she stops for a moment] How are you doing? Tell me what you went through after running off. And then I'll tell you how we are doing here. }
{200}{}{当然，我想。如果周围没有警卫，那么一切都会好起来的。你的伪装奏效了。[她退了几步，平静下来，坐在那堆锈迹斑斑的堆上]你知道，我仍然不敢相信自己的眼睛。见到你我很高兴！但我还是愿意拧下你的头，因为你在这里如此无意识地游荡，就像你是上帝的宠儿。。。[她瞥了你一眼]该死！我想谈很多事情。。。我…我不知道从哪里开始！[她停了一会儿]你好吗？告诉我你逃跑后经历了什么。然后我告诉你我们在这里过得怎么样。}

### {210}{}{[her hands start shaking]}
{210}{}{[她的手开始发抖]}
### {211}{014}{Oh come on, I'm just being silly. It's me! [remove the helmet, wink at her, then put it back]}
{211}{014}{哦，得了吧，我只是傻了。是我！[摘下头盔，向她眨眼，然后放回原处]}
### {212}{014}{This was a stupid joke, sorry, Catty, It's me... [remove the helmet, wink at her, then put it back]}
{212}{014}{这是个愚蠢的笑话，对不起，凯蒂，是我…[摘下头盔，向她眨眼，然后放回去]}

{221}{018}{[摘下头盔，向她眨眼，然后把它放回原处]}

### {230}{}{[Catty was never very girly in her manners, but now only her cute face reminds you that she is a woman.

### {231}{024}{Catty?}
{231}{024}{凯蒂？}

### {240}{}{[she freezes, hearing your voice]}
{240}{}{[听到你的声音，她僵住了]}

{250}{}{这是。。。你我很高兴见到你！我甚至会拥抱你，但是。。。这是你盔甲上的血吗？哦，那是你靴子上的大脑吗？}
### {251}{026}{Huh... That was not the way I envisioned our meeting.}
{251}{026}{嗯。。。这不是我预想的我们会面的方式。}

### {260}{}{You tell me. Listen, you made too much noise, standing up to the Sons of Gods. You know I don't approve of it, while I agree that they are wrong about putting that guard's murder on you. Still, looks like it doesn't really matter now. [she looks around] I'm not even sure it's safe here anymore. It's quite the opposite - I'm sure it's not safe here. Let's talk after this nightmare is over. [Catty takes your hand] I think I should hide, I know some places. Let's meet after it's over. [she runs off]}
{260}{}{你告诉我。听着，你站在众神之子面前，制造了太多的噪音。你知道我不赞成，但我同意他们把那个警卫的谋杀归咎于你是错误的。不过，现在看来这并不重要。[她环顾四周]我甚至不确定这里是否安全。恰恰相反――我确信这里不安全。噩梦结束后我们再谈吧。[凯蒂拉着你的手]我想我应该躲起来，我知道一些地方。我们结束后再见面。[她跑了]}
### {261}{999}{[end of dialogue]}
{261}{999}{[对话结束]}

### {270}{}{[she blushes and lowers her eyes] No, not at all. It's just... You were absent for a really long time. I thought you died. And... I started to think about my future, you know. You, uh, do get it, right?}
{270}{}{[她脸红了，低着眼睛]不，一点也不。只是。。。你缺席了很长一段时间。我以为你死了。和我开始考虑我的未来，你知道的。你，呃，明白了，对吧？}
### {271}{028}{And? Who is this dork?}
{271}{028}{和这个蠢蛋是谁？}
### {272}{029}{Yeah, I get it...}
{272}{029}{是的，我明白了。。。}

### {280}{}{No one. I didn't promise anything to anyone, and I'm glad you're back. Uh... You are staying, right? [she lights with hope, but interrupts herself] Yeah, sure you do. If some guard sees your face, you're done... Just know that whatever happens, I'll be here, waiting for you.}
{280}{}{没有人我没有答应任何人，我很高兴你回来了。嗯你要留下来，对吧？[她满怀希望地点着灯，但打断了自己]是的，你当然知道。如果有警卫看到你的脸，你就完了。。。只要知道无论发生什么，我都会在这里等你。}
### {281}{010}{[smile]}
{281}{010}{[微笑]}

### {290}{}{No you don't! [she giggles] I didn't promise anything to anyone, and I'm glad you're back. Uh... You are staying, right? [she lights with hope, but interrupts herself] Yeah, sure you do. If some guard sees your face, you're done... Just know that whatever happens, I'll be here, waiting for you.}
{290}{}{不，你没有！[她咯咯地笑着]我没有向任何人承诺任何事情，我很高兴你回来了。嗯你要留下来，对吧？[她满怀希望地点着灯，但打断了自己]是的，你当然知道。如果有警卫看到你的脸，你就完了。。。只要知道无论发生什么，我都会在这里等你。}
### {291}{010}{[smile]}
{291}{010}{[微笑]}

### {300}{}{You know, nothing special, since we've met last time. It's the same... Nothing is going on.}
{300}{}{你知道，没有什么特别的，因为我们上次见过面。这是一样的。。。什么也没发生。}
### {301}{}{[she lowers her eyes] Lately, the Sons of Gods require sacrifices. The guards just grab women and take them away at least once every two weeks. And we have only one who returned, but she doesn't speak and behaves strangely. Doc said she has bruises on her back, arms, and legs... I... I'm scared. I try not to think much, but I am scared.}
{301}{}{[她低着眼睛]最近，众神之子需要献祭。警卫每两周至少抓一次女人并带走她们。我们只有一个人回来了，但她说话和行为都很奇怪。医生说她背部、手臂和腿部都有淤青。。。我…我很害怕。我尽量不想太多，但我很害怕。}
### {302}{}{Do you remember me telling you about the guards taking women away? Looks like even Sons of Gods themselves started to take advantage of it. My friend, Claire, ran away from Tartarus after Herald's harassment. I doubt she made it alive... But scarier is to think what Herald did to her.}
{302}{}{你还记得我告诉过你警卫带走女人的事吗？看来连众神之子自己也开始利用它了。我的朋友克莱尔在《先驱报》的骚扰后逃离了塔尔塔罗斯。我怀疑她是否活着。。。但更可怕的是想想《先驱报》对她做了什么。}
### {303}{}{[Catty gives you a weak smile] The life gets worse, the food is scarce, the water is dirtier, fewer children around... Do you want me to go on?}
{303}{}{[凯蒂微弱地笑了笑]生活越来越糟糕，食物匮乏，水越来越脏，周围的孩子越来越少。。。你想让我继续吗？}
### {304}{010}{Well... The stability isn't so bad. Better than worsening, at least.}
{304}{010}{好稳定性还不错。至少比恶化要好。}
### {305}{010}{Yeah, the stability sucks, when it's consistently bad.}
{305}{010}{是的，稳定性很差，当它一直很糟糕的时候。}
### {306}{031}{That assholes... I'll cut their balls off!}
{306}{031}{那个混蛋。。。我要把他们的蛋蛋切掉！}
### {307}{032}{It could be worse. Good that they didn't come for you.}
{307}{032}{情况可能会更糟。很高兴他们没有来找你。}
### {308}{031}{Herald is a petty bitch who thinks he's the hand of Gods. I'll deal with him eventually.}
{308}{031}{先驱是个卑鄙的婊子，他认为自己是上帝之手。我最终会对付他的。}
### {309}{032}{Just keep away from him, okay?}
{309}{032}{离他远点，好吗？}
### {3010}{032}{Catty, we'll make it through. It's not the first time.}
{3010}{032}{凯蒂，我们会挺过去的。这不是第一次了。}
### {3011}{031}{It's all because of these dicks living on the upper floors of Olympus. And soon everything is going to change...}
{3011}{031}{这一切都是因为这些住在奥林巴斯楼上的白痴。很快一切都会改变。。。}

### {310}{}{Don't start a fight you can't win.}
{310}{}{不要挑起一场你赢不了的仗。}
### {311}{010}{Sure, sure... Let's talk about something else.}
{311}{010}{当然，当然。。。让我们谈谈其他事情。}
### {312}{999}{If you say so.}
{312}{999}{如果你这么说的话。}

### {320}{}{Thanks for the support. I think we'll make it somehow. If only you could return to Tartarus as its dweller...}
{320}{}{感谢您的支持。我想我们一定会成功的。如果你能回到塔尔塔罗斯作为它的居民就好了。。。}
### {321}{033}{This day will come, I assure you.}
{321}{033}{我向你保证，这一天会到来的。}
### {322}{034}{Rather, as its God.}
{322}{034}{相反，作为它的上帝。}
### {323}{034}{As a Servant? Hell no.}
{323}{034}{作为仆人？当然不是。}

### {330}{}{Looks like I whine too much. Everything is not so bad, right? We are alive and well. [she gives you a tired smile]}
{330}{}{看起来我发牢骚太多了。一切都没那么糟糕，对吧？我们还活着，身体很好。[她疲惫地笑了笑]}
### {331}{010}{Let's talk about something else.}
{331}{010}{让我们谈谈其他事情。}

### {340}{}{When did you get so much arrogance in you? [she sighs] Okay, at least don't do anything stupid.}
{340}{}{你什么时候变得如此傲慢的？[她叹了口气]好吧，至少别做傻事。}
### {341}{010}{Right. Let's talk about something else.}
{341}{010}{正确的让我们谈谈其他事情。}

### {350}{}{You know, he held on for as long as he could, but... It seems he was far too insignificant to waste rare medical supplies on him. The guards went to doc right after your escape. As far as I know, they considered making an example out of your father, throwing him into the Mouth of Hades, as he was the one responsible for the birth of violator - that is you. Doc managed to defend him, I don't even know how... But he still didn't get the necessary meds for treating John. I tried to help, but... Didn't help much.}
{350}{}{你知道，他坚持了很长时间，但是。。。他似乎太微不足道了，不能把稀有的医疗用品浪费在他身上。你逃跑后警卫马上去找医生。据我所知，他们曾考虑以你父亲为榜样，把他扔进地狱之口，因为他是违法者――也就是你――出生的罪魁祸首。医生设法为他辩护，我甚至不知道怎么。。。但他仍然没有得到治疗约翰所需的药物。我试图帮忙，但是。。。帮不了什么忙。}
### {351}{999}{I should think it over. [end of dialogue]}
{351}{999}{我应该好好想想。[对话结束]}
### {352}{010}{I need... Let's talk about something else.}

### {362}{038}{Do you know what Livos is?}
{362}{038}{你知道利沃斯是什么吗？}
### {363}{039}{Did you know that there are settlements where everyone is treated equally, and where the leader is someone of its inhabitants?}
{363}{039}{你知道吗，在有些定居点，每个人都受到平等对待，领导人是其居民中的某个人？}
### {364}{044}{Look who I have here!}
{364}{044}{看看我这里有谁！}
### {365}{047}{Did you hear about the Rainbow?}
{365}{047}{你听说彩虹了吗？}
### {366}{048}{Did you hear about the Drop?}
{366}{048}{你听说Drop了吗？}
### {367}{050}{Catty... I did it! I got inside the Olympus!}
{367}{050}{凯蒂。。。我做到了！我进了奥林匹斯山！}
### {368}{010}{I, uh... Don't think there was anything interesting lately. Better let's talk about what's happening here.}
{368}{010}{I、 呃。。。不要认为最近有什么有趣的事情。最好让我们谈谈这里发生了什么。}

### {370}{}{Cool! I guess... Do you have something else interesting to tell me?}
{370}{}{凉的我想。。。你还有什么有趣的事要告诉我吗？}
### {371}{036}{Of course!}

### {372}{010}{Enough for today! [wink at her] Let's talk about something else.}
{372}{010}{今天就够了！[向她眨眼]我们谈谈别的事情吧。}

### {380}{}{No. Is it some kind of God?}
{380}{}{不，是某种上帝吗？}
### {381}{041}{[laugh] No, it's a place. Maybe you didn't see the Chimeras, but you must have heard of them. Nasty creatures. And I had to fight one of these... [tell about your battle with Chimera]}
{381}{041}{[[笑]不，那是个地方。也许你没有见过奇美拉，但你一定听说过它们。讨厌的生物。我不得不和其中一个。。。[讲述你与奇美拉的战斗]}
### {382}{010}{Yeah... You know, I'll tell you about it later. Let's talk about more recent things.}
{382}{010}{是 啊你知道，我稍后会告诉你的。让我们谈谈最近的事情。}

### {390}{}{Really? What about the Gods?}
{390}{}{真正地那众神呢？}
### {391}{040}{The Gods, they... Uh... They don't have the power there. So, I ended up in such a place when they were in the process of changing their leader!}
{391}{040}{众神，他们。。。嗯他们在那里没有权力。所以，当他们正在更换他们的领导人时，我最终来到了这样一个地方！}

### {400}{}{And? How they did it? Did the Herald come to tell them who is worthy of leading people?}
{400}{}{和他们是怎么做到的？《先驱报》是来告诉他们谁值得领导人们的吗？}
### {401}{041}{You will be surprised - to chose someone they had to cast a vote, each of them. And the most interesting part - they voted for a rotten ghoul, named Sam. }
{401}{041}{你会感到惊讶――选择一个他们必须投票的人，他们每个人。最有趣的是，他们投票给了一个叫萨姆的腐烂的食尸鬼。}
### {402}{042}{Yes... And Herald fell to his knees and told that I'm the savior of the Radius. So, now I'm the leader of that town.}
{402}{042}{对Herald跪了下来，告诉我我是Radius的救世主。所以，现在我是那个城镇的领导人。}
### {403}{042}{No, it's not... It's not like... Long story short, I'm their leader now.}
{403}{042}{不，不是。。。这不像。。。长话短说，我现在是他们的领袖。}

### {410}{}{What?! [she stares at you as if you said something stupid]}
{410}{}{什么[她盯着你看，好像你说了什么愚蠢的话]}
### {411}{037}{[tell her details]}
{411}{037}{[告诉她细节]}

### {420}{}{Are you... A God now?}
{420}{}{你是。。。现在是上帝了？}
### {421}{043}{No, I'm just the town manager. A mayor, not a God. Like if I were to become in charge around here.}
{421}{043}{不，我只是镇经理。市长，而不是上帝。就像我要掌管这里一样。}

### {432}{010}{Uhh... Forget it... Let's talk about something else. }
{432}{010}{嗯。。。算了……让我们谈谈别的吧。}

### {440}{}{[Catty pulls back at first, but then suddenly shines with a smile] It's a doggie!}
{440}{}{[凯蒂一开始后退，但突然露出笑容]这是一只小狗！}
### {441}{045}{Yeah, he sure looks like it... Just like in our children's books about Lassie. [observe Catty playing with a Fire Wolf]}
{441}{045}{是的，他看起来确实很像…就像我们的儿童读物中关于莱西的一样。[观察凯蒂与火狼玩耍]}

### {450}{}{Fantastic! Where did you get him?}
{450}{}{好极了你从哪里找到他的？}
### {451}{046}{There was one place... Doesn't matter. He's great, right?}
{451}{046}{有一个地方。。。没关系。他很棒，对吧？}
### {452}{046}{In NWO. It's pretty far. [smile and tell her about how you've met Shaggy]}
{452}{046}{在NWO。它很远。[微笑着告诉她你是如何认识Shaggy的]}

### {460}{}{He is so cute! Do you have something else to tell me? I would play with him while you do it. [you notice that Shaggy is actively wagging his tail]}
{460}{}{他太可爱了！你还有什么要告诉我的吗？你玩的时候我会和他一起玩。[你注意到沙吉在积极地摇尾巴]}

{470}{}{你是说，海里的东西？我看过照片。。。}
### {471}{037}{It's also the name of one place... Pretty far away from here. There are some pretty bad people living in there. And they had a big and dumb guy in charge, an evil bandit by the name of Hog... [tell her about you dealing with Hog]}
{471}{037}{这也是一个地方的名字。。。离这里很远。那里住着一些非常坏的人。他们有一个又大又笨的家伙负责，一个名叫霍的邪恶土匪。。。[告诉她你和霍格打交道的事]}

{472}{010}{是 啊我看到了一个，你能想象吗？好吧，让我们谈谈更简单的事情。。。}

### {480}{}{No. What is it?}
{480}{}{不，是什么？}
### {481}{049}{It's a drug. Poison. And its creator was... You can say, a slave, who was forced to produce it. I helped her escape. If you only knew how risky it was... [tell about Naomi and her lab]}
{481}{049}{这是一种毒品。毒药它的创造者是。。。你可以说，一个奴隶，被迫生产它。我帮助她逃跑了。如果你知道它有多危险。。。[讲述Naomi和她的实验室]}

### {490}{}{Naomi? Did something happen between the two of you?}
{490}{}{娜奥米？你们俩之间发生了什么事吗？}
### {491}{}{Cool! I guess... Do you have more interesting stories to tell? }

### {500}{}{Did you meet the Gods? }
{500}{}{你见过上帝吗？}
### {501}{051}{I... Listen, Catty, there are no Gods. Only people who pretend to be Gods. Only people... Living in the tower. Well, maybe some of them are little nuts, but that's beside the point. We can overthrow them, Catty! I'm close to it!}
{501}{051}{我…听着，凯蒂，世上没有神。只有那些假扮成神的人。只有人。。。住在塔里。好吧，也许他们中的一些人是小疯子，但这与重点无关。我们可以推翻他们，凯蒂！我快到了！}

{540}{}{然后会发生什么？谁来保护我们？从你告诉我的情况来看，外面的世界很危险！}
### {541}{053}{I will! I saw the world. It is not as dangerous as the guards killing the local dwellers and raping our women. }

### {542}{999}{[leave silently]}
{542}{999}{[默默地离开]}

### {550}{}{Nothing special. At first, the guards were pretty tense... But then everybody started to act like you were never here. It's... Depressing. Other dwellers seemingly didn't pay attention to your disappearance. And the days went by... You know, waking up, getting daily duties from Herald. Usual stuff. }
{550}{}{没什么特别的。起初，警卫很紧张。。。但后来每个人都开始表现得好像你从来没有来过一样。这是。。。压抑。其他居民似乎没有注意到你的失踪。日子一天天过去了……你知道，醒来后，从《先驱报》那里得到日常工作。普通的东西。}
### {551}{010}{Yeah. Well, let's talk about something else.}
{551}{010}{是 啊好吧，让我们谈谈其他事情。}
