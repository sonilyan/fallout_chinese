#{100}{}{You see the Jolly Joe.}
{100}{}{你看到了快乐的乔。}
#{101}{}{You see a very funny bald guy with the everlasting smile and protruding teeth. If not for clothing, you would've thought that he is crazy.}
{101}{}{你看到一个非常有趣的秃头男人，他永远微笑着，牙齿突出。如果不是为了衣服，你会认为他疯了。}

#{109}{}{A new face in our venue? Make yourself comfortable! There is no such bar in the world, where you can sit for long without buying some alcohol and getting drunk. And for this we do our job! Choose, what would you like?}
{109}{}{新面孔出现在我们的场地？让自己舒服点！世界上没有这样的酒吧，在那里你可以坐很长时间而不必买酒和喝醉。为此我们尽我们的职责！选择，你想要什么？}
#{110}{}{Well, what do you want for a drink?}
{110}{}{你想喝点什么？}
#{111}{}{Show me what you have.}
{111}{}{给我看看你有什么。}
#{112}{}{Nothing, I'm leaving.}
{112}{}{没什么，我要走了。}
#{113}{}{I'd like to complain about your waitress. She was rude to me!}
{113}{}{我想投诉你的女招待。她对我很粗鲁！}
#{114}{}{Ow! Come on! She's a cool old lady. Everyone here is crazy about her, and you will soon love her too. Relax!}
{114}{}{噢！加油！她是个很酷的老太太。这里的每个人都为她疯狂，你很快也会爱上她的。放松点！}
#{115}{}{W-well, whatever...}
{115}{}{不管怎样...}

#{122}{}{No, I ran in for a couple of minutes, to guzzle a mug of beer, Joe.}
{122}{}{不，我跑了几分钟，喝了一杯啤酒，乔。}
#{123}{}{No, I ran in for a couple of minutes, to guzzle a mug of beer, Joe.}
{123}{}{不，我跑了几分钟，喝了一杯啤酒，乔。}

{124}{}{我会不时来看看。再见！}
#{125}{}{Yes, [vigorously shakes head] I understand! To hit the road again, to save the Wasteland from the dirty bastards! I'm so happy that such valiant people like yourself still visit our region occasionally.}
{125}{}{是的，[使劲摇头]我明白！再次上路，从肮脏的混蛋手中拯救荒地！我很高兴像你这样勇敢的人仍然偶尔来我们地区。}
#{126}{}{Sure, the world is not without good people...}
{126}{}{当然，这个世界不是没有好人...}
#{127}{}{Sure. And I also would like to make you pleased. [Pulls out a pair of glasses, and a moldy bottle] You wouldn't believe how old this drink is. It's a great luck to come across something like this in the Wasteland. But lucky me, I snatched one box for a reasonable price. However, it is almost all consumed already. Here, I want to drink to your well-being.}
{127}{}{当然。我也想让你高兴。[拿出一副玻璃杯和一个发霉的瓶子]你不会相信这饮料有多老。在荒地里遇到这样的东西真是太幸运了。但幸运的是，我以合理的价格抢了一盒。然而，它几乎已经全部被消耗掉了。在这里，我想为你的幸福干杯。}
#{128}{}{[More]}
{128}{}{[更多]}
#{129}{}{[You spend some time, listening to fascinating stories of Joe, with a bottle of delicious whiskey] ...so that's how we got rid of that Deathclaw. Scary, right?}
{129}{}{[你花了一些时间，听着乔的迷人故事，喝着一瓶美味的威士忌]……所以我们就这样摆脱了那只死爪。吓人，对吧？}
#{130}{}{Oh, Joe, everything is much simpler with those Deathclaws. But I think you already know this, if you met the thing face to face. Hmm?}
{130}{}{哦，乔，有了这些死爪，一切都简单多了。但我想你已经知道这一点了，如果你面对面的话。隐马尔可夫模型？}
#{131}{}{Uh... Yeah! Uh... Of Course. Of course, I know all about them. [looks at the bottle]... Um, you know... Hell, I admire you so much that I will give you this whole bottle. Here you go!}
{131}{}{Uh...是 啊！Uh...当然。当然，我对他们了如指掌。[看瓶子]...嗯，你知道...见鬼，我真佩服你，我就把这整瓶给你。干得好！}
#{132}{}{Wow, thanks for the rarity, Joe! I'll see you around. Bye.}
{132}{}{哇，谢谢你的珍品，乔！回头见。再见。}
#{140}{}{I want to ask you about the city.}
{140}{}{我想问你关于这个城市的事。}
#{141}{}{I want to buy a drink for everyone in here to introduce myself.}
{141}{}{我想买杯酒给在座的各位自我介绍一下。}
#{142}{}{Not right now, buddy. Did you met working trains here somewhere?}
{142}{}{现在不行，伙计。你在这里什么地方见过工作火车吗？}
#{143}{}{Sorry, but taking your reputation into account, it won't help you.}
{143}{}{对不起，但考虑到你的名声，这对你没有帮助。}
#{144}{}{Damn!}
{144}{}{该死！}
#{145}{}{A great way to introduce yourself to the city! Put out 200 bucks, and everyone here will find out who you really are.}
{145}{}{向城市自我介绍的好方法！拿出200块，这里的每个人都会知道你到底是谁。}

{146}{}{这是钱。嘿，伙计们，我请客！为了大家！}
#{147}{}{Uh, actually I want to ask you about the city.}
{147}{}{呃，实际上我想问你关于这个城市的事。}
#{148}{}{Not today. Bye.}
{148}{}{今天不行。再见。}
#{149}{}{A good idea to start with, but trust me - in this city you won't build reputation only by buying everyone a beer. Start small.}
{149}{}{一开始是个好主意，但相信我――在这个城市，你不会仅仅通过给每个人买啤酒来建立声誉。从小处着手。}
#{150}{}{Thanks for the tip, Joe.}
{150}{}{谢谢你的小费，乔。}
#{151}{}{Oh, that's the reason why I'm wearing out the seat of my pants here everyday!}
{151}{}{哦，这就是为什么我每天都在这里穿裤子的原因！}
#{152}{}{Who runs this place?}
{152}{}{谁经营这个地方？}
#{153}{}{Is this place run by the law?}
{153}{}{这个地方是依法经营的吗？}

{154}{}{这个绞刑架经常是空的吗？}
#{155}{}{Where can I patch up myself or my equipment?}
{155}{}{我在哪里可以修补我自己或我的设备？}
#{156}{}{Can you tell me more about the area?}
{156}{}{你能告诉我更多关于这个地区的情况吗？}
#{157}{}{Why there are so many caravaneers here?}
{157}{}{为什么这里有这么多商队？}
#{158}{}{Okay, let's quit the chatter.}
{158}{}{好吧，我们别聊了。}
#{159}{}{I see. Can I ask another question?}
{159}{}{我懂了。我能再问一个问题吗？}
#{160}{}{I guess it's the Sheriff. He has everyone's asses on a string - thus, no skunk will dare to show its face in here. Oh, yeah.}
{160}{}{我猜是警长。他把每个人的屁股都拴在绳子上――因此，没有臭鼬敢在这里露脸。哦，是的。}
#{161}{}{The Sheriff is the law. All will be as he says.}
{161}{}{治安官就是法律。一切都会如他所说。}
#{162}{}{Come back around afternoon, when it's not too dark yet. Usually, at that time they feed the new victims of the show to the audience. Funny guys they are.}
{162}{}{下午左右回来，天还不太黑。通常，在那个时候，他们把节目的新受害者喂给观众。他们真有趣。}
#{163}{}{Well, you can get a kick out of vending machines or buy some grub, the Quok brothers across the street sell equipment and the technician from the Nuka-Cola factory will help you to cope with broken inventory. In the North, in front of the Sheriff's office, there is a pharmacist, however, lately there's almost nothing left to buy from him. Also, you may stay in the hotel, when the weakness is about to floor you.}
{163}{}{好吧，你可以从自动售货机中得到乐趣，或者买一些食物，街对面的Quok兄弟卖设备，Nuka可乐厂的技术人员会帮你处理残缺的库存。在北部，在警长办公室前，有一个药剂师，然而，最近几乎没有东西可以从他那里买了。另外，你也可以住在酒店里，当你的弱点即将来临的时候。}
#{164}{}{[He sighs, apparently, he's tired of this question] Oh, God... It's the business center. If you need some equipment or want to relax - come here. The factory of Nuka-Cola is to the East, and further in that direction is the canyon of the wastewater. To the North there is the residential area where the Sheriff's office is located. Overall, it is better not to wander around because of radiation, wild dogs, acid geckos... And many other hostile abominations.}
{164}{}{[他叹了口气，显然，他厌倦了这个问题]哦，上帝...是商务中心。如果你需要一些设备或者想放松-过来。努卡可乐的工厂在东边，再往那个方向就是废水峡谷。北面是警长办公室所在的居民区。总的来说，最好不要因为辐射、野狗、酸壁虎而四处游荡...以及许多其他可憎的敌对行为。}
#{165}{}{In recent years Salt Lake has attracted more entrepreneurs than usual. This was, you know, just the right moment to line your pockets up with cash. Those, who realized this in time, have bent the entire potential of the city to their interests. That's why the city still has what to offer to other settlements.}
{165}{}{近年来，盐湖城吸引了比以往更多的企业家。你知道，这正是你口袋里装满现金的时候。那些及时意识到这一点的人，已经将这座城市的全部潜力转向了他们的利益。这就是为什么这座城市还可以为其他定居点提供什么。}
#{166}{}{[Suddenly everyone around you falls silent and turns to you] What are you talking about?}
{166}{}{[突然你周围的人都安静下来，转向你]你在说什么？}
#{167}{}{Uh, I say, do you have a working train here? That can actually move, you know?}
{167}{}{呃，我说，你这儿有工作列车吗？它可以移动，你知道吗？}
#{168}{}{[Joe looks around the audience, his smile is draining from the face, becoming similar to a grin] No, we just have piles of rusty metal.}
{168}{}{[乔环顾着观众，他的笑容从脸上消失，变得像一个笑容]不，我们只有一堆生锈的金属。}
#{169}{}{But you do have a railroad, right?}
{169}{}{但你有铁路，对吗？}
#{170}{}{So?}
{170}{}{所以呢？}
#{171}{}{So tell me, where is the railway station with trains.}
{171}{}{告诉我，有火车的火车站在哪里。}
#{172}{}{[Lowers his voice, the smile slipping from his nervous face] Look, even I rarely dare to joke on this subject... Don't go there. And stop speaking about it.}
{172}{}{[压低声音，从他紧张的脸上滑落的微笑]看，就连我也很少敢拿这个话题开玩笑...不要去那里。别再说了。}
#{173}{}{Hey! Take it easy!}
{173}{}{嘿！别紧张！}
#{174}{}{Looks like you asked a wrong question. Something is off here...}
{174}{}{看来你问错问题了。这里有点不对劲...}
#{175}{}{Who is this guy that is hanging out by the entrance?}
{175}{}{在入口处闲逛的那个家伙是谁？}
#{176}{}{Incorrigible Ned? A walking bag full of guts. I wouldn't have to use a work of such a sloven, if only he didn't ask so little for his service. And I don't mind saving a few coins. Ha!}
{176}{}{不可救药的奈德？一个装满肠子的行囊。我不必用这样一个懒汉的作品，只要他对自己的服务要求不高就好了。我不介意存几个硬币。哈！}

{180}{}{你们有什么花生酱？}
#{181}{}{Paste? Ah, yes, the paste of the Vocas nuts. The result of my culinary research. As you can see, a failed one.}
{181}{}{粘贴？啊，是的，是果仁酱。我烹饪研究的结果。正如你所看到的，一个失败的。}
#{182}{}{Why failed?}
{182}{}{为什么失败了？}
#{183}{}{Because this muck was too hard and acidic for the stomach. The technician from the factory had been buying it to use as a cleaning agent against rust, but then he started to cook it himself when learned the recipe. Shit...}
{183}{}{因为这些淤泥对胃来说太硬太酸了。工厂的技术员一直在买它来做除锈剂，但当他知道了配方后，就开始自己煮了。倒霉...}
#{184}{}{Interesting. Would you share the recipe?}
{184}{}{很有趣。你能分享一下食谱吗？}
