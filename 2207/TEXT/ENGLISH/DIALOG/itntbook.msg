#Text file for writing to your personal notebook 
#Line number in scripts. lst << 61 >>

#File structure:
#line 1-9 - description of the character;
## lines 10-29 - getting to know the character;
# lines 30-99 - I don't know yet, but I think they will be useful...
#Further, along the branches of the dialog.
##Each branch is 100, i.e. 100 is one dialog topic, 200 is another.
# Character replicas go through 10, i.e. 100, 110, 120, etc. With what 
#for replica 100, use Node010, for replica 240-Node024.
#For player responses-end-to-end numbering, i.e. for replica 650, the responses will be 651, 652, 653, etc.
#For special branches, use additional digits (for example, replica 360 is divided into 3601 and 3602,
#the same applies to the Node procedure, the answers will be in the usual form-361, 362, etc.)
