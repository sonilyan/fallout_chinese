#{351}{}{I see you want your ass kicked.}
{351}{}{我知道你想被踢屁股。}

#{355}{}{I might not look it but I can kill you, no problem.}
{355}{}{我可能看不出来，但我可以杀了你，没问题。}

{700}{}{天堂之门，我就不会在这里呆太久了。}
#{701}{}{OK.}
{701}{}{好 啊。}
#{750}{}{Hey, what's the matter with you?}
{750}{}{嘿，你怎么了？}
#{751}{}{Goohe?}
{751}{}{古贺？}
#{800}{}{Damn, if we're to cover each other's back, you gotta stop overusing. I'm not going with you anywhere unless you're able to get together at least a single sentence.}
{800}{}{妈的，如果我们要保护对方的背部，你就不要过度使用。我哪儿也不跟你去，除非你至少能凑齐一句话。}
#{801}{}{Uff.}

#{850}{}{So, you sobered up?}

#{1106}{}{Wait here until I return.}

#{1207}{}{Thanks, that'll be all.}
{1207}{}{谢谢，就这些。}
#{1250}{}{Sure, let's do that.}
{1250}{}{当然，让我们这样做。}
#{1251}{}{What can you do?}
{1251}{}{你能做什么？}
#{1252}{}{Holster your weapon.}
{1252}{}{把你的枪套起来。}
#{1253}{}{I want to talk about the armor you're wearing.}
{1253}{}{我想谈谈你穿的盔甲。}
#{1254}{}{In fact, I need something else from you.}
{1254}{}{事实上，我还需要你做点别的。}
#{1300}{}{I'm best with knives of all kinds, including the throwing ones, but I don't shy away from other melee weapons, or small arms. If there isn't too much strength required to operate a weapon, I can kill with it. But most importantly, I've spent most of my life around caravans, so I know quite a lot about bartering. I know loads of haggling tricks. A little remark about the quality of the goods or the respectability of the other side can do wonders sometimes... But you don't have to trouble yourself with all that. Even if you'll be in charge of business, I'll make sure we get a little discount without you even noticing.}
{1300}{}{我最擅长使用各种刀，包括投掷刀，但我不回避其他近战武器，或小武器。如果操作武器不需要太大的力量，我可以用它杀人。但最重要的是，我一生的大部分时间都在商队里度过，所以我对物物交换很了解。我知道很多讨价还价的把戏。对货物的质量或对方的信誉稍加评论，有时会产生奇迹。。。但你不必为这些麻烦自己。即使你负责生意，我也保证在你不注意的情况下给我们一点折扣。}
#{1301}{}{Holster your weapon.}
{1301}{}{把你的枪套起来。}
#{1302}{}{I want to talk about the armor you're wearing.}

#{1304}{}{Thanks for the clarification, that's all for now.}
{1304}{}{谢谢你的澄清，现在就这些。}
#{1350}{}{OK. But I'm ready to draw at any moment.}
{1350}{}{好 啊。但我随时准备画画。}
#{1351}{}{Tell me about your skills.}
{1351}{}{告诉我你的技能。}
#{1352}{}{I also wanted to talk about the armor you're wearing.}

#{1354}{}{That's all.}
{1354}{}{这就是全部。}
#{1400}{}{Look, I want to tell you straight away that I'm not keen on taking off my favorite leather jacket. There's no way I'll wear some shit that weighs as much as a pregnant brahmin, makes you sweat like one, and doesn't offer much more in terms of protection.}
{1400}{}{听着，我想马上告诉你我不想脱我最喜欢的皮夹克。我不可能穿上和怀孕的双头牛一样重的东西，让你像双头牛一样出汗，而且不能提供更多的保护。}
#{1401}{}{So no metal or leather armors?}
{1401}{}{所以没有金属或皮革盔甲？}

#{1450}{}{Spot on. I'm glad we understand each other.}
{1450}{}{当场。我很高兴我们互相理解。}

#{1800}{}{People call them cops because it sounds good, but in truth, they're mercenaries. They don't lift an eyebrow without a solid sum of cash. It's true that the town council controls them with regular salaries, but if one of the companies needs a favor from them, it's easier to throw in some extra cash instead of hoping the council will agree on something. The sheriff's gotten awfully rich because of that. Just look at his villa and you'll know what I mean.}
{1800}{}{人们叫他们警察是因为听起来不错，但事实上，他们是雇佣军。如果没有一大笔现金，他们是不会扬眉吐气的。的确，市议会用固定的工资来控制他们，但是如果其中一家公司需要他们的帮助，投入一些额外的现金就更容易了，而不是希望市议会同意一些事情。警长因此变得非常富有。只要看看他的别墅，你就会明白我的意思。}

#{2000}{}{Corath exists because it has an iron ore mine. The mine's the center of everything, the whole town is here to ensure continuous extraction. And that's also the only reason Uncle and Nestor fight for control over the town.}
{2000}{}{科拉斯的存在是因为它有一个铁矿。矿山是一切的中心，整个城镇都在这里，以确保持续开采。这也是叔叔和内斯特争夺控制权的唯一原因。}

{2006}{}{谢谢你的信息。}
#{2050}{}{You bet your ass I can't. I've never been here. Never wanted to. I only know what the caravan guards used to tell. I remember one more thing. People solve any issues here by fighting to death in a ring instead of on the streets. For some reason, they think it makes them better, somehow. Idiots.}
{2050}{}{你敢打赌我不能。我从没来过这里。从没想过。我只知道商队的守卫们过去常说些什么。我还记得一件事。在这里，人们解决任何问题都是在斗殴场上而不是在大街上战斗到死亡。出于某种原因，他们认为这会让他们变得更好。白痴。}

#{2100}{}{Based on what caravan guards'd told me, the descendants of the original inhabitants of Vault 16 live in their own closed part of the city, where they keep boosting each other's egos with ideas of their own superiority over the rest of the world. The rest of the place is run by the Mutant Hunters who seek to eliminate every single soul even remotely reminding them of a mutant. They're a bunch of fanatics and killers, but you have to give them one thing. Without them, the city'd be a smoldering pile of ash by now.}
{2100}{}{根据商队警卫告诉我的，16号地下室原始居民的后代住在他们自己封闭的城市里，在那里他们不断地用自己优于世界其他地方的想法来提升彼此的自尊。其余的地方都是由变种猎人经营的，他们试图消灭每一个灵魂，哪怕只是一点点地提醒他们一个变种人。他们是一群狂热分子和杀手，但你必须给他们一样东西。如果没有他们，这个城市现在将是一堆灰烬。}

#{2282}{}{In fact, I need something else from you.}
{2282}{}{事实上，我还需要你做点别的。}
#{2350}{}{You have to understand that the Hub was home to many who loved it and its destruction was hard for some of them. Demetre was one of them. Not that he hadn't been a looney before that, but he'd never used to be so intolerable. If Tadeus' death will do him good, I say go for it.}
{2350}{}{你必须明白，这个中心是许多热爱它的人的家，它的毁灭对他们中的一些人来说是艰难的。德米特里就是其中之一。并不是说他在那之前不是个疯子，但他从来没有像现在这样难以忍受过。如果塔迪斯的死对他有好处，我说去吧。}
#{2351}{}{Tell me about the destruction of the Hub.}
{2351}{}{告诉我中心的破坏情况。}
#{2352}{}{I have another question.}
{2352}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{2353}{}{That's all I need to hear right now.}
{2353}{}{我现在只想听这些。}
#{2400}{}{The supermutants attacked the Hub without any strategy. They just flooded over the town like a massive unstoppable wave of flesh. Those motherfuckers went right through walls of buildings and barricades, withstanding gunfire. And when one of them went down under it, the rest of them dragged him along in front of them like a shield and weapon combined. After a few minutes, it was clear that the Hub was finished. Those of us who managed to survive for that long started to run and the supermutants went after us like hounds after their prey. Only some of us managed to escape. Is this sufficient? If not, your problem. I'm not willing to spend another fucking second talking about this.}
{2400}{}{超级变种人毫无策略地袭击了这个中心。他们就像一股势不可挡的巨浪一样淹没了整个城镇。那些混蛋顶住了枪声，穿过了建筑物和路障的墙壁。当他们中的一个下到它下面时，其余的人像盾牌和武器一样把他拖到他们面前。几分钟后，很明显，枢纽已经完工。我们中那些设法活了那么长时间的人开始逃跑，超级变种人像猎犬一样追逐猎物。只有我们中的一些人设法逃脱了。这足够吗？如果不是，你的问题。我不想再花一秒钟谈这个了。}
#{2401}{}{I have another question.}
{2401}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{2402}{}{That's all I need to hear right now.}
{2402}{}{我现在只想听这些。}
#{2450}{}{I hope you took that hypo with FEV only so you could kill him without any fuss.}
{2450}{}{我希望你带着FEV去拿hypo，这样你就可以毫不费力地杀了他。}
#{2451}{}{Exactly. I was bluffing. But didn't he seem weird to you?}
{2451}{}{确切地。我在虚张声势。但你不觉得他很奇怪吗？}
#{2452}{}{In truth, I'm thinking of injecting it to Demetre.}
{2452}{}{事实上，我想把它注射到德米特里。}
#{2500}{}{What did you expect? No one with all their marbles in one heap could work with the Master on that madness of his. The world's a slightly better place now that another Child of the Cathedral is gone.}
{2500}{}{你期望什么？没有人能把所有的弹珠都堆在一堆里，和主人一起对付他那疯狂的行为。现在世界稍微好一点了，因为大教堂的另一个孩子走了。}
#{2501}{}{As you think.}
{2501}{}{如你所想。}
#{2550}{}{Hell, I hope you're fucking kidding me! You better beat that idiotic idea outta your head before I do it for you.}

#{2701}{}{[Defend yourself.]}
{2701}{}{[为自己辩护。]}
#{2750}{}{I doubt Johny will agree with this; Demetre wouldn't like it. People didn't mind living side by side with ghouls in the Hub, but since it's been destroyed, people look with hatred at all mutants, including ghouls. And my idiotic father is one of them.}
{2750}{}{我怀疑约翰尼会同意这一点；德米特里不会喜欢的。人们并不介意在中心与僵尸并肩生活，但自从它被摧毁后，人们对包括僵尸在内的所有变种人都怀恨在心。我愚蠢的父亲就是其中之一。}
#{2751}{}{And what chances do they have with one of the other companies?}
{2751}{}{他们和其他公司有什么机会？}
#{2800}{}{Damn, I haven't got a clue. I've never took much interest in ghoul tourism.}
{2800}{}{妈的，我一点头绪都没有。我对僵尸旅游从来没有太大兴趣。}
#{2801}{}{I have another question.}
{2801}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{2802}{}{That's all I need to hear right now.}
{2802}{}{我现在只想听这些。}
#{2850}{}{An obvious trap for Frederyk, you can bet your ass on that. They want to lure him away from his people so they can... I dunno. Teach him a lesson, make him do something or just plain kill him straight.}
{2850}{}{这对弗雷德里克来说是个明显的陷阱，你敢打赌。他们想把他从他的人那里引诱出来这样他们就可以。。。我不知道。教训他，让他做点什么，或者干脆直接杀了他。}
#{2851}{}{So you think I shouldn't send Frederyk to that meeting?}
{2851}{}{所以你认为我不应该派弗雷德里克去参加那个会议？}
#{2852}{}{I'll send him there, it looks like an easy way to ingratiate Sedit Caravan. What do you say?}
{2852}{}{我会送他去的，这看起来是讨好塞迪特商队的一个简单方法。你怎么说？}
#{2900}{}{That's your decision. As far as I'm concerned, I don't give a damn which company you want to help. They can't compete with the Crimson Caravan, they're too yellow to send caravans along the routes Demetre does.}
{2900}{}{那是你的决定。就我而言，我不在乎你想帮助哪家公司。他们不能和深红色的商队竞争，他们太黄了，不能让商队沿着德米特里的路线前进。}
#{2901}{}{Why do you care so much for the Crimson Caravan? I thought you didn't want to work for a caravan company anymore.}
{2901}{}{你为什么这么喜欢那辆深红色的大篷车？我以为你不想再为大篷车公司工作了。}
#{2902}{}{Why do you care so much for the Crimson Caravan? I thought you didn't want to work for a caravan company anymore.}
{2902}{}{你为什么这么喜欢那辆深红色的大篷车？我以为你不想再为大篷车公司工作了。}

#{2904}{}{That's all I need to hear right now.}
{2904}{}{我现在只想听这些。}
#{2950}{}{I wanted a change. That, however, doesn't mean I won't take over my father's company once his clumsiness gets him killed.}
{2950}{}{我想改变一下。然而，这并不意味着一旦我父亲的笨拙让他丧命，我就不会接管他的公司。}
#{2951}{}{I have another question.}
{2951}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{2952}{}{That's all I need to hear right now.}
{2952}{}{我现在只想听这些。}
#{3000}{}{That's hardly surprising, Nicol wants to get rid of the competition. Sending you with an invitation was a nice touch, I gotta give her that. Sending someone from Sedit Caravan would've been too obvious, but you have no ties to the company. Frederyk was never shaped for this business, it's a miracle he managed to last that long.}
{3000}{}{这并不奇怪，尼科尔想摆脱竞争。给你发请柬真是太好了，我得给她。从塞迪特商队派个人来可能太明显了，但你和公司没有关系。弗雷德里克从来就不是做这行的料，他能坚持这么久真是个奇迹。}
#{3001}{}{I have another question.}
{3001}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{3002}{}{That's all I need to hear right now.}
{3002}{}{我现在只想听这些。}
#{3050}{}{I can't say it's surprising at all. That's how business is done in Sedit. And in this case, we had an opportunity to see Nicol with our own eyes, that's not something that happens every day around here. I gotta say I'm disappointed, I imagined she'd look different. But that's because she's too discussed by people in Sedit who've never seen her.}
{3050}{}{我一点也不奇怪。塞迪特的生意就是这样做的。在这种情况下，我们有机会亲眼见到尼科尔，这不是每天都会发生的事情。我得说我很失望，我想象她会看起来不一样。但那是因为她在赛迪特的人讨论得太多了，从来没见过她。}
#{3051}{}{You hadn't seen her before?}
{3051}{}{你以前没见过她？}
#{3100}{}{I told you I'm not interested in running our company, so unlike Demetre, I never dealt with her. And Nicol never shows herself unless it's necessary. Sometimes you can even hear people saying she doesn't even exist. Usually from moronic drunkards.}
{3100}{}{我告诉过你我对经营我们公司不感兴趣，所以不像德米特里，我从来没有和她打过交道。尼科尔从不露面除非有必要。有时你甚至可以听到人们说她根本不存在。通常是因为酒鬼。}
#{3101}{}{I have another question.}
{3101}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{3102}{}{That's all I need to hear right now.}
{3102}{}{我现在只想听这些。}
#{3150}{}{I say let them try to attack a Crimson Caravan transport if they're crazy enough. The caravan guards will deal with them in no time.}
{3150}{}{我说如果他们够疯狂的话，就让他们去攻击一辆深红色的大篷车。商队卫兵很快就会对付他们。}
#{3151}{}{I have another question.}
{3151}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{3152}{}{That's all I need to hear right now.}
{3152}{}{我现在只想听这些。}
#{3200}{}{I know better ways to commit suicide. Like jumping down from a cliff on sharp rocks.}
{3200}{}{我知道自杀的更好方法。就像从悬崖上的尖石上跳下来。}
#{3201}{}{So you're not interested in participating?}
{3201}{}{所以你对参与不感兴趣？}
#{3202}{}{You're scared!}
{3202}{}{你害怕了！}

{3250}{}{猜得好，你很快。但如果你想让野兽把你撕碎，我不会挡你的路。}
#{3251}{}{I have another question.}
{3251}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{3252}{}{That's all I need to hear right now.}
{3252}{}{我现在只想听这些。}
#{3300}{}{No, I have a little thing called self-preservation. You know, it prevents me from willingly letting wild animals tear me to pieces. But if you're up for it yourself, I won't stand in your way.}
{3300}{}{不，我有个小东西叫自我保护。你知道，它阻止了我心甘情愿地让野生动物把我撕成碎片。但如果你自己准备的话，我不会挡你的路。}

#{3350}{}{I'm sure he's damn useful when it comes to fighting, but he can't be trusted. I know guys like him, for a few caps, he'll shoot you from behind or cut your throat when you're sleeping and he won't even blink.}
{3350}{}{我肯定他在战斗中很有用，但他不可信。我知道像他这样的人，只要几分钟，他就会从背后向你开枪，或者在你睡觉的时候割断你的喉咙，他甚至连眨眼都不眨。}
#{3351}{}{I have another question.}
{3351}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{3352}{}{That's all I need to hear right now.}
{3352}{}{我现在只想听这些。}
#{3400}{}{Doing business with Rodriguez is the stupidest thing you can do. As soon as you lose his favor on account of some petty thing, he'll have you killed, no matter what you'll have done for him till then. And in no case expect me to be there with you to put my neck out for you.}
{3400}{}{和罗德里格斯做生意是你能做的最愚蠢的事。一旦你因为一些小事失去了他的好感，他就会杀了你，不管你在那之前为他做了什么。无论如何也别指望我和你在一起为你出气。}
#{3401}{}{I have another question.}
{3401}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{3402}{}{That's all I need to hear right now.}
{3402}{}{我现在只想听这些。}
#{3450}{}{It's a good deal for both parties. I'm sure people in New Hope realize the extent of their possible profits and the Crimson Caravan will no doubt throw some extra incentives in. Of course, no one'll tell them to read the small print. More precisely, that caravans rouse attention and could theoretically even draw in raiders to that godforsaken backwoods of theirs.}
{3450}{}{这对双方都是一笔好买卖。我相信新希望的人们意识到了他们可能获得的利润，而深红色的大篷车无疑会投入一些额外的奖励。当然，没人会告诉他们读小字。更确切地说，大篷车引起了人们的注意，理论上甚至可以吸引掠夺者到他们那该死的荒郊野外。}

#{3500}{}{That Maria woman must've been a real idiot if she couldn't decide which one she wants for so long. Or, I should say she'd just been using them to get expensive presents from them.

{3500}{}{那个玛丽亚女人如果这么久都不能决定要哪一个，那她一定是个大白痴。或者，我应该说她只是用它们从它们那里得到昂贵的礼物。而那两个也没有好到哪里去。他们开始为她而战，天哪！整个城镇都毁了。对于这样一个女人来说――难以置信。}

#{3652}{}{The floater's gone. See for yourself. Happy now?}
{3652}{}{漂浮物不见了。你自己看看。现在开心吗？}
#{3653}{}{I just wanted to tell you that I care for that floater more than I do for you, so I'm keeping it.}
{3653}{}{我只是想告诉你，我对那个漂浮物比对你更关心，所以我留着它。}
#{3654}{}{I just wanted to tell you that I care for that floater more than I do for you, so I'm keeping it.}
{3654}{}{我只是想告诉你，我对那个漂浮物比对你更关心，所以我留着它。}
#{3700}{}{Serves me right for asking.}
{3700}{}{我问得对。}
#{3701}{}{Ugh.}
{3701}{}{啊。}
#{3750}{}{Yeah. Until the next time you come up with something insane again.}
{3750}{}{是 啊。直到下一次你又想出什么疯狂的事。}
#{3751}{}{Cut it and follow me.}
{3751}{}{停下来跟我来。}
#{3800}{}{Go ahead and get a deathclaw or a centaur so you can enjoy a cruel and painful death. I don't give a rat's ass.}
{3800}{}{去拿一只死亡爪或半人马，这样你就可以享受残酷而痛苦的死亡。我才不在乎呢。}
#{3801}{}{I've said what was on my mind, farewell.}
{3801}{}{我已经说出了我的想法，再见。}
#{3850}{}{Go ahead and get a deathclaw or a centaur so you can enjoy a cruel and painful death. I don't give a rat's ass.}
{3850}{}{去拿一只死亡爪或半人马，这样你就可以享受残酷而痛苦的死亡。我才不在乎呢。}
#{3851}{}{I've said what was on my mind, farewell.}
{3851}{}{我已经说出了我的想法，再见。}
#{3900}{}{Each one of them is convinced that her life's better than her sister's, but the truth is they both just spread their legs for money. The only difference is that Abby is in a higher league than Valery. If a woman can't take care of herself, she'll always be a victim.}
{3900}{}{他们每个人都相信她的生活比她姐姐的好，但事实是他们都只是为了钱而撒腿。唯一的区别是艾比的联赛比瓦莱里高。如果一个女人不能照顾好自己，她永远是受害者。}
#{3901}{}{I have another question.}
{3901}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{3902}{}{That's all I need to hear right now.}
{3902}{}{我现在只想听这些。}
#{3950}{}{Yeah, I'm following the current developments. What's on your mind?}
{3950}{}{是的，我在跟踪最新进展。你在想什么？}
#{3951}{}{Who do you think would be a better ruler of Corath?}
{3951}{}{你认为谁会是科拉斯更好的统治者？}
#{3952}{}{Which of those two will pay better if we help them destroy the other one?}
{3952}{}{如果我们帮助他们摧毁另一个，那两个谁会付出更高的代价？}
#{4000}{}{You think one of them cares about some dubious well-being of the others? Don't be ridiculous, it's all about business. They both want to profit as much as possible from mining and the only way to get that is to get rid of the competition. The person who'll manage to keep this place prospering will be the better ruler of Corath.}
{4000}{}{你认为他们中的一个关心其他人不确定的幸福吗？别傻了，都是为了生意。他们都想从采矿业中获得尽可能多的利润，唯一的办法就是摆脱竞争。使这个地方繁荣起来的人将是科拉斯更好的统治者。}
#{4001}{}{I have another question.}
{4001}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{4002}{}{That's all I need to hear right now.}
{4002}{}{我现在只想听这些。}
#{4050}{}{Hard to say. They both want to rule Corath no matter what. No wonder, really. The person to control the town in its entirety can get filthy rich from mining, if they're up to using their position properly.}
{4050}{}{很难说。不管怎样他们都想统治科拉斯。难怪，真的。一个控制整个城镇的人，如果能恰当地利用自己的位置，就可以从采矿中获得暴富。}
#{4051}{}{I have another question.}
{4051}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{4052}{}{That's all I need to hear right now.}
{4052}{}{我现在只想听这些。}
#{4100}{}{If you must provoke conflicts in this fucked up place, you could at least have the balls to deal with it yourself right till the end!}
{4100}{}{如果你一定要在这个乱七八糟的地方挑起冲突，你至少有胆量自己来处理，直到最后！}
#{4101}{}{Why so angry? You did well, didn't you?}
{4101}{}{为什么这么生气？你做得很好，不是吗？}
#{4102}{}{Sorry, I won't send you to the ring anymore.}
{4102}{}{对不起，我不再送你去拳击场了。}
#{4150}{}{Hey, flattery won't make me enjoy taking the blows for you.}
{4150}{}{嘿，奉承不会让我喜欢为你承受打击。}
#{4151}{}{[Say nothing.]}
{4151}{}{[什么也不说。]}
#{4200}{}{You don't have to tell me that. Just make sure you act by it.}
{4200}{}{你不用告诉我。一定要按计划行事。}
#{4201}{}{[Say nothing.]}
{4201}{}{[什么也不说。]}
#{4250}{}{If you must provoke conflicts in this fucked up place, you could at least have the balls to deal with it yourself right till the end!}

#{4251}{}{Why so angry? You did well, didn't you?}
{4251}{}{为什么这么生气？你做得很好，不是吗？}
#{4252}{}{Sorry, I won't send you to the ring anymore.}
{4252}{}{对不起，我不再送你去拳击场了。}
#{4300}{}{That idiot probably hasn't even noticed it or refused to register it. Just like the fact that I no longer work for the Crimson Caravan. Damn it, that dickhead's probably doing it to spite me.}
{4300}{}{那个白痴可能根本没注意到或者拒绝注册。就像我不再为深红色大篷车工作一样。妈的，那个白痴这么做可能是为了激怒我。}
#{4301}{}{I have another question.}
{4301}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{4302}{}{That's all I need to hear right now.}
{4302}{}{我现在只想听这些。}
#{4350}{}{It wasn't my first time. It's good with a woman. Better, in many ways, but it just doesn't feel like the right thing because that one main element is missing. A man's hard dick.}
{4350}{}{这不是我第一次。和女人在一起很好。在很多方面都更好，但感觉不太对劲，因为缺少了一个主要元素。男人的硬阴茎。}
#{4351}{}{I can be of help with that.}
{4351}{}{我能帮上忙。}
#{4352}{}{I have another question.}
{4352}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{4353}{}{That's all I need to hear right now.}
{4353}{}{我现在只想听这些。}
#{4400}{}{Hold your horses, that's not why I'm traveling with you. And even if I felt a sudden irresistible urge to have sex, I'm capable of finding a man who'll quench it real and proper. And it wouldn't be you, darling.}
{4400}{}{别急，这不是我和你一起旅行的原因。即使我突然有一种不可抗拒的性欲，我也能找到一个真正合适的男人。不是你，亲爱的。}
#{4401}{}{Forget I said anything.}
{4401}{}{忘了我说过什么。}
#{4450}{}{William is a trader and apparently a good one, given he's been making a profit in the Suburbs of Albuquerque, where he's under the pressure of Mutant Hunters as well as Vex's gang. And on top of that, he's forced to trade with those thick savages.}
{4450}{}{威廉是一个商人，显然是一个很好的商人，因为他一直在阿尔伯克基郊区盈利，在那里他面临着变种猎人以及维克斯团伙的压力。除此之外，他还被迫和那些粗壮的野蛮人交易。}
#{4451}{}{I have another question.}
{4451}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{4452}{}{That's all I need to hear right now.}
{4452}{}{我现在只想听这些。}
#{4500}{}{She seems OK, but she's one of the vault dwellers and their offspring. People like them always consider themselves superior to others. The worst of them even suffer from the delusion that the world needs to be more civilized, whatever they think it means. She grew up in that environment, some of it must've stuck to her. I'll watch her.}
{4500}{}{她看起来很好，但她是金库居民和他们的后代之一。像他们这样的人总是认为自己比别人优越。他们中最坏的人甚至产生错觉，认为世界需要更文明，不管他们认为这意味着什么。她是在那种环境中长大的，一定有一部分是她自己的。我会看着她的。}
#{4501}{}{I have another question.}
{4501}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{4502}{}{That's all I need to hear right now.}
{4502}{}{我现在只想听这些。}
#{4550}{}{I've seen him around. From what I've heard, he's one hell of a motherfucker, but he does his job. There isn't a caravan safer than the one he's with. As long as cargo's concerned. I don't know if it's true or not, but he's been known to use another guard as a bait to deal with the attackers.}
{4550}{}{我在附近见过他。据我所知，他是个混蛋，但他做他的工作。再没有比和他在一起的大篷车更安全的了。就货物而言。我不知道这是不是真的，但他用另一个警卫作为诱饵对付袭击者。}
#{4551}{}{I have another question.}
{4551}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{4552}{}{That's all I need to hear right now.}
{4552}{}{我现在只想听这些。}
#{4600}{}{Not at all. At least until such time when you start to believe I've developed a mutation.}
{4600}{}{一点也不。至少在你开始相信我有变异之前。}
#{4601}{}{I don't agree with the Hunters. Joining them simply served our purpose.}
{4601}{}{我不同意猎人的说法。加入他们只是为了达到我们的目的。}
#{4602}{}{In that case, I'd have to kill you.}
{4602}{}{那样的话，我就得杀了你。}
#{4603}{}{In that case, I'd have to kill you.}
{4603}{}{那样的话，我就得杀了你。}
#{4650}{}{See, this is exactly the kind of think I would fucking mind! Damn, don't tell me you actually believe those fairy-tales the Hunters feed you. It's good to know.}
{4650}{}{看，这正是我他妈的介意的那种！妈的，别告诉我你真的相信猎人给你的那些童话。很高兴知道。}
#{4651}{}{I'll be watching you.}
{4651}{}{我会看着你的。}
#{4700}{}{Damn, I hope you're not messing with me. The idea of traveling with a fanatic doesn't really tickle my fancy.}
{4700}{}{妈的，我希望你没耍我。和一个狂热的人一起旅行的想法并没有真正引起我的兴趣。}
#{4701}{}{Damn, I hope you're not messing with me. The idea of traveling with a fanatic doesn't really tickle my fancy.}
{4701}{}{妈的，我希望你没耍我。和一个狂热的人一起旅行的想法并没有真正引起我的兴趣。}
#{4702}{}{Don't worry.}
{4702}{}{别担心。}
#{4750}{}{We need to find a way to sneak inside, if it's possible. If we're really lucky, they might not even notice and eliminate us in some particularly painful way. Fuck, I'm not sure if I want to do this with you. It could be cooler than I'm able to manage.}
{4750}{}{如果可能的话，我们得想办法偷偷溜进去。如果我们真的幸运的话，他们甚至可能不会注意到并以某种特别痛苦的方式消灭我们。妈的，我不知道我是否想和你一起做。可能会比我想象的更酷。}
#{4751}{}{I have another question.}
{4751}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{4752}{}{That's all I need to hear right now.}
{4752}{}{我现在只想听这些。}
#{4800}{}{So now you want to hear my opinion?! Good! I say it's madness! Look, I'm not particularly fond of the Hunters, but they got one thing right. Supermutants are a threat and they can't be trusted.}
{4800}{}{所以现在你想听我的意见？！很好！我说这太疯狂了！听着，我不是特别喜欢猎人，但他们有一点是对的。超级变种人是一种威胁，他们不能被信任。}
#{4801}{}{I think we can trust Dernus. But I understand why you'd have problem with that.}
{4801}{}{我想我们可以相信德努斯。但我明白你为什么会有这样的问题。}
#{4802}{}{I don't trust Dernus either, but I believe it's worth a try. We can always resort to fighting if it doesn't work.}
{4802}{}{我也不相信德努斯，但我相信值得一试。如果不起作用，我们总是可以诉诸战斗。}
#{4803}{}{Just trust my judgment and shut up.}
{4803}{}{相信我的判断闭嘴。}
#{4850}{}{Damn, you say it as if it was some sort of my own personal fucking problem! But the problem is that nobody's ever seen a supermutant who didn't want to kill all humans! Well, except the times of the Master, when they wanted to turn people into demented hordes of flesh like they themselves are.}
{4850}{}{妈的，你说的好像是我自己的问题！但问题是，从来没有人见过不想杀死所有人类的超级变种人！好吧，除了主人的时代，他们想把人变成像他们自己一样疯狂的人肉大军。}
#{4851}{}{I think this arguing's gone on for long enough.}
{4851}{}{我想这场争论已经持续很久了。}
#{4900}{}{OK, as you think. But I'm warning you, you better watch out, he's able to kill you before you can say "bad idea" just on account of you being human.}
{4900}{}{好吧，如你所想。但我警告你，你最好小心，他能在你说“坏主意”之前杀了你，就因为你是人类。}
#{4901}{}{I'll be careful.}
{4901}{}{我会小心的。}
#{4950}{}{Go eat irradiated brahmin shit! If you're not interested in my opinion, then don't fucking ask!}
{4950}{}{去吃辐照双头牛屎！如果你对我的意见不感兴趣，那就别问了！}
#{4951}{}{Finally a useful idea.}
{4951}{}{最后是一个有用的主意。}
#{5000}{}{From what he said, it seems there are many more like him who'll go after you, willing to get you no matter what. We definitely won't be bored. Yeah, I got what I asked for, to see some action. I hope I won't regret it.}
{5000}{}{从他说的话来看，似乎还有更多像他这样的人会去追你，不管怎样都愿意得到你。我们绝对不会感到无聊。是的，我得到了我想要的，去看一些行动。我希望我不会后悔。}
#{5001}{}{I have another question.}
{5001}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{5002}{}{That's all I need to hear right now.}
{5002}{}{我现在只想听这些。}
#{5050}{}{Look, it looks like we really found something with those base coordinates. But do you really think you used to be a ghoul? Damn, if I was in the condition that ghoul from the Hunters was in, I'd be speaking all kinds of shit too. Matter of fact, if I was in his condition, I'd have already kicked the bucket.}
{5050}{}{听着，看起来我们真的找到了一些与这些基本坐标有关的东西。但你真的认为你以前是僵尸吗？该死的，如果我是猎人的僵尸，我也会说各种各样的废话。事实上，如果我处于他的状况，我早就被解雇了。}

{5053}{}{我不知道。我不知道该怎么想。}
#{5100}{}{Wow, that's something. And here I was, thinking I must've heard it all. That means there're things here someone's gotta do and it seems we're that someone.}
{5100}{}{哇，真了不起。我就在这里，想我一定都听说过了。这意味着这里有人要做的事情，而我们似乎就是那个人。}
#{5101}{}{Are you sure you want to stay with me? It's going to be dangerous.}
{5101}{}{你确定要和我在一起吗？会很危险的。}
#{5102}{}{If you want to step back now, because it's going to be dangerous, then you better forget the idea.}
{5102}{}{如果你现在想退后一步，因为那会很危险，那你最好忘掉这个想法。}
#{5150}{}{I guess this is the only place where we can find the truth, so we don't really have a choice. But that's life for you.}
{5150}{}{我想这是我们唯一能找到真相的地方，所以我们别无选择。但这就是你的生活。}
#{5151}{}{Are you sure you want to stay with me? It's going to be dangerous.}
{5151}{}{你确定要和我在一起吗？会很危险的。}
#{5152}{}{If you want to step back now, because it's going to be dangerous, then you better forget the idea.}
{5152}{}{如果你现在想退后一步，因为那会很危险，那你最好忘掉这个想法。}
#{5200}{}{Wherever you go, danger's always right there behind you. But damn it, I wouldn't want it any other way. This is the place where we find the right asses that need kicking. I'm not letting these fanatics destroy more towns and get to Sedit, eventually. And the longer I've been away, the more I realize how much I care for that rotten place.}
{5200}{}{无论你走到哪里，危险总是在你身后。但该死的，我不想用别的方法。这是我们找到需要踢的屁股的地方。我不会让这些狂热分子摧毁更多的城镇，最终到达塞迪特。我离开的时间越长，我就越意识到我多么在乎那个烂地方。}
#{5201}{}{OK.}
{5201}{}{好 啊。}
#{5250}{}{Look, it looks like we really found something with those base coordinates. But do you really think you used to be a ghoul? Damn, if I'd been tortured by the Hunters like that ghoul, I'd scream any kind of madness on top of my voice just to please them.}
{5250}{}{听着，看起来我们真的找到了一些与这些基本坐标有关的东西。但你真的认为你以前是僵尸吗？该死的，如果我被猎人折磨得像那个僵尸，我会用任何疯狂的声音尖叫来取悦他们。}

{5253}{}{我不知道。我不知道该怎么想。}
#{5300}{}{Of course I recognized them, I'm not blind. They seem very comfortable because of your help. As a bonus, they really seem to hate you on account of you being the Thirteenth. You should be more careful next time about who you're helping and what with.}

#{5352}{}{That's all I need to hear right now.}
{5352}{}{我现在只想听这些。}
#{5400}{}{It's difficult to remember someone specific who used to work as a caravan guard. There's a lot of those and new ones are always welcome, because many of them die in that profession or they soon give up. Damn, even if I used to know Kath back then, I wouldn't recognize her now.}
{5400}{}{很难记起一个曾经是商队警卫的人。有很多这样的人，新的人总是受欢迎的，因为他们中的许多人死在那个行业或者很快就放弃了。该死，即使我以前认识凯丝，现在也认不出她了。}

{5452}{}{你说得对。我现在只想听这些。}
#{5500}{}{Both are desperate enough, but I guess they don't have anything better in their hands. Just don't forget we gotta get out of here somehow, too. I don't like the idea of sacrificing our own lives to save others.}
{5500}{}{两人都很绝望，但我猜他们手里没有更好的了。别忘了我们也得离开这里。我不喜欢牺牲自己的生命去拯救别人。}

{5550}{}{你想象不到我多么想把这个告诉所有的猎人。我会告诉他们，看他们的表情，如果不是自杀的话。该死，不管怎样，这种不可磨灭的盲目热情总有一天会毁灭我们的。不过，现在我只希望在救世主死后，僵尸不会像主人死后的超级变种人那样狂暴并开始杀人。}

#{5600}{}{Well, that's something. If old Harold could hear this, his eyes would pop out of their sockets. And here I was, thinking I must've heard it all. That means there're things here someone's gotta do and it seems we're that someone.}

#{5650}{}{I'm not jumping through the roof, but you're lucky it wasn't one of the Crimson Caravan's, and you're going to keep your mouth shut about it. The encounter with ghouls itself was very interesting. It looked like they were more interested in you than in the rest of the caravan.}
{5650}{}{我不想从屋顶跳下去，但你很幸运那不是一辆深红色的大篷车，你得闭嘴。与僵尸的接触本身就非常有趣。看起来他们对你比对车队其他人更感兴趣。}

#{5652}{}{That's all I need to hear right now.}
{5652}{}{我现在只想听这些。}
#{5700}{}{Brahmins are the most valuable asset to any caravan company. Without them, you might as well carry the goods on your back. Carts can be repaired easily, people can be hired, but an adult draft brahmin is a valuable property which is very hard to replace. The only things that really matter in a caravan are the goods and brahmins.}
{5700}{}{双头牛是任何商队公司最宝贵的资产。没有它们，你还不如把货物背在背上。手推车可以很容易地修理，人们可以被雇用，但一个成人草案双头牛是一个宝贵的财产，这是很难取代。商队里真正重要的东西只有货物和双头牛。}

{5752}{}{你来了。当那东西倒在你下面时，我们四处看看是否能找到另一个入口。给你。加布里埃尔已经准备好离开你了。我自己也怀疑你还活着。你能不能别胡说八道了，这样我们就可以继续了？}
#{5753}{}{I almost got crushed under the falling ceiling and after that I met a deathclaw on my way here. You think I'm doing this just for the fun of it?}
{5753}{}{我差点被坠落的天花板压碎，然后在来这里的路上遇到了一只死爪。你以为我这么做只是为了好玩？}
#{5754}{}{I almost got crushed under the falling ceiling and after that I met a deathclaw on my way here. You think I'm doing this just for the fun of it?}
{5754}{}{我差点被坠落的天花板压碎，然后在来这里的路上遇到了一只死爪。你以为我这么做只是为了好玩？}
#{5755}{}{Deathclaw there! Keri gone!}
{5755}{}{死爪在那里！克里走了！}
#{5800}{}{Say whatever you want, but we're not going to waste time on one spot, are we? Let's go, please?}
{5800}{}{你想说什么就说什么，但我们不会在一个地方浪费时间，是吗？我们走吧，好吗？}
#{5801}{}{Sure.}
{5801}{}{当然。}
#{5850}{}{There you are. I tried to look for a way in after the whole place collapsed, but to no avail. I was starting to doubt you'd survived. You OK? Can we move on?}
{5850}{}{你来了。整个房子倒塌后，我想找条路进去，但没用。我开始怀疑你能活下来。你没事吧？我们能继续吗？}
#{5851}{}{There you are. We tried to look for a way in after the whole place collapsed, but to no avail. I was starting to doubt you'd survived. Of course, Lystra was scared to death about you. You OK? Can we move on?}
{5851}{}{你来了。整个地方倒塌后，我们试图找一条路进去，但没有成功。我开始怀疑你能活下来。当然，莱斯特拉为你吓得要死。你没事吧？我们能继续吗？}

#{5853}{}{Yeah, I'm OK. Let's go.}
{5853}{}{是的，我没事。走吧。}
#{5854}{}{Keri live!}
{5854}{}{克里活着！}
#{6000}{}{Surprised to see me? You thought I'd wait for you until the end of time? I thought you were dead. That would be a solid excuse to use as an explanation why you didn't show up for so long. For your own good, I'll assume you'd had a damn good reason to leave like that. Can we cut the crap and set out again or are you no longer interested in my company?}
{6000}{}{见到我很惊讶？你以为我会等你到最后？我以为你死了。那将是一个很好的借口来解释你为什么这么长时间没有出现。为了你自己，我想你有很好的理由这样离开。我们能不能少说废话，重新出发？还是你对我的公司不再感兴趣了？}

#{6002}{}{OK, you don't want to hear anything, I won't bother you, then. I just want to say I'm sorry.}
{6002}{}{好吧，你什么都不想听，那我就不打扰你了。我只想说声对不起。}
#{6003}{}{Burpwah.}
{6003}{}{伯普瓦。}
#{6050}{}{As I said, let's leave it. So, what now?}
{6050}{}{就像我说的，让我们离开吧。那么，现在怎么办？}
#{6051}{}{I want you to join me again.}
{6051}{}{我要你再加入我。}
#{6052}{}{Wait here a little longer.}
{6052}{}{在这儿再等一会儿。}
#{6100}{}{I waited for you, but I'm sure you realized I wouldn't stay glued to one spot forever. I'm better off at home. So, what now?}
{6100}{}{我等着你，但我肯定你意识到我不会永远呆在一个地方。我在家过得更好。那么，现在怎么办？}
#{6101}{}{I want you to join me again.}
{6101}{}{我要你再加入我。}
#{6102}{}{Wait here a little longer.}
{6102}{}{在这儿再等一会儿。}
#{6103}{}{Burpwah.}
{6103}{}{伯普瓦。}
#{10000}{}{Damn it, what's going on, Gabriel? Why are you staring at me like that?!}
{10000}{}{该死，怎么了，加布里埃尔？你为什么那样盯着我？！}
#{10001}{}{I've just been thinking you really need a fucking good time with a fucking real man.}
{10001}{}{我一直在想你真的需要和一个真正的男人好好相处。}
#{10002}{}{And that would be you?}
{10002}{}{那就是你？}
#{10003}{}{All I'm gonna say is you'd never forget it for the rest of your life.}
{10003}{}{我要说的是你下半辈子都不会忘记。}
#{10004}{}{You'd have to use a knife to leave an impression.}
{10004}{}{你得用刀才能留下印象。}
#{10005}{}{If that's how you prefer it...}
{10005}{}{如果你喜欢这样。。。}
#{10006}{}{Go fuck yourself, wacko.}
{10006}{}{去你妈的，疯子。}
#{10016}{}{Gabriel, isn't there a reward put out for your head somewhere?}
{10016}{}{加布里埃尔，你的头不是有奖励吗？}
#{10017}{}{I take care of all traces and witnesses very thoroughly. The only people who know about me are the bastards who can afford me.}
{10017}{}{我对所有的痕迹和证人都非常仔细。唯一了解我的人就是那些能负担得起我的混蛋。}
#{10018}{}{I was just curious.}
{10018}{}{我只是好奇。}
#{10019}{}{And isn't there some bonehead willing to pay for YOUR death?}
{10019}{}{难道没有哪个笨蛋愿意为你的死付出代价吗？}
#{10020}{}{I'm sure you'd be willing to take up on the offer for a few caps, huh?}
{10020}{}{我相信你愿意接受几杯的报价，对吧？}
#{10021}{}{You're worth more than a few lousy caps, sweetpants.}
{10021}{}{你比几顶烂瓶盖还值钱，甜心。}
#{10022}{}{Damn, sounds almost like words of praise. It'll be better if you stop talking.}
{10022}{}{该死，听起来像是赞美的话。你最好别说话了。}
#{10030}{}{What's your problem with the hospital, Lystra? Is it the fact they've helped more people than all the imperial doctors combined?}
{10030}{}{你对医院有什么意见，莱斯特拉？是不是他们帮助的人比所有御医加起来还多？}
#{10031}{}{What are you talking about? We treat people...}
{10031}{}{你在说什么？我们对待别人。。。}
#{10032}{}{Only your own people. When it comes to the number of treated strangers, the hospital in Dead Quarter is ahead of you.}
{10032}{}{只有你自己的人。说到接受治疗的陌生人的数量，死区的医院在你前面。}
#{10033}{}{Yeah, also when it comes to the number of the people who died. You can't compare them like that.}
{10033}{}{是的，还有死亡人数。你不能那样比较他们。}
#{10034}{}{They didn't have money. So they'd have probably died anyway. That's life.}
{10034}{}{他们没有钱。所以他们可能已经死了。这就是生活。}
#{10035}{}{You're telling me you agree with what they're doing? It's disgusting!}
{10035}{}{你是说你同意他们的做法？真恶心！}
#{10036}{}{Damn it, I'm not saying I like it. I'm just saying the doctors gotta make a living, too.}
{10036}{}{该死，我不是说我喜欢。我只是说医生也要谋生。}
#{10037}{}{I don't want to talk about this anymore.}
{10037}{}{我不想再谈这个了。}
