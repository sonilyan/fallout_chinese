### {100}{}{Yes, can I help you.}
{100}{}{是的，我能帮你吗。}
### {101}{}{What is this place?}
{101}{}{这是什么地方？}
### {102}{}{Nothing.}
{102}{}{没有什么}
### {103}{}{This is Stockman's Association. We're something like the banks of the 20th century. People pay us and we keep their things safe and sound. We also had a market for coal, but it's been twenty years since that stopped. When Miners Town closed its mine, we stopped selling any because our reserves were about zero. [Smiles.] Our town is really interested in rebuilding our cooperation with the authorities of Miners Town. If only someone were to tell them about our plans.}
{103}{}{这是斯托克曼协会。我们有点像20世纪的银行。人们付钱给我们，我们保证他们的东西安然无恙。我们也有煤炭市场，但已经20年没有了。当Miners Town关闭矿山时，我们停止了任何销售，因为我们的储量大约为零。[微笑]我们镇真的很有兴趣重建我们与矿工镇当局的合作。要是有人告诉他们我们的计划就好了。}
### {104}{}{Why don't you just send a delegate?}
{104}{}{你为什么不派一个代表来？}
### {105}{}{So you think that the deal can be made?}
{105}{}{所以你认为这笔交易可以达成吗？}
### {106}{}{What's stopping that cooperation?}
{106}{}{是什么阻止了这种合作？}
### {107}{}{I wish it would be that easy! But they don't want to discuss the matter. There was some earlier incident that lead us to where we are now. People refuse even to think about going there... I really don't know how to start negotiations.}
{107}{}{我希望它能那么容易！但他们不想讨论这个问题。早些时候发生的一些事件使我们走到了现在的地步。人们甚至拒绝考虑去那里。。。我真的不知道如何开始谈判。}
### {108}{}{Maybe I can help.}
{108}{}{也许我能帮上忙。}
### {109}{}{I have no idea either. I'll come back later.}
{109}{}{我也不知道。我稍后再回来。}
### {110}{}{I'm not so sure about that. Last time we went there on peaceful negotiations, we were treated like we were some tribals. So the best thing is that we send someone trustworthy who also has connections in Miners Town. We haven't come across someone like that so far though. People from this town have a very bad opinion about Miners. There is too much bad blood.}
{110}{}{我对此不太确定。上次我们去那里进行和平谈判时，我们被当作部落成员对待。所以最好的办法是我们派一个值得信赖的人，他在矿工镇也有关系。到目前为止，我们还没有遇到这样的人。这个镇上的人对矿工队的评价很差。坏血太多了。}
### {111}{}{You know... You mentioned that you need someone who has connections in Miners Town, I think you just found your best candidate.}
{111}{}{你知道。。。你提到你需要一个在矿工镇有关系的人，我想你刚刚找到了最好的候选人。}
### {112}{}{People should think about something else than hate. I'm leaving.}
{112}{}{人们应该考虑的不是仇恨。我要走了。}
### {113}{}{You? What makes you think you're qualified?}
{113}{}{你你凭什么认为自己合格？}
### {114}{}{I happen to know some of the influential people in Miners. And I'm willing to talk with their authorities on your behalf.}
{114}{}{我碰巧认识Miners的一些有影响力的人。我愿意代表你与他们的主管部门谈谈。}
### {115}{}{Just a thought. You need someone to try and get negotiations started.}
{115}{}{只是一个想法。你需要有人试着开始谈判。}
### {116}{}{Nope, I changed my mind. It's an issue I don't want to be involved in after all.}
{116}{}{没有，我改变了主意。这是一个我不想卷入的问题。}
### {117}{}{If you say you can convince them to start negotiations, I'll let you do it. Keep me informed about your progress and good luck.}
{117}{}{如果你说你能说服他们开始谈判，我就让你去做。随时告诉我你的进展和好运。}
### {118}{}{Thanks, I'm on it.}
{118}{}{谢谢，我在上面。}
### {119}{}{I'm glad someone has thoughts about this issue, but that's not enough, we need someone with a real chance of success. Don't bother me with your thoughts anymore. My guards will escort you to the front door, and please don't try coming back or else you'll be wasted like my time!}
{119}{}{我很高兴有人对这个问题有想法，但这还不够，我们需要一个真正有成功机会的人。别再为你的想法打扰我了。我的警卫会护送你到前门，请不要试图回来，否则你会像我一样浪费时间！}
### {120}{}{That a joke? What about the punch line, bitch!?}
{120}{}{这是个笑话吗？那句妙语呢，婊子！？}
### {121}{}{I'll go peacefully.}
{121}{}{我会平静地去。}
### {122}{}{When we went there with a peace offering, we were attacked. After that experience, I don't even entertain thoughts of going back there. Somebody else needs to lead these peace negotiations.}
{122}{}{当我们带着和平礼物去那里时，我们遭到了袭击。在那次经历之后，我甚至不想再去那里了。需要其他人来领导这些和平谈判。}
### {123}{}{I could be your delegate. I think I can wheel that deal for you.}
{123}{}{我可以做你的代表。我想我可以帮你完成这笔交易。}
### {124}{}{Yep. I wonder who would be crazy enough to go back there. Good luck.}
{124}{}{是的。我想知道谁会疯到回到那里。祝你好运}
### {125}{}{Hello again. Can I help you with something?}
{125}{}{你好。我能帮你做点什么吗？}
### {126}{}{What news do you bring me? Have you talked with the Miners Town authorities?}
{126}{}{你给我带来什么消息？你和矿工镇当局谈过了吗？}
### {127}{}{I've talked to the owner of the mine.}
{127}{}{我已经和矿主谈过了。}
### {128}{}{Still working on it.}
{128}{}{还在努力。}
### {129}{}{And? What did he say?}
{129}{}{和他说了什么？}
### {130}{}{He is willing to renegotiate your contract and offers his full cooperation if you pay him $3000 every month, in advance.}
{130}{}{他愿意重新谈判你的合同，如果你每月提前付给他3000美元，他会全力配合。}
### {131}{}{He doesn't trust you because you didn't pay him last time. Therefore he has a message for you: Farmers' citizens are forbidden to come near their town, or they will be shot.}
{131}{}{他不信任你，因为你上次没有付钱给他。因此，他有一个信息要告诉你：农民的公民被禁止靠近他们的城镇，否则他们将被枪杀。}
### {132}{}{Our main problem is that we don't have any cash flow, that's why the cooperation ended in the first place. We could pull some strings and have the money eventually, but it takes time.}
{132}{}{我们的主要问题是我们没有任何现金流，这就是合作最初结束的原因。我们可以牵线搭桥，最终拿到钱，但这需要时间。}
### {133}{}{Is there any way I can help? Maybe I can finance you?}
{133}{}{有什么我能帮忙的吗？也许我可以资助你？}
### {134}{}{Well, no money... no deal. I'll go tell him you haven't accepted his terms.}
{134}{}{没有钱。。。没有交易。我去告诉他你还没有接受他的条件。}
### {135}{}{You really are willing to do that?}
{135}{}{你真的愿意这么做吗？}
### {136}{}{Of course, I have the assets and I'd be glad to help.}
{136}{}{当然，我有资产，我很乐意提供帮助。}
### {137}{}{On second thought, I don't have that kind of money right now. I'll be back when I have it.}
{137}{}{转念一想，我现在没有那么多钱。我有了它就会回来。}
### {138}{}{Thank you very much. You just send him the money and we will try to make things right this time.}
{138}{}{非常感谢。你只要把钱寄给他，我们这次就会尽力把事情做好。}
