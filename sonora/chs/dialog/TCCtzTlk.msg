#Questions
### {220}{}{Can you tell me why tinsmiths buy slaves?}
{220}{}{你能告诉我为什么锡匠会买奴隶吗？}
### {221}{}{We need a workforce to make progress. Without slaves, the process would be much slower and less efficient. Someday we will replace slaves with robots, but it will take a lot of time and energy, which is so lacking now.}
{221}{}{我们需要一支队伍来取得进步。如果没有奴隶，这个过程会慢得多，效率也会降低。总有一天，我们会用机器人取代奴隶，但这需要大量的时间和精力，而这正是现在所缺乏的。}
### {222}{}{Tell us about the Progress.}
{222}{}{告诉我们进度。}
### {223}{}{The achievement of technological and civilized perfection, as it was before the Great War. In our time, Progress is necessary for the survival of humanity as a species.}
{223}{}{技术和文明的完美成就，就像大战前一样。在我们这个时代，进步是人类作为一个物种生存所必需的。}
### {224}{}{}
{224}{}{error : string is empty}
### {225}{}{}
{225}{}{error : string is empty}
### {226}{}{Do you know anything about Villa slaves?}

### {227}{}{No. This should be discussed with Master Hard, our leader.}
{227}{}{不，这应该和我们的领导人哈德大师讨论。}
### {228}{}{And do you agree with such an inhumane practice?}
{228}{}{你同意这种不人道的做法吗？}
### {229}{}{The ethical aspect of the issue is not essential. Progress is worth the sacrifice, it will give people more than a handful of primitive people from the wasteland.}
{229}{}{这个问题的伦理方面并不重要。进步是值得牺牲的，它会给人们带来比一小撮来自荒原的原始人更多的东西。}

### {230}{}{What do you do?}
{230}{}{你是做什么的？}
### {231}{}{I serve the workers in the hangar. I prepare nutrients and keep order in the residential complex.}
{231}{}{我为机库里的工人服务。我在住宅区准备营养物质并维持秩序。}
### {232}{}{So do tinsmiths have families?}
{232}{}{那么，锡匠有家庭吗？}

### {240}{}{Why are you so distrustful of outsiders?}
{240}{}{你为什么这么不信任外人？}
### {241}{}{Trust is immaterial. We outperform almost all the inhabitants of the Wasteland in terms of development coefficient. In such a situation, outsiders can be useful mainly as slaves, in some cases as trading partners.}
{241}{}{信任是无关紧要的。就发展系数而言，我们几乎胜过荒原上的所有居民。在这种情况下，局外人可以主要作为奴隶，在某些情况下作为贸易伙伴发挥作用。}
