### {246}{}{The fight against the troops from Phoenix forced the whole tribe to gather in San Brahmin to defend our freedom and our values. Besides, this pueblo has always been our seasonal haven during dust storms and droughts.}

### {253}{}{But what's wrong with these old things?}
{253}{}{但是这些旧东西怎么了？}
### {254}{}{We wander through the desert and live by what the desert gives us. Our people and our herds are the only thing that is valuable. There is no need for young people to join the things of the Ancient World. It's useless and unsafe.}
{254}{}{我们漫步在沙漠中，依靠沙漠给我们的生活。我们的人民和我们的牛群是唯一有价值的东西。年轻人没有必要加入古代世界。它既无用又不安全。}
### {255}{}{Whatever you say. Can I take these things?}
{255}{}{不管你说什么。我可以拿这些东西吗？}
### {256}{}{You're doing some nonsense. These are just old things, there are a lot of them on the ruins.}
{256}{}{你在胡说八道。这些都是旧东西，废墟上有很多。}
### {257}{}{But we don't live on those ruins! We are wandering through the Sonoran desert. Our people and our herds are the only thing that is valuable to us. There is no need for young people to join the things of the Ancient World. It's not safe.}

{258}{}{不管你说什么。交换一下怎么样？我可以把他们从这里带回废墟。}

{260}{}{嗯。如果你真的是我听说的别墅的人，那么我应该对你更有利。也许我们的部落有些相似。}
### {261}{}{It's not worth burning these things. Let me exchange them and take them away from here?}
{261}{}{这些东西不值得烧掉。让我交换一下，然后从这里拿走？}
### {262}{}{I don't care what happens to pagan talismans. It is much more important to teach the apostates a lesson and show the rest the truth. But I don't mind getting a benefit from the exchange, if you really have something to offer.}
{262}{}{我不在乎异教徒的护身符会发生什么。更重要的是给叛教者一个教训，并向其他人展示真相。但如果你真的有什么可以提供的，我不介意从交换中获得好处。}
### {263}{}{I think we can negotiate.}

### {275}{}{What kind of weapons do strangers have?}
{275}{}{陌生人有什么武器？}
### {276}{}{The aliens have fire sticks and durable metal armor. We cannot resist with our spears against such an army. Only cunning and knowledge of the wasteland help us fight against such a strong enemy.}
{276}{}{外星人有火棍和耐用的金属盔甲。我们不能用长矛抵抗这样的军队。只有狡猾和对荒原的了解才能帮助我们对抗如此强大的敌人。}
### {277}{}{What soulless technologies are you talking about?}
{277}{}{你在说什么没有灵魂的技术？}
### {278}{}{Old things whose power comes from other old things. You call it "bat-tare" and "radiation". For a long time, no one from the tribe dared to even touch these things. And now in Phoenix and Two-Sun they make them as easily and deftly as we make bags made of brahmin leather.}
{278}{}{力量来自其他古老事物的古老事物。你称之为“蝙蝠皮重”和“辐射”。很长一段时间以来，部落里没有人敢碰这些东西。现在，在凤凰城和两个太阳城，他们制作它们就像我们制作婆罗门皮革袋一样简单灵巧。}
### {279}{}{What kind of firewater is this?}
{279}{}{这是什么样的消防水？}
### {280}{}{This bitter smelly liquid came to us from Phoenix. She stupefies the head, like a Dark Brahmin. Those who drink this water do strange things. I try to burn all the supplies I find, but it's in vain. Until Phoenix stops producing and selling the tribe's drink, the general hangover will not stop.}
{280}{}{这种气味苦涩的液体是从凤凰城来的。她像一个黑暗的婆罗门一样把脑袋打晕。那些喝这种水的人会做一些奇怪的事情。我试图烧掉我找到的所有补给品，但都是徒劳的。直到凤凰停止生产和销售部落的饮料，一般的宿醉不会停止。}
### {281}{}{There's probably a whole moonshine distillery doing it in Phoenix.}
{281}{}{凤凰城可能有一整家私酒酒厂在做这件事。}
### {282}{}{I have been looking for a long time for a person who will find and destroy this plant. Without tequila, it will be easier for our tribe to resist outsiders. Do this and I will reward you handsomely.}
{282}{}{我一直在寻找一个能找到并摧毁这种植物的人。如果没有龙舌兰酒，我们部落将更容易抵抗外来者。这样做，我会给你丰厚的报酬。}

### {284}{}{I will bring offerings to the Divine Brahmin to guide and protect you on the road. Good luck, my friend.}
{284}{}{我将为神圣的婆罗门带来祭品，在路上引导和保护你。祝你好运，我的朋友。}
### {285}{}{See you, Mangas.}
{285}{}{再见，曼加斯。}
### {286}{}{Wait, I want to know something else.}
{286}{}{等等，我想知道其他事情。}
### {287}{}{There must be a lot of security there. And I don't even know where this factory is. No, I will not interfere with the alcohol business.}
{287}{}{那里一定很安全。我甚至不知道这家工厂在哪里。不，我不会干涉酒类生意。}
### {288}{}{Then go. You're wasting our time.}
{288}{}{那就去吧。你在浪费我们的时间。}

### {290}{}{Rejoice, Mangas! The moonshine distillery in Phoenix has been completely destroyed.}
{290}{}{高兴吧，曼加斯！凤凰城的私酒酒厂已经完全被毁。}
### {291}{}{The Divine Brahmin himself must have helped you in this difficult task. Now I see that I was wrong in my attitude towards you. Not all outsiders are trying to subdue us or steal from us. Thank you, my friend from the Villa.}
{291}{}{神圣的婆罗门一定在这项艰巨的任务中帮助了你。现在我发现我对你的态度是错误的。并不是所有的外人都想制服我们或从我们这里偷东西。谢谢你，我的别墅朋友。}
### {292}{}{You're welcome.}
{292}{}{不客气。}
### {293}{}{Did you say something about a reward?}
{293}{}{你说了关于奖励的事吗？}
### {294}{}{You deserve respect and reward. Take these old things that I recently took away from the tribesmen. Surely you will find a use for all this.}
{294}{}{你应该得到尊重和奖励。拿我最近从部落里拿走的这些旧东西来说。你肯定会找到这一切的用处。}
### {295}{}{So, so, nuclear batteries, stimpacks, Radawaye and a bunch of caps... Pretty good.}
{295}{}{核电池，刺激包，Radawaye和一堆瓶盖...还不错。}

### {300}{}{...And this is our future? When did we fall so low that even the youth goes against the tribe? The Phoenix missionaries are to blame for this...}
{300}{}{…这就是我们的未来？我们什么时候堕落到连年轻人都反对部落的地步？凤凰城的传教士应该对此负责...}
### {301}{}{It's too late to shout about freedom, Mangas. The chief has made an alliance with the Phoenix. Accept it.}
{301}{}{现在喊自由已经太晚了，曼加斯。首领已与凤凰城结盟。接受它。}
### {302}{}{I look with grief at the future of the tribe. It's covered in fog. We are like a lost brahmin strayed from the herd. Sadly. Very sad.}
{302}{}{我悲痛地看着部落的未来。它被雾笼罩着。我们就像一个迷路的婆罗门。悲哀地非常难过。}
### {303}{}{Yeah. Be there.}
{303}{}{是 啊在那里。}

### {310}{}{I'm asking you to advocate for an alliance with the Phoenix missionaries.}
{310}{}{我请求你倡导与凤凰城传教士结盟。}
### {311}{}{You're delusional, my friend. I am trying to expel outsiders from our land with spells and enlightenment of the minds of my fellow tribesmen. And you ask me to stop and surrender to the will of the Brahmin of Fate.}
{311}{}{你在妄想，我的朋友。我正试图用咒语和我部落同胞的思想启蒙，将外来者驱逐出我们的土地。你让我停下来，向命运的婆罗门的意志投降。}
### {312}{}{That's right.}
{312}{}{没错。}
### {313}{}{If you think about it, it sounds really crazy.}
{313}{}{如果你仔细想想，这听起来真的很疯狂。}
### {314}{}{What's wrong with you, stranger from the Villa? It seems that your village and our tribe are on the same side on the warpath. Isn't that right?}
{314}{}{你怎么了，别墅里的陌生人？看来你们的村庄和我们的部落在战争中是站在同一边的。对不对？}
### {1314}{}{What's wrong with you, Villa woman? It seems that your village and our tribe are on the same side on the warpath. Isn't that right?}
{1314}{}{你怎么了，维拉女人？看来你们的村庄和我们的部落在战争中是站在同一边的。对不对？}
### {315}{}{Unfortunately, Mangas, you are out of touch with reality. The world is changing, and it's still impossible to live anymore.}
{315}{}{不幸的是，曼加斯，你脱离了现实。世界在变化，仍然不可能再活下去。}
### {316}{}{Now you're showing your true face. If your tribe is so weak, let it. But WE will not bend under strangers from Phoenix!}
{316}{}{现在你展现了你的真实面貌。如果你的部落如此软弱，那就顺其自然吧。但我们不会屈服于来自凤凰城的陌生人！}
### {317}{}{In vain. You'll remember my words later.}

### {318}{}{You know best. And I'm leaving.}

### {320}{}{Strong words. They make your hamstrings shake with fear. But if we bend under the New World, we will disappear anyway. Isn't that right?}
{320}{}{措辞强硬。它们会让你的腿筋因恐惧而颤抖。但如果我们屈服于新世界，我们无论如何都会消失。对不对？}
### {321}{}{Make an alliance with the Phoenix and you will keep your traditions. If you stay with the Rangers, you will only condemn yourself to a war with complete defeat.}
{321}{}{与凤凰城结盟，你将保持你的传统。如果你留在流浪者队，你只会让自己陷入一场彻底失败的战争。}
### {322}{}{I don't know. Decide for yourself. Bye.}
{322}{}{我不知道。自己决定。再见}
### {323}{}{The tribe has so far managed to resist missionaries and bandits. But their increasing power presses us more and more. Even united, the tribe barely holds on to the San Brahmin.}
{323}{}{到目前为止，这个部落已经设法抵抗了传教士和土匪。但他们日益强大的力量越来越迫使我们。即使联合起来，这个部落也几乎无法留住圣婆罗门。}
### {324}{}{So be it. For the sake of saving my clan, I will stand for the union. But I will also maintain an alliance with the Rangers. And at the first sign of a threat, we will break all agreements.}
{324}{}{就这样吧。为了拯救我的家族，我将代表联盟。但我也会和流浪者队保持联盟关系。一旦出现威胁迹象，我们就会破坏所有协议。}
### {325}{}{A reasonable solution.}

{327}{}{相信我，流浪者队不是你的朋友，凤凰队无论如何都会赢。你别无选择，否则你会死在沙子里。}
### {328}{}{I listen to your words and I am more and more grieved... Is it really so bad that even the Villa is ready to bend under the Phoenix? Then we really have no choice.}
{328}{}{听着你的话，我越来越难过...就连维拉都准备在凤凰城下屈服，真的这么糟糕吗？那我们真的别无选择。}
### {329}{}{I don't know anymore, Mangas... I need to collect my thoughts.}
{329}{}{我不知道了，曼加斯...我需要收集我的想法。}
### {330}{}{Of course. And until you convince me otherwise, I will speak at the council for an alliance with the Rangers. They are the ones who wish us well.}
{330}{}{当然在你说服我之前，我会在理事会上发言，争取与流浪者队结盟。他们是祝福我们的人。}
### {331}{}{Okay. Bye.}
{331}{}{可以再见}
### {332}{}{And if I bring you proof of their treachery?}
{332}{}{如果我给你他们背信弃义的证据？}
### {333}{}{Well, I will listen. But don't you dare lie to me.}
{333}{}{好吧，我会听的。但是你不敢对我撒谎。}
### {334}{}{Okay. Bye.}

### {336}{}{Oh, why is the Divine Brahmin of Fate so cruel!}
{336}{}{哦，为什么命运的神圣婆罗门如此残忍！}
