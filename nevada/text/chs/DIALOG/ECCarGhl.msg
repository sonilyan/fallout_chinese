#{100}{}{You see a ghoul.}
{100}{}{你看到一个食尸鬼。}
#{101}{}{You see a local resident.}
{101}{}{你看到一个当地居民。}
#{110}{}{Whoa, welcome to sparkling Vegas, wanderer!}
{110}{}{哇，欢迎来到闪耀的维加斯，流浪者！}
#{111}{}{Vegas? It's just a junkyard, you weirdo!}
{111}{}{维加斯？只是个垃圾场，你这个怪人！}
#{112}{}{Vegas? Oh, yeah, sounds great.}
{112}{}{维加斯？哦，是的，听起来不错。}
#{113}{}{Vegas is everywhere, just take a look around! Isn't it beautiful?}
{113}{}{维加斯到处都是，看看吧！很漂亮吧？}
#{114}{}{You're a raving lunatic, wonderful. But I don't care. Do you have any tires for my wheels?}
{114}{}{你是个疯狂的疯子，太棒了。但我不在乎。你有我的轮胎吗？}
#{115}{}{Oh yes. Beautiful indeed. Tell me, do you by any chance have tires for my wheels?}
{115}{}{哦，是的。真漂亮。告诉我，你有我的轮胎吗？}
#{116}{}{No.}
{116}{}{不。}
#{117}{}{Uh... No? Really? What the hell are those things, lying around in heaps?!}
{117}{}{Uh...不？真正地？那些东西到底是什么东西，成堆地躺着？！}
#{118}{}{Hah, my dear friend, why would anyone dump *good* tires in a *junkyard*? If they were of any use, they wouldn't be lying around here!}
{118}{}{哈，我亲爱的朋友，为什么有人会把好轮胎扔到垃圾场？如果它们有用的话，它们就不会躺在这里了！}
#{119}{}{Hmm...}
{119}{}{Hmm...}
#{120}{}{But what I *do* have for your wheels are these here hands, and some nifty gizmos to go with them... That is, if you really got wheels...}
{120}{}{但我为你的轮子准备的是这双手和一些漂亮的小玩意儿...也就是说，如果你真的有轮子...}
#{121}{}{What are you talking about?}
{121}{}{你在说什么？}
#{122}{}{No, I was only looking for tires. Take care.}
{122}{}{不，我只是在找轮胎。当心。}
#{123}{}{You're just crazy. What can you make out of junk, other than some more junk!?}
{123}{}{你疯了。除了更多的垃圾，你还能从垃圾中做什么！？}
#{124}{}{I'm not crazy, I'm full of ideas! These two are often confused, so don't feel bad about that. You see, I might just be the last engineer on this godforsaken planet!}
{124}{}{我没有疯，我充满了想法！这两个经常混淆，所以不要为此感到难过。你看，我可能是这个该死的星球上最后一个工程师！}
#{125}{}{I see... What exactly are you offering?}
{125}{}{我懂了...你到底提供什么？}
#{126}{}{You got a ride? Oh, I see you do. Well... It's rather primitive, but I still got the itch to do some things to it. Just pick from the list of options!}
{126}{}{你有车吗？哦，我知道你知道。好...它很原始，但我还是很想对它做点什么。从选项列表中选择！}
#{127}{}{You got a ride? Oh... Pity you don't. See, I got this itch for engineering!}
{127}{}{你有车吗？哦...可惜你没有。看，我对工程很感兴趣！}
#{128}{}{Great, let's perform an inspection.}
{128}{}{太好了，我们来检查一下。}
#{129}{}{I'm not interested in all that right now. What I am interested in is this Chryslus Motors catalog. Can you tell me anything about it?}
{129}{}{我现在对这些都不感兴趣。我感兴趣的是这个克莱斯勒汽车公司的目录。你能告诉我有关这件事的情况吗？}
#{130}{}{Huh, the car ain't exactly brand new, is it? When it rolled out off the Chryslus factory, I was probably still crapping in my pants. Yeah, those were the days... Now, what do you want me to do - powerful headlights, fuel cell regulator, bigger trunk maybe?}
{130}{}{嗯，这辆车不是全新的，是吗？当它从Chryslus工厂出来的时候，我可能还在裤子里拉屎。是啊，那些日子...现在，你想让我怎么做-强大的头灯，燃料电池调节器，可能更大的后备箱？}
#{131}{}{Tell me about headlights.}
{131}{}{告诉我车头灯的事。}
#{132}{}{Tell me about that fuel thingie.}
{132}{}{告诉我燃料的事。}
#{133}{}{Tell me about the trunk.}
{133}{}{告诉我后备箱的事。}
#{134}{}{I don't need any of these.}
{134}{}{我不需要这些。}
#{135}{}{A couple of massive halogen lamps on your hood never go out of fashion. It's not too comfortable driving at night when there's no roads anymore, don't you agree? I could install them, no sweat. The question is, what will I get in return.}
{135}{}{引擎盖上的几盏大尺寸卤素灯永远不会过时。晚上没有路的时候开车不太舒服，你同意吗？我可以安装它们，不费吹灰之力。问题是，我会得到什么回报。}
#{136}{}{Oh yes, I'd like that!}
{136}{}{哦，是的，我喜欢！}
#{137}{}{Not now. What else did you say you could do?}
{137}{}{不是现在。你说你还能做什么？}
#{138}{}{Your car eats up loads of fuel and half of the energy goes to heating up the wasteland, right? Oh yeah, I know how it feels! I also know how to make it stop draining your batteries like a short fuse. The question here, what will I get in return.}
{138}{}{你的车消耗了大量的燃料，一半的能量用来加热荒地，对吧？哦，是的，我知道那种感觉！我也知道如何让它停止像短路保险丝一样耗尽你的电池。这里的问题是，我会得到什么回报。}
#{139}{}{That'll take some work, but I could do it. Your trunk is quite roomy, and you could fit a dozen or so debtors in there all their gear included, but sometimes it's still just not enough, am I right? A leather canopy will let you stuff about 20% more loot in there. But you'll have to motivate me, if you know what I mean.}
{139}{}{那需要一些工作，但我可以做。你的后备箱很宽敞，你可以放十几个欠债的人，包括他们所有的装备，但有时还是不够，对吗？一个皮质的顶篷可以让你在里面多装20%的战利品。但如果你明白我的意思，你就得激励我。}
#{140}{}{Hmm! I didn't have to read in quite a long while. I wouldn't remember the letters, but if you read it to me, I'll try to make some use of it.}
{140}{}{隐马尔可夫模型！我不用花很长时间看书。我不记得那些信了，但如果你读给我听，我会尽量利用它的。}
#{141}{}{Great, let's do that.}
{141}{}{太好了，我们来吧。}
#{142}{}{Just like that? No-no, I got to have a hot meal and wet my whistle first. My head doesn't work right on an empty stomach.}
{142}{}{就这样？不，不，我得先吃顿热腾腾的饭，然后打湿口哨。我空腹时脑子不正常。}
#{143}{}{Whatever.}
{143}{}{无论什么。}
#{144}{}{Wait a little then - we'll talk about it later.}
{144}{}{那就等一下-我们稍后再谈。}
#{145}{}{You changed your mind yet? Too bad!}
{145}{}{你改变主意了吗？太糟糕了！}
#{146}{}{Tell me about your car options again.}
{146}{}{再告诉我一次你的汽车选择。}
#{147}{}{Maybe. But I'm leaving anyway.}
{147}{}{也许 吧。但我还是要走了。}
#{148}{}{Oh yes, that should be enough! Go warm yourself by that barrel while I finish working on this baby...}
{148}{}{哦，是的，应该够了！当我把这个孩子弄完的时候，你自己去取暖吧...}
#{149}{}{Just be careful, alright?}
{149}{}{小心点，好吗？}
#{150}{}{Holy Chryslus! It works! I can't believe this!}
{150}{}{我的天哪！真管用！真不敢相信！}
#{151}{}{What, really?}
{151}{}{什么，真的？}
#{152}{}{Job's done! The pick-up will now use energy more efficiently.}
{152}{}{任务完成了！皮卡现在将更有效地利用能源。}
#{153}{}{Now your car lights its way with new headlights.}
{153}{}{现在你的车用新的头灯照亮了方向。}
#{154}{}{This canopy will serve you good, increasing your trunk's capacity by }
{154}{}{这个顶棚可以很好的为你服务，增加你后备箱的容量}
#{155}{}{Hmm...}
{155}{}{Hmm...}
#{156}{}{[-more-]}
{156}{}{[-更多-]}
#{157}{}{20%.}
{157}{}{20%.}
#{158}{}{Okay, what do you want?}
{158}{}{好吧，你想要什么？}
#{159}{}{What snacks and booze have you got?}
{159}{}{你有什么零食和酒？}
#{160}{}{[Look for liquor in your backpack]}
{160}{}{[在背包里找酒]}
#{161}{}{[Look for food in your backpack]}
{161}{}{[在背包里寻找食物]}
#{162}{}{Nothing like that. I'll go get some.}
{162}{}{不是那样的。我去拿一些。}
#{163}{}{Forget it. What did you say about my car?}
{163}{}{算了吧。你说我的车怎么样？}
#{164}{}{You already had as much as a deathclaw could eat in a week. I dare you, ask me for food again!}
{164}{}{一个星期内你已经吃了一只死爪所能吃的东西了。我敢说，你又向我要食物了！}
#{165}{}{Hey, easy, buddy! I might have pushed it a little too far. Can you blame me? Oh, don't give me that look.}
{165}{}{嘿，别紧张，伙计！我可能有点过分了。你能怪我吗？哦，别那样看我。}
#{166}{}{Shut your blowhole and get to work.}
{166}{}{闭上你的气孔开始工作。}
#{167}{}{Articles on "Chryslus Motors" vehicles proved to be quite useful. You got some tips on increasing your car's speed and maximum carried weight.}
{167}{}{关于“Chryslus Motors”车辆的文章被证明是非常有用的。你有一些提高车速和最大载重量的建议。}
#{168}{}{Need anything else?}
{168}{}{还需要什么吗？}
#{169}{}{Forget about food. Let's talk about my car.}
{169}{}{忘了食物吧。我们谈谈我的车吧。}
#{170}{}{You'll have to deal with it. Bye.}
{170}{}{你必须处理它。再见。}

{171}{}{[给我啤酒]}
#{172}{}{[Give booze]}
{172}{}{[喝酒]}
#{173}{}{[Give Rot Gut]}
{173}{}{[给我肠子]}

#{181}{}{Oh yeah! It's always good to snatch a bite before work. Even if it's not much, right?}
{181}{}{哦，是的！上班前咬一口总是好的。即使不多，对吧？}
#{182}{}{Wait, you mean it wasn't enough for you?}
{182}{}{等等，你是说对你来说还不够？}
#{183}{}{Oh yeah! Some fuel in the system - just what a mechanic needs, right? Well, at least for starters.}
{183}{}{哦，是的！系统里有些燃料-这正是机修工需要的，对吧？嗯，至少对初学者来说是这样。}
#{184}{}{Won't you burn up from this much "fuel"?}
{184}{}{你不会因为这么多“燃料”而燃烧起来吗？}
#{185}{}{You're still not full?!}
{185}{}{你还没吃饱？！}
#{186}{}{Oh yeah, that's a hell of a ride.}
{186}{}{哦，是的，那是一个地狱般的旅程。}
#{187}{}{You bet...}
{187}{}{当然...}
#{190}{}{Oh, yeah... }
{190}{}{哦，是的...}
#{191}{}{I see your headlights are shining like the sun out of your ass, hah!}
{191}{}{我看见你的前灯像太阳一样从你屁股里射出来，哈！}
#{192}{}{You don't need a new regulator - the one you got should serve you just fine for a many a mile yet.}
{192}{}{你不需要一个新的调节器-你的调节器应该可以为你服务好几英里。}
#{193}{}{Well, apparently, you don't need a better trunk. What a pity. }
{193}{}{显然，你不需要一个更好的后备箱。真遗憾。}
#{194}{}{So what do you want?}
{194}{}{那你想要什么？}
#{1110}{}{Whoa, welcome to sparkling Vegas, precious!}
