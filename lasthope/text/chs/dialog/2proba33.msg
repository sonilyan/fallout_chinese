### {108}{}{Well, I used to travel a lot. After many years I just got tired of it and wanted to settle down for a while. This place looked very nice. [Smiles.] The air smells a whole lot better, plenty of water supplies... a small oasis, you know, like before the war. Villagers from around accepted me with great hospitality. Learned many skills from the locals. They know how to treat injuries with plants better than doctors do with all their fancy technology. Most people treat them bad. But once you get to know these simple people, you'll start to understand what life is all about.}
{108}{}{嗯，我以前经常旅行。多年后，我只是厌倦了它，想安定下来一段时间。这个地方看起来很不错。空气闻起来好多了，有充足的水源。。。一个小绿洲，你知道，就像战前一样。周围的村民热情好客地接受了我。从当地人那里学到了很多技能。他们知道如何用植物治疗损伤，比医生用他们所有的花哨技术做得更好。大多数人对他们不好。但一旦你了解了这些简单的人，你就会开始理解生活的意义。}
### {109}{}{I guess it's not all about alternative healing methods, grassroots and natural resources... So what do you do here?}
{109}{}{我想这并不全是关于替代治疗方法、草根和自然资源。。。你在这里做什么？}

### {112}{}{Why no, I don't think I heard of them. Who are they?}
{112}{}{为什么没有，我想我没听说过他们。他们是谁？}
### {113}{}{I've heard they were involved in some criminal activities in Farmers Town...}
{113}{}{我听说他们在农民镇参与了一些犯罪活动。。。}
### {114}{}{I heard they have a caravan camp near this place, so I wanted to ask for a job.}

### {116}{}{Let me ask you something else then.}

### {124}{}{I'm open for business when I'm out there at my table. NOT when I'm in my pajamas.}
