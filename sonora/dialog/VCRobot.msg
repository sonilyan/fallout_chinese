#The first dialog
### {200}{}{Ah, finally! It's been a long time since I've seen the faces of living people. Decades of loneliness do not pass without a trace, even for my neural connections... Who are you? Tell me about yourself?}

### {202}{}{ from the Villa. And that's who you are... or WHAT are you?}

### {203}{}{Lo siento, mi joven descendiente. Technically, I'm a car from the Old Days. But more importantly, I am the personality of Felix Tejada, your direct ancestor. Don't worry, great-great-grandson. Once there were plenty of such robots all over the continent.}
{203}{}{Lo siento，我喜欢下降。严格来说，我是一辆旧时代的车。但更重要的是，我是费利克斯・特贾达的个性，你的直系祖先。别担心，曾曾孙。曾经整个大陆都有很多这样的机器人。}

{218}{}{多么悲伤。。。我告诉看守人，再也不可能住在金库里了。}

### {220}{}{Why are you being hidden here?}
{220}{}{你为什么被藏在这里？}

### {223}{}{There was nothing to repair them, there was nowhere to find a replacement for them or energy sources. The necessary parts would have to be extracted in dangerous irradiated ruins, and this would have a sad effect on the health of residents. In addition, over time, people have lost their knowledge of the Old World, and ignorance leads to sad mistakes.}
{223}{}{没有什么可以修复的，也没有地方可以找到替代品或能源。必须在危险的辐照废墟中提取必要的部分，这将对居民的健康产生可悲的影响。此外，随着时间的推移，人们已经失去了对旧世界的了解，无知导致了可悲的错误。}
### {224}{}{I'm listening.}

### {230}{}{Tell me how the Villa appeared?}
{230}{}{告诉我别墅是怎么出现的？}
