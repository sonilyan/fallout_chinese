{100}{}{[脸上带着微笑看了你一会儿。]嗯，嗯，嗯。。。看看我们这里有什么。所以，是你把反对奴隶制的战争搞得一团糟。。。我真的没什么印象，其他事情引起了我的注意。。。你的决心帮助那些来自荒原监狱的混蛋。。。你真的认为你做的是对的吗？ -- [Looks at you for a moment with a smile on his face.] Well, well, well...

{103}{}{你试过听…吗。。。？听着，你活着只是因为他们希望你活着。事实证明，在外界充当告密者对他们来说是一个更好的选择，因为你什么都不懂，只做别人告诉你的事。他们利用你来制定计划，不管他们是什么。。。但一旦你不再被需要，你就会消失，就像你之前的许多人一样。。。 -- Do you ever try to listen...?
