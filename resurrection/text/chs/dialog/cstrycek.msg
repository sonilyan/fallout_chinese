#{550}{}{I have a proposition for you. As you have undoubtedly found out, I am trying to eliminate Nestor. Corath is too small for the two of us. Only one can remain.

#{951}{}{What will you do once Nestor leaves the city?}
{951}{}{一旦内斯特离开这座城市，你会怎么做？}
#{952}{}{What do you want to do now that you have Corath to yourself?}
{952}{}{你现在有了科拉斯你想做什么？}
#{953}{}{Your accountant Morton told me you have a monopoly on the trade with Sedit here in Corath. How did you manage it - so that the caravan companies only buy ore from you?}
{953}{}{你的会计莫顿告诉我你在科拉斯和塞迪特的交易上有垄断权。你是怎么做到的，以至于商队公司只从你这里购买矿石？}
#{954}{}{I can't think of anything. I better go.}
{954}{}{我什么都想不出来。我得走了。}
#{1000}{}{[He frowns.] Mate, you come back when you're yourself again. I have nothing to say to you in this state.}

{1001}{}{[他皱眉]女孩，当你重新恢复自我时你会回来的。在这种情况下我没什么好说的。}
#{1002}{}{Ugh.}
{1002}{}{啊。}
#{1050}{}{As the formal challenger, I will take possession of his mine. After that, I will finally control the mining of iron ore and I will not need to share my sales profits with anyone. The whole of Corath will prosper with me.}
{1050}{}{作为正式的挑战者，我将占有他的矿。之后，我将最终控制铁矿石的开采，我将不需要与任何人分享我的销售利润。整个科拉斯都会和我一起繁荣。}
#{1051}{}{There is one more thing. Your accountant Morton told me you have a monopoly on the trade with Sedit here in Corath. How did you manage it - so that the caravan companies only buy ore from you?}

#{1052}{}{I'm sure. See you, Uncle.}
{1052}{}{我肯定。再见，叔叔。}
#{1100}{}{There is no mystery there. My entire success is based on a simple truth I came to understand back when I travelled with my own caravan. Every acquisition and sale is mainly about negotiating. Over the years I've come to understand when to be tough and when to withdraw. If you can convince a raider or a stranger who doesn't even speak your language to trade with you, you can even convince the proud companies of Sedit to close a good contract with you. It's just a game you play with a fixed set of rules. As soon as you master them, the way to riches is wide open.}
{1100}{}{那里没有什么神秘的东西。我的全部成功是建立在一个简单的事实上的，当我带着自己的大篷车旅行时，我明白了这个道理。每一次收购和出售主要是谈判。这些年来，我逐渐明白什么时候该强硬，什么时候该退出。如果你能说服一个甚至不会说你的语言的袭击者或陌生人与你交易，你甚至可以说服Sedit引以为豪的公司与你签订一份好合同。这只是一个游戏，你玩一套固定的规则。一旦你掌握了它们，致富之路就敞开了。}
#{1101}{}{That's good to know. What will you do once Nestor leaves the city?}

{1200}{}{[他脸上露出惊讶的表情]那是出乎意料的。我想我知道是谁派你来的。但我能知道你的借口是什么吗？}

Although I would like to know where he'd need to crawl under with all his hired killers so as not to attract unwanted attention. But I doubt he would have gone far. I guess he just withdrew to one of the surrounding towns where he's trying to recruit enough mercenaries to attack Corath. Try Sedit or Albuquerque.}
{1550}{}{不幸的是，我不知道他藏身处的确切位置。尽管我想知道他需要在哪里和他雇佣的杀手混在一起以免引起不必要的注意。但我怀疑他会走得很远。我猜他刚刚撤退到附近的一个城镇，在那里他试图招募足够的雇佣军来攻击科拉斯。试试塞迪特或阿尔伯克基。}
#{1551}{}{I'll look for him there.}
{1551}{}{我在那里找他。}
#{1600}{}{I suggest eliminating Nestor as soon as possible. You mustn't give him time to regain strength. As proof of his demise, bring me back his golden tooth. I'd like to have something to remember him by. [He smiles his widest smile.]}
{1600}{}{我建议尽快淘汰内斯特。你不能给他时间恢复体力。作为他死亡的证据，把他的金牙还给我。我想借点东西来纪念他。[他笑得最灿烂。]}
#{1601}{}{I suggest eliminating Nestor as soon as possible. You mustn't give him time to regain strength. As proof of his demise, bring me back his golden tooth. I'd like to have something to remember him by. [He smiles his widest smile.}
{1601}{}{我建议尽快淘汰内斯特。你不能给他时间恢复体力。作为他死亡的证据，把他的金牙还给我。我想借点东西来纪念他。[他笑得最灿烂。}
#{1602}{}{OK, Uncle, you'll get your souvenir.}
{1602}{}{好的，叔叔，你会拿到纪念品的。}
#{1603}{}{And have it you shall. Before I go, can I ask you something?}
{1603}{}{你应该拥有它。在我走之前，我能问你一件事吗？}
#{1650}{}{As the formal challenger, I have been awarded with Nestor's mine. Now I finally control the extraction of iron ore and I don't have to split the profits with anyone. The whole of Corath will prosper from my wealth.}
{1650}{}{作为正式的挑战者，我获得了内斯特的奖章。现在我终于控制了铁矿石的开采，我不必和任何人分享利润。我的财富将使整个科拉斯兴旺发达。}
#{1651}{}{I'm sure it will. I'll be going now.}
{1651}{}{我肯定会的。我要走了。}
#{1700}{}{Not a wise decision, but it's what you have chosen. At any rate, make sure to be careful.}
{1700}{}{这不是一个明智的决定，但这是你的选择。无论如何，一定要小心。}
#{1701}{}{Don't worry about me. Bye.}
{1701}{}{别担心我。再见。}
#{1702}{}{Ugh.}
{1702}{}{啊。}
#{1750}{}{[A look of surprise forms on his face.] Well, that is unexpected. I think I know who sent you. But may I know what your excuse is?}
{1750}{}{[他脸上露出惊讶的表情]好吧，那是出乎意料的。我想我知道是谁派你来的。但我能知道你的借口是什么吗？}
#{1751}{}{I was sent by Nestor. He asks for your exile from the city because of the miner unrest you helped provoke through Richie. Nestor's people are already taking care of the formalities with the police and Lawteller.}
{1751}{}{我是内斯特派来的。他要求你从城里流放出去，因为你通过里奇挑起了矿工骚乱。内斯特的人已经在处理警察和律师的手续了。}
#{1752}{}{I was sent by Nestor. He asks for your exile from the city because of the miner unrest you were trying to provoke through Richie. Nestor's people are already taking care of the formalities with the police and Lawteller.}
{1752}{}{我是内斯特派来的。他要求你离开城市，因为你试图通过里奇挑起矿工骚乱。内斯特的人已经在处理警察和律师的手续了。}
#{1753}{}{I was sent by Nestor. He asks for your exile from the city for having a man named Richie killed. Nestor's people are already taking care of the formalities with the police and Lawteller.}
{1753}{}{我是内斯特派来的。他要求你离开这个城市，因为你杀了一个叫里奇的人。内斯特的人已经在处理警察和律师的手续了。}
#{1754}{}{I have no time for this. I'll just kill you!}
{1754}{}{我没时间做这个。我就杀了你！}
#{1755}{}{Oh forget it. Bye.}
{1755}{}{算了吧。再见。}
#{1800}{}{Good to see you again. What brings you here?}
{1800}{}{很高兴再次见到你。什么风把你吹来了？}
#{1801}{}{I've thought about what you said. Nestor really needs to be killed. But first I need to know where to look for him.}
{1801}{}{我考虑过你说的话。内斯特真的需要被杀。但首先我要知道去哪里找他。}
#{1802}{}{I've thought about what you said. Nestor really needs to be killed. But first I need to know where to look for him.}

#{1804}{}{Can I ask you something?}
{1804}{}{我能问你件事吗？}
#{1805}{}{I just wanted to say "hi".}
{1805}{}{我只是想说声“嗨”。}
#{1806}{}{I just wanted to say "hi".}
{1806}{}{我只是想说声“嗨”。}
#{1807}{}{Ugh.}
{1807}{}{啊。}
#{1850}{}{Well, tell me. I'm all ears.}
{1850}{}{好吧，告诉我。我洗耳恭听。}
#{1851}{}{He's dead. He sends his regards, and also this. [Give him Nestor's gold tooth.]}
{1851}{}{他死了。他向你问好，还有这个。[把内斯特的金牙给他。]}
#{1852}{}{Oh, it's nothing. I have to go now.}
{1852}{}{哦，没什么。我得走了。}
#{1900}{}{[He inspects the tooth carefully.] So Nestor's no longer in the land of the living. I must say, that takes a load off me. Even without his iron mine he was a dangerous enemy. You've done a damn fine job. [He gives you 4000 caps.] You deserve every last one of them.}
{1900}{}{[他仔细检查牙齿]所以内斯特已经不在活人的土地上了。我必须说，这减轻了我的负担。即使没有他的铁矿，他也是一个危险的敌人。你做得很好。[他给了你4000顶瓶盖]你配得上每一顶。}

#{1902}{}{Thanks. I'll put them to good use.}
{1902}{}{谢谢。我会好好利用它们的。}
#{1950}{}{I have no more work for you. I'm grateful for your services. Remember, you'll always be welcome in this city. At least as long as I'm in charge.}
{1950}{}{我没有更多的工作给你了。我很感谢你的服务。记住，这个城市永远欢迎你。至少在我负责的时候。}

{1953}{}{谢谢你。在我走之前，我能问你一件事吗？}
#{2000}{}{Oh, hello. Cedrick warned me you'd be strange, but he didn't mention how much. Auntie is not in right now, but I have your reward for you. [He gives you the caps.] Enjoy them any way you can.}
{2000}{}{哦，你好。塞德里克警告过我你会很奇怪，但他没说有多奇怪。阿姨现在不在，但我有你的赏金给你。[他给你瓶盖]尽情享受吧。}
#{2001}{}{Thankee Uncle!}
{2001}{}{谢谢叔叔！}

{2050}{}{是的，我是你叔叔，我需要你的帮助。你打败了那个邪恶的变种人，但他的主人内斯特仍然逍遥法外。你能帮我找到他然后杀了他吗？这对我真的很有帮助。}

{2052}{}{}
#{2053}{}{ will do for uncle!}
{2053}{}{会为叔叔做的！}
#{2054}{}{Ugm, must that?}
{2054}{}{嗯，一定是吗？}
#{2100}{}{I knew you wouldn't fail your uncle. Nestor will likely hide among murderers and criminals. That is where he belongs now. Oh, and bring me something to remember him by. I would like to get his gold tooth. Do you understand?}
{2100}{}{我就知道你不会辜负你叔叔。内斯特很可能躲在杀人犯和罪犯中间。那是他现在的归属。哦，给我带点东西来纪念他。我想要他的金牙。你明白吗？}
