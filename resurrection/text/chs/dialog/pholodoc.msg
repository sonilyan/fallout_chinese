#{100}{}{You see a hologram.}
{100}{}{你看到全息图了。}
#{200}{}{You see a hologram of a scientist. The picture is not very clear and the colors are off.}
{200}{}{你看到一个科学家的全息图。这幅画不太清楚，颜色也不好。}
#{300}{}{Hi there, my name is Geoff Sommers and I work... actually I used to work on the main project.}
{300}{}{你好，我叫杰夫・索默斯，我在。。。事实上我以前在主项目上工作。}
#{301}{}{We've received orders to seal the entire base immediately. No one has told us what's going on. But if anyone is listening to this recording, I can only suppose I've been replaced and you will carry on with my work.}
{301}{}{我们接到命令立即封锁整个基地。没人告诉我们发生了什么。但如果有人在听这段录音，我只能假设我被替换了，你会继续我的工作。}
#{302}{}{All the relevant data and records are stored in the computer. But allow me also to tell you my personal opinion.}
{302}{}{所有相关的数据和记录都存储在计算机中。但也请允许我告诉你我个人的看法。}
#{303}{}{So far we've failed to modify the genes of the creature using any other biological safeguard than the telomerase knock-out feature, which will kill all individuals in 200 years. And that is indeed very little. The organism we have developed is resisting any other changes.}
{303}{}{到目前为止，除了端粒酶基因敲除功能外，我们还没有使用任何其他生物保护措施来修改这种生物的基因，而端粒酶基因敲除功能将在200年内杀死所有的个体。这确实是很少的。我们进化出的有机体正在抵抗任何其他的变化。}
#{304}{}{In my opinion we should kill it and start from scratch. But the army is thrilled by its efficient killing abilities. Luckily they are smart enough to wait for us to develop some better biological safeguard. At least for now. What frightens me is one day they might become too frustrated to wait any more.}
{304}{}{在我看来，我们应该消灭它，从头开始。但军队对其高效的杀戮能力感到兴奋。幸运的是，它们足够聪明，可以等待我们开发出更好的生物保护措施。至少现在是这样。让我害怕的是，总有一天他们可能会因为太沮丧而等不及了。}
#{305}{}{I sometimes have nightmares where the creature escapes. I've even bought a high-powered laser pistol. I know we are forbidden to carry weapons, as there are soldiers for our protection, but I want something to defend myself with if something goes wrong, even though it most likely wouldn't save me.}
{305}{}{我有时会做恶梦，梦见那生物逃跑了。我甚至买了一把大功率激光手枪。我知道我们是被禁止携带武器的，因为有士兵保护我们，但是如果出了什么问题，我想用一些东西来保护自己，尽管它很可能救不了我。}
#{306}{}{I hope you will not disclose my little secret; perhaps you will even appreciate the pistol. I will leave it in my office on the first floor. It's taped to the top of the first drawer in my desk.}
{306}{}{我希望你不要泄露我的小秘密，也许你会喜欢这把手枪。我会把它放在一楼的办公室里。它贴在我书桌第一个抽屉的上面。}
#{307}{}{Good luck, colleague.}
{307}{}{祝你好运，同事。}
