### {226}{}{Damn coyotes. I don't know what they smelled, but there's a whole pack of them. I'm afraid to get too close. And after all, all my tools are in my house. Will you help me get rid of the coyotes? I'll pay five caps for each of them if I just get to my place.}
{226}{}{该死的郊狼。我不知道它们闻起来是什么味道，但有一整包。我怕离得太近。毕竟，我所有的工具都在我家里。你能帮我赶走郊狼吗？如果我刚到我的住处，我会为他们每人支付五个瓶盖。}

{242}{}{在我看来，它们是用你在工厂附近收集的废金属制成的。你对此怎么说？}
### {243}{}{Hush! Don't tell anyone. Don't you care where and how these bottlecaps were produced? The pre-war caps are already rusted, but at least these are intact. Take it and keep quiet. No one will believe you anyway.}
{243}{}{安静不要告诉任何人。你不在乎这些瓶子是在哪里以及如何生产的吗？战前的瓶盖已经生锈了，但至少这些完好无损。拿着它，保持安静。不管怎样，没有人会相信你。}
### {244}{}{I'm not judging you. Just be careful next time. Happily.}
{244}{}{我不是在评判你。下次一定要小心。高兴地}
### {245}{}{Silence is expensive. For 100 caps, I will close my eyes to this case.}
{245}{}{沉默是昂贵的。对于100个瓶盖，我会闭上眼睛看这个案子。}

### {250}{}{Tell me about the Garage.}

### {252}{}{Sounds good.}
{252}{}{听起来不错。}
### {253}{}{But the mine is completely depleted. It seems that soon you will have to collect things and look for new ruins, if the city suddenly does not have an additional source of income.}
{253}{}{但矿井已经完全枯竭。如果这座城市突然没有额外的收入来源，你似乎很快就会不得不收集东西，寻找新的废墟。}
### {254}{}{And what do you get in exchange for work? Corn cobs?}
{254}{}{你用什么来换取工作？玉米棒？}
### {255}{}{caps, redneck! bottlecaps! We use them the way we used money in ancient times. Hmm. It wouldn't hurt for you to get a wallet, too. Remember - now nothing goes without caps in big cities.}
{255}{}{瓶盖，红脖子！装瓶！我们使用它们就像我们在古代使用金钱一样。嗯。你也可以买个钱包。记住，在大城市里，没有什么是没有上限的。}
