### {261}{027}{Where's the rationality in that? You are low on people. And it's obvious that G and his fellas are not great at fights - yet - but you can use them as scouts! Put them around the Rainbow, so they could monitor the situation everywhere. There are threats in Radius except for the Jackals, you know... Did I mention that you can pay them less than grown-ups?}
