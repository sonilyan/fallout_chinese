{100}{}{这是一位游骑兵将军。}
### {101}{}{You see a strong gray-haired old man who has seen life in all its manifestations.}
{101}{}{你看到的是一位头发花白的强壮老人，他看到了生命的一切表现。}
### {102}{}{I'm used to talking to real people, not robots. Do you understand?}
{102}{}{我习惯于和真人说话，而不是和机器人说话。你明白吗？}
### {103}{}{Goodbye, Ranger. Your ideals have turned out... not viable.}
{103}{}{再见，游骑兵。你的理想已经实现了...不可行。}
### {104}{}{Sorry, but this lady needs to cool down a bit.}
{104}{}{对不起，这位女士需要冷静一下。}
### {105}{}{Glad to see you in good health. But I'm not in the mood to talk right now-the evil sown by the Brotherhood still glows in the wastelands.}
{105}{}{很高兴看到你身体健康。但我现在没有心情谈论兄弟会播下的邪恶仍然在荒原上发光。}

#The first dialog
### {200}{}{I was informed that a certain peasant was seeking a meeting with me on an important issue. But usually scouts and ambassadors are engaged in external contacts. So I hope it's really something important?}
{200}{}{有人告诉我，一个农民想和我就一个重要问题会面。但通常情况下，侦察兵和大使都会与外界接触。所以我希望这真的很重要？}
### {1200}{}{I was informed that a certain peasant woman was seeking a meeting with me on an important issue. But usually scouts and ambassadors are engaged in external contacts. So I hope it's really something important?}

### {202}{}{So, why are you here?}

{204}{}{这个笑话听起来很可笑。}

### {212}{}{Good heavens, judging by your appearance, you've taken a lot of heat by the ruthless Wasteland. I'm really sorry.}
{212}{}{天啊，从你的外表来看，你已经被无情的荒原激怒了。我真的很抱歉。}
### {213}{}{Thank you, General, for your kind words. Most would just send me away.}
{213}{}{将军，谢谢你的客气话。大多数人都会把我打发走。}

#The criminal's family
### {220}{}{One angry woman demanded your meeting.}
{220}{}{一个愤怒的女人要求你们见面。}
### {221}{}{Yes, I was informed. I endlessly sympathize with such people, but nothing can be done. Families of criminals have always been branded, even in the Old World.}
{221}{}{是的，我接到通知了。我对这些人感同身受，但无能为力。罪犯的家庭总是被打上烙印，即使在旧世界也是如此。}
### {222}{}{There must be a way to resolve the conflict.}
{222}{}{必须有办法解决冲突。}
### {223}{}{Me сomming out won't change anything. This woman will always hate the Rangers, no matter how much good we have done her. And in the neighboring settlements, the locals will not give her life if they find out about her husband's dark past.}
{223}{}{我放弃不会改变任何事情。这个女人会永远恨流浪者队，不管我们对她做了多少好事。在邻近的定居点，如果当地人发现她丈夫的黑暗过去，他们不会给她生命。}
### {224}{}{Continue.}
{224}{}{持续}
### {225}{}{You are developing an interesting idea.}
{225}{}{你正在发展一个有趣的想法。}
### {226}{}{I'm afraid the only way out for this family is to leave the Sonoran lands and go east to California, where they can start all over again.}
{226}{}{恐怕这个家庭唯一的出路就是离开索诺兰地区，向东去加利福尼亚，在那里他们可以重新开始。}
### {227}{}{I will try to convey this idea to her.}
{227}{}{我会尽力把这个想法传达给她。}
### {228}{}{Maybe not the worst idea.}
{228}{}{也许不是最糟糕的主意。}

#Lone Ranger in Flagstaff
### {230}{}{What is Ranger Keruk doing in Flagstaff?}
{230}{}{Ranger Keruk在Flagstaff做什么？}
### {231}{}{(sighs) Our walking trouble with a rifle on the back. The General Staff was against sabotage in Flagstaff, but one ranger's personal ambitions were higher than the charter. It's hard to blame him for that.}
{231}{}{（叹了口气）背上背着一支步枪，我们走路很麻烦。总参谋部反对弗拉格斯塔夫的破坏活动，但一名护林员的个人野心高于宪章。很难为此责怪他。}
### {232}{}{Do you justify him?}
{232}{}{你为他辩护吗？}
### {233}{}{Keruk had a difficult fate due to the enslavement of his village. Apparently, he found a way in Flagstaff to get revenge for his past. We let him go so that he could make sense of his life and find peace of mind.}
{233}{}{由于村庄被奴役，克鲁克的命运很艰难。显然，他在弗拉格斯塔夫找到了一条为自己的过去复仇的途径。我们放走了他，这样他就能理解自己的生活，找到内心的平静。}
### {234}{}{So are you going to pull him out of there?}
{234}{}{你打算把他从那里拉出来吗？}
### {235}{}{To injure one of our best shooters? There must be a really good reason for this.}
{235}{}{伤害我们最好的射手之一？这肯定有一个很好的理由。}
### {236}{}{I think you're right, General. You shouldn't pull him out of there until he wants to.}
{236}{}{我认为你是对的，将军。除非他愿意，否则你不应该把他从那里拉出来。}
### {237}{}{I don't believe my ears! Is that what the general says? That's it, I'm leaving here.}
{237}{}{我不相信我的耳朵！将军是这么说的吗？就这样，我要离开这里。}
### {238}{}{He takes revenge on everyone. His actions harm ordinary peaceful colonists.}
{238}{}{他对每个人都进行报复。他的行为伤害了普通的和平殖民者。}
### {239}{}{I don't care about his problems. Just get him out of there.}
{239}{}{我不在乎他的问题。把他弄出去。}
### {240}{}{That makes a difference. It looks like the situation has gone too far.}
{240}{}{这就不一样了。看起来情况已经太过分了。}
### {241}{}{You are a general. He will not disobey your order.}
{241}{}{你是将军。他不会违抗你的命令。}
### {242}{}{Most likely. Please give him the order to return to base if you find yourself in the vicinity. He adheres to radio silence and for some reason shuns the rest of the rangers.}
{242}{}{很有可能。如果你发现自己在附近，请命令他返回基地。他坚持无线电静默，出于某种原因避开了其他护林员。}
### {243}{}{There is!}
{243}{}{有！}
### {244}{}{Only if I'm nearby.}
{244}{}{只要我在附近。}

#Villa Union
### {250}{}{Times are hard in my native village. We need the Rangers' help.}
{250}{}{在我的家乡，日子不好过。我们需要游骑兵队的帮助。}
### {251}{}{Hard times... This can be said about almost any settlement in Arizona and California. But unlike ordinary inhabitants, we really have the opportunity to fight for the rights of people in the wastelands.}
{251}{}{艰难时期...亚利桑那州和加利福尼亚州的几乎所有定居点都可以这样说。但与普通居民不同的是，我们确实有机会为荒原上人们的权利而战。}
### {252}{}{[Next]}
{252}{}{[下一个]}
### {253}{}{Maintaining order requires serious investments in training rangers, equipping squads and patrols, intelligence and combat operations. Not everyone can invest in such an alliance, but we try to respond to everyone.}
{253}{}{维持秩序需要在训练护林员、装备小队和巡逻队、情报和作战行动方面进行大量投资。不是每个人都可以投资于这样一个联盟，但我们努力回应每个人。}
### {254}{}{I think it will not be a problem for the Villa to supply you with food and ceramics.}
{254}{}{我认为维拉为你提供食物和陶瓷不会成为问题。}
### {255}{}{You know, we really have nothing to offer. It looks like this union will be short-lived.}
{255}{}{你知道，我们真的没有什么可提供的。看来这个联盟将是短命的。}
### {256}{}{So you charge something for your protection?}
{256}{}{所以你收取保护费？}
### {257}{}{Of course. This is a kind of security tax - a normal practice in the Old World.}
{257}{}{当然这是一种安全税――在旧世界是正常的做法。}
### {258}{}{And if the population has nothing to pay tax with?}
{258}{}{如果人们没有什么可纳税的呢？}
### {259}{}{We are able to benefit from any cooperation. Some can build homes, others can grow crops, and some make good cadets. With the right approach, everyone can become useful to society.}
{259}{}{我们能够从任何合作中受益。有些人可以建造房屋，有些人可以种植作物，有些人是优秀的学员。有了正确的方法，每个人都可以对社会有用。}

### {260}{}{Villa... The Rangers have always respected your independence. But you've always stayed away from the rest of the world. When we needed food in the hungry years, you drove us away. Now you're asking for help. Tell me, who sent you to us?}
{260}{}{别墅...游骑兵队一直尊重你的独立性。但你总是远离世界其他地方。当我们在饥饿的年代需要食物时，你把我们赶走了。现在你在寻求帮助。告诉我，是谁派你来的？}
### {261}{}{The community council has decided that it is time to conclude an alliance with you.}
{261}{}{社区委员会决定是时候和你们结成联盟了。}
### {262}{}{Nobody. Many peasants were enslaved and taken to Flagstaff.}
{262}{}{没有人许多农民被奴役并被带到弗拉格斯塔夫。}
### {263}{}{Nobody. Many peasants were enslaved and taken to another city.}
{263}{}{没有人许多农民被奴役并被带到另一个城市。}
### {264}{}{I am here without the consent of the community.}
{264}{}{我是在未经社区同意的情况下来到这里的。}

### {270}{}{That's how... Well, an alliance with the Villa would be very useful, because now we need food more than ever. But I'm afraid the arrogance of your relatives will spoil the blood of our fighters.}
{270}{}{这就是为什么...和维拉结盟会非常有用，因为现在我们比以往任何时候都更需要食物。但我担心你们亲属的傲慢会破坏我们战士的鲜血。}
### {271}{}{It's hard to argue with this. And yet you are ready to help us?}
{271}{}{对此很难争辩。你准备好帮助我们了吗？}
### {272}{}{I don't care about your fighters. I'm only interested in saving the Villa.}
{272}{}{我不在乎你的战士。我只对拯救别墅感兴趣。}
### {273}{}{I'm afraid now is not the best time to do this. There are big problems on the southeastern front, we have thrown all our forces in that direction.}
{273}{}{恐怕现在不是这样做的最佳时机。东南战线上有很大的问题，我们已经把所有的力量都投向了这个方向。}
### {274}{}{Problems are my little hobby, General.}
{274}{}{将军，问题是我的小爱好。}
### {275}{}{Talk to Commander Helford. Perhaps he will allocate people to live in the Villa. And then we will discuss the terms of the union... if your community really wants it.}
{275}{}{和赫尔福德指挥官谈谈。也许他会派人住在别墅里。然后我们将讨论工会的条款...如果你的社区真的想要的话。}
### {276}{}{Thank you, General. I'll talk to Helford.}
{276}{}{谢谢你，将军。我会和赫尔福德谈谈。}
### {277}{}{Not yet. Keep in mind that you will have to be our right hand in negotiations with the peasants. Your task is to convince them of our friendliness and the need for an alliance.}
{277}{}{还没有。请记住，在与农民的谈判中，你必须是我们的得力助手。你的任务是让他们相信我们的友好和结盟的必要性。}
### {278}{}{No problems.}
{278}{}{没有问题。}
### {279}{}{You promised to help. So some residents of the Villa are still in slavery.}
{279}{}{你答应过要帮忙。所以别墅的一些居民仍然是奴隶。}

### {280}{}{Commander Helford has approved my request to protect the Villa.}
{280}{}{指挥官赫尔福德已经批准了我保护别墅的请求。}
### {281}{}{(nods his head significantly and ponders the answer for a while) Times are changing...}
{281}{}{（明显地点了点头，思考了一会儿答案）时代在变...}
### {282}{}{Eh, what?}
{282}{}{呃，什么？}
### {283}{}{[Listen]}
{283}{}{[听]}
### {284}{}{Previously, the residents of the Villa sought isolation and drove the rangers away. But times are changing. And you change with them, unwittingly. I think it's time to forget our past differences.}
{284}{}{此前，别墅的居民寻求隔离，并将护林员赶走。但时代在改变。而你却在不知不觉中随他们而变。我认为是时候忘记我们过去的分歧了。}
### {285}{}{So are you ready to make an alliance?}
{285}{}{你准备好结盟了吗？}
### {286}{}{I will give the order to Commander Helford to assemble a detachment to be quartered in your valley. Talk to him about the details. Keep in mind that you will have to be our right hand in negotiations with the peasants. When your community is ready, we will officially sign the union.}
{286}{}{我将命令赫尔福德指挥官组建一支分遣队驻扎在你的山谷里。和他谈谈细节。请记住，在与农民的谈判中，你必须是我们的得力助手。当你的社区准备好了，我们将正式签署工会。}
### {287}{}{Thank you, General.}
{287}{}{谢谢你，将军。}
### {288}{}{Unfortunately, several of our people are still being held as slaves in another city.}
{288}{}{不幸的是，我们的一些人仍然被关押在另一个城市作为奴隶。}
### {289}{}{Are you talking about the Flagstaff mines? We know this situation and have been trying to solve it for a long time. Well, I think we'll be able to buy some of your people out of the slave stall. Your compa?eros tribales will be coming home soon.}
{289}{}{你说的是弗拉格斯塔夫矿吗？我们知道这种情况，并一直在努力解决它很长一段时间。好吧，我想我们可以从奴隶摊上买下你们的一些人。你的同伴部落很快就会回家。}
### {290}{}{How do you know so much about us?}
{290}{}{你怎么知道我们这么多？}
### {291}{}{We collect information about any settlements in the wastelands. It's part of our job. Besides, the leader of your community has already visited us once... What was his name? Adolf... no, Andres Tejada.}
{291}{}{我们收集荒地上任何定居点的信息。这是我们工作的一部分。此外，你们社区的领导已经来过我们一次了...他叫什么名字？阿道夫...不，安德烈斯・特贾达。}
### {292}{}{That's my father! I didn't know that he had left the community so far away.}
{292}{}{那是我爸爸！我不知道他离开了这么远的社区。}
### {1292}{}{That's my father! I didn't know that he had left the community so far away.}
{1292}{}{那是我爸爸！我不知道他离开了这么远的社区。}
### {293}{}{Yes. But those negotiations, unfortunately, did not lead to anything.}
{293}{}{对但不幸的是，这些谈判没有取得任何成果。}

### {294}{}{The villa is ready to make an alliance with you.}
{294}{}{别墅已经准备好和你结盟了。}
### {295}{}{Very good. From this day on, I declare our union complete. Go back to the Villa and celebrate this day with the whole community.}
{295}{}{很好。从今天起，我宣布我们的联盟结束。回到别墅，与整个社区一起庆祝这一天。}

{296}{}{好啊}
### {297}{}{Finish the mission first. Then we'll talk.}
{297}{}{先完成任务。然后我们再谈。}
### {298}{}{OK.}

# Jackals
### {300}{}{Let's talk about Jackals.}
{300}{}{让我们谈谈豺狼。}
### {301}{}{Jackals are one of the sick calluses on the body of this earth. What exactly did you want to discuss?}
{301}{}{豺狼是地球上病态的老茧之一。你到底想讨论什么？}
### {302}{}{I know the location of their main base. And I managed to examine it from the inside.}
{302}{}{我知道他们主要基地的位置。我设法从里面检查了一下。}
### {303}{}{A very dubious and at the same time intriguing statement. No one has ever managed to find this place and, moreover, get out of there alive.}
{303}{}{这是一个非常可疑的同时又很有趣的说法。从来没有人找到这个地方，而且还活着离开那里。}
### {304}{}{What about the rescued ranger?}
{304}{}{获救的护林员呢？}
### {305}{}{So this is your merit? Well, Ranger Jackson was let down by inexperience - on the way back he got lost and wandered through the desert for a long time until he found one of our abandoned outposts. We never found out the exact coordinates, and combing a whole dangerous area in search of burrows was too big a task.}
{305}{}{这就是你的优点？流浪者杰克逊因缺乏经验而失望――在回来的路上，他迷路了，在沙漠中徘徊了很长一段时间，直到他找到了我们一个废弃的前哨基地。我们从来没有找到确切的坐标，在整个危险区域搜寻洞穴的任务太大了。}
### {306}{}{It turns out that even a ranger is primarily concerned with survival...}
{306}{}{事实证明，即使是护林员也主要关心生存...}
### {307}{}{Trust me. I am the only source of information for you.}
{307}{}{相信我，我是你唯一的信息来源。}
### {308}{}{So, where is this base?}
{308}{}{那么，这个基地在哪里？}
### {309}{}{On the border of the Mojave and Sonora deserts, north of the Villa.}
{309}{}{在莫哈韦沙漠和索诺拉沙漠的边界上，别墅以北。}
### {310}{}{I need to check the maps. Wait a bit.}
{310}{}{我需要查一下地图。等一下。}
### {311}{}{Yes, it seems to be true. I think we should do some scouting there. And after finding the base... destroy it.}
{311}{}{是的，这似乎是真的。我认为我们应该在那里做一些侦察。找到基地后...摧毁它。}
### {312}{}{Great plan. These jackals don't deserve their place in the sun. Destroy them all!}
{312}{}{伟大的计划。这些豺狼不配在阳光下占有一席之地。毁灭他们！}
### {313}{}{Good. A guide will be useful to us in this operation. Participation will allow you to collect trophies. Agree to help?}
{313}{}{好的在这次行动中，导游对我们很有用。参与将允许您收集奖杯。同意帮忙吗？}
### {1313}{}{OK. A guide will be useful to us in this operation. Participation will allow you to collect trophies. Do you agree to help?}
{1313}{}{好的。在这次行动中，导游对我们很有用。参与将允许您收集奖杯。你同意帮忙吗？}
### {314}{}{Yes.}
{314}{}{对}
### {315}{}{No.}
{315}{}{不}
### {316}{}{That is, I have to... kill?}
{316}{}{也就是说，我必须…杀人？}
### {317}{}{I like your attitude. In the location you indicated, a squad of punishers will be waiting. Go there immediately.}
{317}{}{我喜欢你的态度。在你指定的地点，一队惩罚者将在等待。马上去那里。}
### {1317}{}{I like your attitude. In the location you indicated, a squad of punishers will be waiting. Go there immediately.}
{1317}{}{我喜欢你的态度。在你指定的地点，一队惩罚者将在等待。马上去那里。}
### {318}{}{The journey is not easy. Is there any way to make it easier for me?}
{318}{}{旅途并不容易。有什么办法让我更轻松吗？}
### {319}{}{It will be done, General!}
{319}{}{一定会成功的，将军！}
### {320}{}{Contact the patrolmen. They'll take you into the squad.}
{320}{}{联系巡警。他们会带你进入球队。}
### {321}{}{It's sad to hear that. Well, as usual, we'll do everything ourselves. Thank you for the information, you can go.}
{321}{}{听到这个消息很难过。和往常一样，我们什么都自己做。谢谢你提供的信息，你可以走了。}
### {322}{}{I've changed my mind! Let me participate in the siege.}
{322}{}{我改变主意了！让我参与围攻吧。}
### {323}{}{Goodbye.}
{323}{}{再见}
### {324}{}{You can just stand and watch... Watch as your saviors and protectors are killed. Or you can take up arms and help them with something. So do you agree?}
{324}{}{你可以站着看着...看着你的救世主和保护者被杀害。或者你可以拿起武器帮他们做点什么。你同意吗？}
### {1324}{}{You can just stand and watch... Watch as your saviors and protectors are killed. Or you can take up arms and help them with something. So do you agree?}
{1324}{}{你可以站着看着...看着你的救世主和保护者被杀害。或者你可以拿起武器帮他们做点什么。你同意吗？}
### {325}{}{Well, you know better what to do next.}
{325}{}{好吧，你更清楚下一步该做什么。}
### {326}{}{OK. Then we'll manage on our own. Thank you for the information.}
{326}{}{好的。那我们自己来处理。谢谢你提供的信息。}
### {327}{}{Glad to try.}
{327}{}{很高兴尝试。}
### {1327}{}{I'm glad to try.}
{1327}{}{我很乐意尝试。}

### {330}{}{Don't be in such a hurry. Jackals are ready to form an alliance with outsiders if it solves their hunger problem.}
{330}{}{别这么着急。如果能解决他们的饥饿问题，豺狼准备与外界结成联盟。}
### {331}{}{What nonsense is this? These savages have already drunk so much blood from the Rangers and the surrounding settlements that negotiations are out of the question!}
{331}{}{这是什么胡说八道？这些野蛮人已经从游骑兵队和周围的定居点喝了很多血，谈判是不可能的！}
### {332}{}{I think it's worth trying to negotiate with them. They lead such an aggressive lifestyle only because of widespread hunger.}
{332}{}{我认为与他们谈判是值得的。他们过着如此激进的生活方式，只是因为普遍的饥饿。}
### {333}{}{Hmm. Then, if it's not too much trouble for you, explain to me what is the advantage of an alliance with cannibal savages?}
{333}{}{嗯。那么，如果这对你来说不是太麻烦的话，向我解释一下与食人野蛮人结盟的好处是什么？}
### {334}{}{They are disorganized and scattered all over the wasteland. By destroying the main base, you will only anger the remaining clans. This feud will last for generations.}
{334}{}{它们杂乱无章，散落在荒地上。通过摧毁主要基地，你只会激怒剩下的部族。这种世仇将延续几代人。}
### {335}{}{The thought of a war with savages is not so much frightening as annoying. Well, we'll try diplomacy. Perhaps this approach will unite and calm the Jackal clans. Thanks for the information. You can go now.}
{335}{}{一想到与野蛮人开战，与其说是可怕，不如说是令人讨厌。好吧，我们将尝试外交手段。也许这种方法可以团结和平息豺狼家族。谢谢你提供的信息。你现在可以走了。}
### {336}{}{Glad to try, General. I will return to the Jackals and tell them about the upcoming negotiations.}
{336}{}{很高兴尝试，将军。我将回到豺狼队，告诉他们即将进行的谈判。}
### {1336}{}{Glad to try, General. I will return to the Jackals and tell them about the upcoming negotiations.}
{1336}{}{很高兴尝试，将军。我将回到豺狼队，告诉他们即将进行的谈判。}
### {337}{}{Indeed, the last time they tried to kill me and devour me. I don't think I'll be able to negotiate with them again.}
{337}{}{事实上，上一次他们试图杀死我并吞噬我。我想我再也无法与他们谈判了。}
### {338}{}{Nothing. These jackals don't deserve their place in the sun. Destroy them all!}
{338}{}{没有什么这些豺狼不配在阳光下占有一席之地。毁灭他们！}

### {340}{}{I want to report Ranger Garth's crimes.}
{340}{}{我想报告流浪者加思的罪行。}
### {341}{}{A ranger in an Aqueduct? We placed him there to establish order. What crimes did he commit?}
{341}{}{渡槽里的护林员？我们把他安置在那里是为了维持秩序。他犯了什么罪？}
### {342}{}{Numerous murders of refugees on the grounds of distrust of outsiders. He dumped their bodies into the aqueduct shafts.}
{342}{}{多次以不信任外来者为由谋杀难民。他把他们的尸体倒进了输水渠。}
### {343}{}{Can you show them? In this case, we have a big trial ahead of us. We'll take Garth into custody. Thanks for the information... although this news crushes me. Especially in such a difficult time.}
{343}{}{你能给他们看吗？在这种情况下，我们将面临一场重大的审判。我们将拘留加思。谢谢你提供的信息...尽管这个消息让我很伤心，尤其是在这样一个困难的时刻。}
### {344}{}{Yes, I understand... Goodbye, General.}
{344}{}{是的，我理解...再见，将军。}

#Ranger Title
### {350}{}{I want to join the ranks of the Rangers.}
{350}{}{我想加入游骑兵队。}
### {351}{}{Commendable zeal. But the title of ranger must be earned. Many cadets have been training and participating in missions for years to get a badge. What merits can you name?}
{351}{}{值得称赞的热情。但是护林员的头衔是必须得来的。许多学员多年来一直在训练和参加任务，以获得徽章。你能说出什么优点？}
### {352}{}{I don't seem to have anything to answer that.}
{352}{}{我似乎没有什么要回答的。}
### {353}{}{That's what I thought. Join the cadet corps and serve for several years for the benefit of our mission.}
{353}{}{我就是这么想的。加入学员团，为我们的使命服务几年。}
### {354}{}{I'll think about it.}
{354}{}{我会考虑的。}
### {355}{}{Let me take a little more of your time, General.}
{355}{}{将军，让我多花点时间。}
### {356}{}{Is there a faster way?}
{356}{}{有更快的路吗？}
### {357}{}{Hmm. Talk to Commander Helford, he's been looking for recruits for special assignments for a long time.}
{357}{}{嗯。和赫尔福德指挥官谈谈，他已经为特殊任务寻找新兵很长时间了。}
### {358}{}{I'll think about it.}
{358}{}{我会考虑的。}
### {359}{}{Yes, this is a serious statement. But it is not enough for the rank of ranger.}
{359}{}{是的，这是一个严肃的声明。但这对于护林员的级别来说是不够的。}
### {360}{}{I destroyed a tribe of Jackals.}
{360}{}{我摧毁了一个豺狼部落。}
### {1360}{}{I destroyed a tribe of Jackals.}
{1360}{}{我摧毁了一个豺狼部落。}
### {361}{}{With my help, you have made an alliance with the Jackals.}
{361}{}{在我的帮助下，你和豺狼联盟了。}
### {362}{}{Thanks to me, the slave trade in Flagstaff was eliminated.}
{362}{}{多亏了我，弗拉格斯塔夫的奴隶贸易被消除了。}
### {363}{}{I freed the slaves in Flagstaff.}
{363}{}{我解放了弗拉格斯塔夫的奴隶。}

{410}{}{你是如何成为一名护林员的？}
### {411}{}{I passed all the milestones of ranger development and honestly rose to the rank of general.}

### {412}{}{You must have traveled a lot?}
{412}{}{你一定经常旅行？}
### {413}{}{Oh yes, I've been to different parts of the Southwest, including Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Phoenix. The same problems are everywhere - hunger, devastation and desertification.}
{413}{}{哦，是的，我去过西南部的不同地方，包括洛杉矶、拉斯维加斯和凤凰城。同样的问题无处不在――饥饿、破坏和荒漠化。}
### {420}{}{Can you tell us about this place?}
{420}{}{你能告诉我们这个地方的情况吗？}
### {421}{}{This is the main base of the rangers in Arizona. The power plant serves us as a citadel, and the dam as a fortress. Outside, as you already know, there is an information center and a training ground.}
{421}{}{这是亚利桑那州护林员的主要基地。发电厂是我们的堡垒，大坝是我们的要塞。正如你所知，外面有一个信息中心和一个训练场。}
### {422}{}{So there are other bases?}
{422}{}{那么还有其他基地吗？}
### {423}{}{That's right. There are several large forts like this one in Nevada and California. We keep in touch with them, but each has its own rules and principles.}
{423}{}{没错。在内华达州和加利福尼亚州有几个像这样的大堡垒。我们与他们保持联系，但每个人都有自己的规则和原则。}
### {424}{}{What is the mission of the Rangers?}
{424}{}{游骑兵队的任务是什么？}
### {425}{}{We bring Law and Order to this chaotic world. To begin with, this means protecting settlements and caravan routes from bandits and mutants. But protection is only the first frontier.}
{425}{}{我们把法律和秩序带到这个混乱的世界。首先，这意味着保护定居点和商队路线免受土匪和变种人的袭击。但保护只是第一道防线。}
### {426}{}{[Next]}
{426}{}{[下一个]}
### {427}{}{The residents who have joined us are obliged to adopt the Law, pay taxes and do useful work. Such as growing crops or hunting game.}
{427}{}{加入我们的居民有义务通过法律，纳税并做有益的工作。如种植庄稼或狩猎。}
### {428}{}{Why did you dam the waters of Colorado?}
{428}{}{你为什么要在科罗拉多州筑坝？}
### {429}{}{(sighs mockingly) This dam has been standing here for a long time. It uses water pressure to generate electricity... I hope you know what it is. We have only restored the work of the dam and turned it into a fort for protection from enemies and bad weather.}
{429}{}{（嘲讽地叹了口气）这座大坝已经在这里矗立了很长时间。它利用水压发电...我希望你知道它是什么。我们只是修复了大坝，把它变成了防御敌人和恶劣天气的堡垒。}
### {430}{}{But you have taken the only place to cross the Colorado for miles around.}
{430}{}{但你已经走了唯一一个穿越科罗拉多河数英里的地方。}
### {431}{}{Roadblocks allow you to save the dam and the power plant from stupid commoners. This is a unique equipment, it is critically important for us and for the surrounding lands. And to cross the river there is a ferry downstream with very reasonable prices.}
{431}{}{路障可以让你从愚蠢的平民手中拯救大坝和发电厂。这是一种独特的设备，对我们和周围的土地都至关重要。要过江，下游有一艘价格非常合理的渡船。}
### {432}{}{What Law were you talking about, General?}
{432}{}{将军，你在说什么法律？}
### {433}{}{Simple truths for any prosperous society. Don't kill unless absolutely necessary. Don't take someone else's without asking. Act for the good of your community. There is a set of similar rules. But unfortunately, many in the Wastelands do not know how to read, so we have to explain in a simpler and more intelligible language.}
{433}{}{任何繁荣社会的简单真理。除非绝对必要，否则不要杀人。不要不请自来地拿走别人的。为社区的利益而行动。有一套类似的规则。但不幸的是，荒原上的许多人不知道如何阅读，所以我们不得不用更简单易懂的语言进行解释。}
### {434}{}{Human relations are much more important than any laws.}
{434}{}{人际关系比任何法律都重要。}
### {435}{}{(tired sigh) As they used to say in the Old World, the law is harsh, but it's the law. People couldn't think of anything better for self-organization and discipline. Rejection of the Law leads to chaos. And we have learned this well over the last hundred years.}
{435}{}{（疲惫的叹息）正如旧世界人们常说的那样，法律是严厉的，但这就是法律。人们想不出比这更好的自组织和纪律了。拒绝法律会导致混乱。在过去的一百年里，我们已经很好地了解了这一点。}
### {436}{}{You mentioned the Old World. But it has been in ruins for a long time.}
{436}{}{你提到了旧世界。但它已经成为废墟很长一段时间了。}
### {437}{}{Right. The nuclear Apocalypse was the fruit of pride and stupidity. Now we're paying for it. But everyone makes mistakes. The only question is what conclusions we will draw from them.}
{437}{}{正确的核启示录是骄傲和愚蠢的结晶。现在我们正在为此付出代价。但每个人都会犯错。唯一的问题是我们将从中得出什么结论。}
### {438}{}{I just want to let you know that the case has moved forward. It remains to negotiate with the leader. I'll do it very soon.}

{455}{}{嗯，嗯。非常好奇。我们已经监控这个数据库很长时间了，我们知道大教堂在某种程度上与之有关。这份秘密报告稍微澄清了情况...我不明白你为什么要给我们？}

### {461}{}{What are you talking about?}
{461}{}{你在说什么？}
### {462}{}{The tragedy has only affected your small peaceful commune. The real threat bottlecaps all of Southern Arizona. Already now the rangers are trying to recapture the town of San Brahmin from the invaders.}
{462}{}{这场悲剧只影响了你们这个和平的小社区。真正的威胁笼罩着整个亚利桑那州南部。现在，护林员正试图从入侵者手中夺回圣婆罗门镇。}
### {463}{}{But we weren't going to get involved in a war.}
{463}{}{但我们不会卷入战争。}
### {464}{}{No matter how hard you try to stay isolated from the rest of the world, this world ALREADY knows about the Villa. And if San Brahmin falls, your peaceful community may be next.}
{464}{}{无论你多么努力地与世界隔绝，这个世界已经知道别墅了。如果圣婆罗门沦陷，你的和平社区可能是下一个。}
### {465}{}{Damn, something has to be done about it.}
{465}{}{该死，必须要做点什么。}
### {466}{}{I have to ask you for one simple favor while we're busy with the Villa. Take my instructions to Agent Oscar in San Brahmin. He helps the local resistance forces. Consider it part of our union.}
{466}{}{在我们忙于别墅的时候，我得请你帮个简单的忙。把我的指示交给圣婆罗门的奥斯卡探员。他帮助当地的抵抗力量。把它看作我们联盟的一部分。}
### {467}{}{The work seems to be simple. Permission to go, General?}
{467}{}{这项工作似乎很简单。允许去吗，将军？}
### {468}{}{It looks like I'll have to deal with this issue before the threat gets to the Villa. See you, General.}

### {473}{}{That's right, General.}
{473}{}{没错，将军。}
### {474}{}{[CHEAT: It's done!]}
{474}{}{[谢：完了！]}
### {475}{}{The missionaries left San Brahmin. This is good news. But we must not forget that they can return. It was a great moment to form an alliance with the tribal leader. Now the moment is lost.}
{475}{}{传教士离开了圣婆罗门。这是个好消息。但我们决不能忘记，他们可以回来。这是一个与部落首领结盟的伟大时刻。现在时机已失。}
### {476}{}{[Next]}
{476}{}{[下一个]}
### {477}{}{Hmm-m. That's what I was most afraid of. A detachment of missionaries in San Brahmin acted on orders from Phoenix. Apparently, Aaron's dreams of empire were not far from reality.}
{477}{}{嗯。这就是我最害怕的。圣婆罗门的一支传教士分遣队遵照凤凰城的命令行动。显然，亚伦的帝国梦离现实并不遥远。}
### {478}{}{How do we stop this Phoenix Lord?}
{478}{}{我们该如何阻止这位凤凰领主？}
### {479}{}{It won't be easy. But I am aware of a group of rebels in Phoenix who are also fighting against Aaron and his church. Try to contact them and offer our help. I'm asking you because it's hard for rangers to work in a crowded urban environment.}
{479}{}{这并不容易。但我知道凤凰城有一群反叛分子，他们也在与亚伦和他的教会作战。试着联系他们并提供我们的帮助。我问你是因为护林员很难在拥挤的城市环境中工作。}
### {480}{}{Can I learn more about the purpose of my mission?}
{480}{}{我能了解更多关于我使命的目的吗？}
### {481}{}{We had to get involved in several local conflicts to prevent the spread of the "red contagion" from Phoenix. The situation is difficult and requires a speedy resolution.}
{481}{}{为了防止“红色传染病”从凤凰城蔓延，我们不得不卷入几场地方冲突。局势困难，需要迅速解决。}
### {482}{}{[Next]}
{482}{}{[下一个]}
### {483}{}{Go to San Brahmin and find Ranger Oscar there. He oversees the locals to fight the invaders. Take the report to him and, if necessary, assist in resolving the conflict.}

{504}{}{据我所知，他们隐藏在地下通信中，进行加密无线电传输。你也可以询问周围的人，当地人中肯定会有他们的支持者。但要小心提问。}
### {505}{}{Thank you, it may help.}
{505}{}{谢谢，这可能会有所帮助。}
### {506}{}{Why is it so important to get rid of Aaron and his church?}
{506}{}{为什么除掉亚伦和他的教会如此重要？}
### {507}{}{The cult is just a puppet in the hands of Aaron, the local ruler. He seeks to create an empire, therefore he conducts an aggressive policy and physically exterminates dissent.}

{520}{}{[下一个]}
### {521}{}{Without its ruler, the city will fall victim to discord. The governors of Aaron will begin to fight among themselves for the throne, the peaceful population will "remember" the old grievances of the church, and the rebels will be able to act more openly and decisively. It will be a difficult period for the city, but I believe it's for the best.}
{521}{}{如果没有统治者，这座城市将成为不和的牺牲品。亚伦的总督们将开始为王位而战，和平的民众将“记住”教会的旧怨，叛军将能够更加公开和果断地采取行动。对这座城市来说，这将是一个艰难的时期，但我相信这是最好的。}

{555}{}{在两条战线上，保持忠诚是不可能的。冲突是不可避免的。如果你选择一个按照自己意愿征服亚利桑那州南部的殖民者，那么你在护林员中就没有立足之地。}
### {556}{}{There has always been a gap between religion and law. In such a situation, it is impossible to maintain understanding, conflict is inevitable. If you choose the path of a sectarian, then you have no place among the rangers.}
{556}{}{宗教和法律之间一直存在着隔阂。在这样的情况下，不可能保持理解，冲突是不可避免的。如果你选择了一条宗派主义的道路，那么你在护林员中就没有立足之地。}
### {557}{}{Obviously, your actions differ from the principles of Law and Order. You may be misinterpreting them, but this does not deprive you of responsibility. We can't have a man like you wearing a ranger badge.}
{557}{}{显然，你的行为与法律和秩序的原则不同。你可能误解了它们，但这并不能剥夺你的责任。我们不能让像你这样的人戴着护林员徽章。}

### {559}{}{Go in peace. Out of respect for your past achievements, we are only depriving you of your rank. Under other circumstances, the penalty for betrayal would be execution.}
{559}{}{平静地去吧。出于对你过去成就的尊重，我们只是剥夺了你的军衔。在其他情况下，背叛的惩罚将是处决。}
### {560}{}{I understand, General. You won't hear from me again.}
{560}{}{我理解，将军。你不会再收到我的消息了。}
### {561}{}{Learn to forgive, General. You'll need it someday.}
{561}{}{学会原谅，将军。总有一天你会需要它的。}
### {562}{}{We know what you're doing here. Go away. A sentry will escort you outside.}
{562}{}{我们知道你在这里做什么。走开。哨兵会护送你出去。}
### {563}{}{[Leave the room]}
{563}{}{[离开房间]}

### {570}{}{A very unexpected visit. I thought your church hated our brother.}
{570}{}{一次非常意外的访问。我还以为你们教会恨我们的兄弟。}
### {571}{}{Can't we live in peace?}
{571}{}{我们不能和平生活吗？}
### {572}{}{Only if we put barricades with a moat of radioactive liquid on the border.}
{572}{}{只要我们在边境设置带有放射性液体护城河的路障。}
### {573}{}{[Next]}
{573}{}{[下一个]}
### {574}{}{Your church imposes its perverted dogmas on others and punishes those who disagree with them. Your leader creates an empire under the flag of the church and develops slavery. We have nothing to negotiate with the snake. Go and tell this to your prior. This concludes our negotiations.}
{574}{}{你的教会将其变态的教条强加给他人，并惩罚那些不同意它们的人。你的领袖在教会的旗帜下建立了一个帝国，并发展了奴隶制。我们没有什么可与蛇谈判的。去告诉你的前任。我们的谈判到此结束。}
### {575}{}{[Leave the room]}
{575}{}{[离开房间]}
### {576}{}{So, here is a goodwill ambassador from the Brotherhood of Steel itself. Are you going to hand over the armistice agreement to us? Or maybe it's a demand for surrender?}
{576}{}{因此，这里有一位来自钢铁兄弟会本身的亲善大使。你打算把停战协议交给我们吗？或者可能是要求投降？}
### {577}{}{I don't know what you're talking about. I'm here of my own free will.}
{577}{}{我不知道你在说什么。我是自愿来的。}
### {578}{}{Perhaps. Anyway, we can't let you be in our database. The sentry will show the exit to the outside.}
{578}{}{可能无论如何，我们不能让你进入我们的数据库。哨兵将向外面指示出口。}
### {579}{}{[Leave the room]}
{579}{}{[离开房间]}
### {580}{}{If you fail to reach an agreement with the Brotherhood, it will wipe your dam off the face of the earth.}
{580}{}{如果你不能与兄弟会达成协议，它将把你的堤坝从地球上抹去。}
### {581}{}{These threats only prove the hostility of the Brotherhood of Steel. Military services are created for war, not for the creation of a new world. Your Brotherhood should learn to live in peace. Now go and tell this to your general. This concludes our negotiations.}
{581}{}{这些威胁只能证明钢铁兄弟会的敌意。军事服务是为战争而建立的，而不是为了创造一个新世界。你的兄弟会应该学会和平生活。现在去告诉你的将军。我们的谈判到此结束。}

### {595}{}{But this is not the end. As we expected, Aaron was just part of a big game. Tinsmiths helped him with weapons and equipment for the sake of cheap uranium.}
{595}{}{但这还没有结束。正如我们所料，亚伦只是一场重要比赛的一部分。为了廉价的铀，锡匠帮他提供武器和设备。}
### {596}{}{[Next]}
{596}{}{[下一个]}
### {597}{}{However, it's even more interesting - a certain third party was in the contract. Otherwise, Aaron and the tinsmiths would not have been able to agree on cooperation, and Aaron himself would never have come to power.}
{597}{}{然而，更有趣的是，合同中有一个特定的第三方。否则，亚伦和锡匠们就无法就合作达成一致，亚伦本人也永远不会掌权。}
### {598}{}{[Next]}
{598}{}{[下一个]}
### {599}{}{We know almost nothing about this mysterious organization. It is based in the old port of Puerto Penasco and conducts an aggressive military policy.}
{599}{}{我们对这个神秘的组织几乎一无所知。它的基地设在老港口佩纳斯科港，实行侵略性的军事政策。}
### {600}{}{[Next]}
{600}{}{[下一个]}
### {601}{}{We know for sure that the uranium ore from Flagstaff is transported to the tinsmiths, and the finished batteries from the uranium chips are exported mainly to the outpost in Puerto.}
{601}{}{我们确信，弗拉格斯塔夫的铀矿被运往锡匠厂，铀芯片的成品电池主要出口到波多黎各的前哨基地。}
### {602}{}{[Next]}
{602}{}{[下一个]}
### {603}{}{In other words, this organization decided to subjugate Southern Arizona in order to obtain resources with cheap labor. They put their vassals in charge of the settlements, as was the case with Casa Grande. They start revolutions, as it was in San Brahmin. They seize resources and use slaves for this. And we don't even know who we're dealing with.}
{603}{}{换句话说，这个组织决定征服亚利桑那州南部，以获得廉价劳动力的资源。他们让他们的附庸负责定居点，就像格兰德之家的情况一样。他们发动革命，就像在圣婆罗门一样。他们攫取资源，并为此使用奴隶。我们甚至不知道我们在和谁打交道。}
### {604}{}{[Next]}
{604}{}{[下一个]}
### {605}{}{, now you understand that your Villa just got "under fire". If this army continues to enslave Southern Arizona, then Villa, like all other small settlements, will lose its freedom. The best way to avoid this is to ally with the Rangers and present a united front against the invader.}
{605}{}{，现在你明白了你的别墅刚刚“受到了攻击”。如果这支军队继续奴役亚利桑那州南部，那么维拉和其他所有小定居点一样，将失去自由。避免这种情况的最好方法是与游骑兵队结盟，建立一个对抗入侵者的统一战线。}
### {606}{}{What is required of me now?}
{606}{}{现在需要我做什么？}
### {607}{}{Go to Puerto Penasco and find the weak points of the enemy. Our scouts have not been able to find out any valuable information yet - this military base is too far away and too well organized.}
{607}{}{前往佩纳斯科港，找出敌人的弱点。我们的侦察兵还没能找到任何有价值的信息――这个军事基地太远了，组织得太好了。}
### {608}{}{Then how do I do it?}
{608}{}{那我该怎么做呢？}
### {609}{}{You're a peasant. You'll be less suspicious. Besides, you have a good reason - the enslavement of the Villa. Good luck.}
{609}{}{你是个农民。你就不会那么多疑了。此外，你有一个很好的理由-奴役别墅。祝你好运}
### {1609}{}{You're a peasant. You'll be less suspicious. Besides, you have a good reason - the enslavement of the Villa. Good luck.}
{1609}{}{你是个农民。你就不会那么多疑了。此外，你有一个很好的理由-奴役别墅。祝你好运}
### {610}{}{Let me go, General.}
{610}{}{让我走吧，将军。}
### {611}{}{In my opinion, this is suicide. I wash my hands of it, General.}
{611}{}{在我看来，这是自杀。我洗手不干，将军。}
### {612}{}{Think about everything that has been said here. Perhaps it is your support that will not be enough to win this war.}
{612}{}{想想这里所说的一切。也许你的支持不足以赢得这场战争。}
### {613}{}{You're right, General. I will try to find out more about this mysterious organization.}
{613}{}{你说得对，将军。我会努力了解更多关于这个神秘组织的信息。}
### {614}{}{Look for fools. And I'm going home, my native Villa is waiting for me, General.}
{614}{}{寻找傻瓜。我要回家了，我的家乡维拉在等我，将军。}

### {620}{}{I managed to infiltrate the Brotherhood of Steel base.}
{620}{}{我设法潜入了钢铁兄弟会基地。}
### {621}{}{Good news. What did you find out? What are their weaknesses?}
{621}{}{好消息。你发现了什么？他们的弱点是什么？}
### {622}{}{I don't know their weaknesses yet. They are too well organized and protected.}
{622}{}{我还不知道他们的弱点。他们的组织和保护得太好了。}
### {623}{}{Sorry to hear that. But I believe that you will succeed. Keep scouting.}
{623}{}{很抱歉听到这个消息。但我相信你会成功的。继续侦察。}
### {624}{}{Let me go, General.}
{624}{}{让我走吧，将军。}
### {625}{}{May I take another minute of your time?}
{625}{}{我可以再占用你一分钟时间吗？}
### {626}{}{Their ship is full of explosives. But I don't know how to approach it yet.}
{626}{}{他们的船上装满了炸药。但我还不知道该怎么做。}
### {627}{}{Great idea. If you find a way to blow up their entire ship, it will erase the Brotherhood from the map of Arizona. Their vassals and small outposts will remain helpless. Try to do it. I believe you will succeed.}
{627}{}{好主意。如果你想办法炸毁他们的整艘船，这将把兄弟会从亚利桑那州的地图上抹去。他们的附庸和小前哨将继续孤立无援。试着去做吧。我相信你会成功的。}
### {628}{}{You know, I was released only because I was offered a similar task.}
{628}{}{你知道，我被释放只是因为我得到了类似的任务。}
### {629}{}{That's how... And what did you decide? Whose side are you on?}

{1629}{}{这就是为什么...你做了什么决定？你站在谁一边？}
### {630}{}{Of course, on yours, General.}
{630}{}{当然是你的，将军。}
### {631}{}{Then do me a favor - use the trust you have gained to destroy our common enemy.}
{631}{}{那帮我一个忙――利用你获得的信任来摧毁我们共同的敌人。}
### {632}{}{Permission to go, General?}
{632}{}{允许去吗，将军？}
### {633}{}{You can't handle them, General. Admit defeat.}
{633}{}{你对付不了他们，将军。承认失败}
### {634}{}{Admit defeat because of one message? It's a pity that everything turned out this way. Now I can't let you go until we get all the answers. It was not worth going against the Rangers.}
{634}{}{因为一条信息而承认失败？很遗憾，一切都变成这样了。现在，在我们得到所有答案之前，我不能让你走。与游骑兵队比赛是不值得的。}
### {635}{}{No, General. I'll get out of here. And no one will touch me.}
{635}{}{不，将军。我要离开这里。没有人会碰我。}
### {636}{}{We are no longer allies. So fuck off, old man. You can't intimidate me.}
{636}{}{我们不再是盟友。滚吧，老家伙。你不能恐吓我。}
### {637}{}{I managed to infiltrate the Brotherhood ship and detonate the torpedoes. The base is completely destroyed.}
{637}{}{我设法潜入兄弟会的飞船并引爆了鱼雷。基地完全被毁。}
### {638}{}{There has never been such good news in many years! Having driven out the Brotherhood, we have preserved our native lands for ourselves and our descendants. What could be better?}
{638}{}{多年来从未有过这样的好消息！在驱逐了兄弟会之后，我们为自己和我们的后代保留了我们的祖国。还有什么更好的呢？}
### {639}{}{Of course.}
{639}{}{当然}
### {640}{}{We still have a lot to do to eradicate the remnants of the evil sown by the Brotherhood. Your mission is over. I suggest you become a ranger and serve in your native Villa.}
{640}{}{我们仍有许多工作要做，以铲除兄弟会播下的邪恶残余。你的任务结束了。我建议你成为一名护林员，在你的家乡别墅服役。}
### {641}{}{Thank you, General. But I want to preserve my freedom and the freedom of my village.}
{641}{}{谢谢你，将军。但我想维护我的自由和我所在村庄的自由。}
### {642}{}{Well, then go to your family at the Villa and tell the good news.}
{642}{}{好吧，那就去你别墅的家人那里，告诉他们这个好消息。}
### {643}{}{Glad to have served, General.}
{643}{}{很高兴能服役，将军。}
### {1643}{}{It was a pleasure to serve, General.}
{1643}{}{很高兴为您服务，将军。}
### {644}{}{Thank you for the honor of becoming a ranger.}
{644}{}{感谢你有幸成为一名护林员。}
### {645}{}{From now on, you're one of the Rangers. Keep Law and Order in your native land. Now go back to the Villa and tell your family the good news.}
{645}{}{从现在起，你就是游骑兵队的一员。在你的祖国保持法律和秩序。现在回到别墅，告诉你的家人这个好消息。}
### {1645}{}{From now on, you're one of the Rangers. Keep Law and Order in your native land. Now go back to the Villa and tell your family the good news.}
{1645}{}{从现在起，你就是游骑兵队的一员。在你的祖国保持法律和秩序。现在回到别墅，告诉你的家人这个好消息。}

{647}{}{我们仍有许多工作要做，以铲除兄弟会播下的邪恶残余。你的任务结束了。回到别墅，告诉你的家人这个好消息。}
### {648}{}{Why not just attack this fort with a whole squad of rangers?}
{648}{}{为什么不带着一整队护林员去攻击这座堡垒呢？}
### {649}{}{Our opponent is strong and well organized. In an open fight against him, we have no chance. In such a case, we say: if you want to defeat a strong beast, cut his legs and finish him off from afar.}
{649}{}{我们的对手很强壮，组织得很好。与他公开对抗，我们没有机会。在这种情况下，我们说：如果你想打败一只强壮的野兽，就砍下他的腿，从远处把他干掉。}
### {650}{}{I want to talk about our new enemy.}
{650}{}{我想谈谈我们的新敌人。}
### {651}{}{Sure. Did you find out anything?}
{651}{}{当然你发现什么了吗？}
### {652}{}{Absolutely not.}
{652}{}{绝对不是。}
### {653}{}{What do you know about the base in Puerto?}
{653}{}{你对波多黎各的基地了解多少？}
### {654}{}{Not much. The old ship appeared in the port a few years ago. They are not allowed inside, the perimeter is well guarded. It is difficult for scouts to get there through the desert, besides, we have directed all our forces in another direction. You'll have to find out the details yourself.}
{654}{}{不多那艘旧船几年前出现在港口。他们是不允许进入的，周边有很好的防护。侦察兵很难穿过沙漠到达那里，此外，我们已经把所有的部队都引向了另一个方向。你必须自己找出细节。}
### {655}{}{I don't understand how such a closed organization was able to subdue so many settlements?}
{655}{}{我不明白这样一个封闭的组织怎么能制服这么多定居点？}
### {656}{}{Competent policy and good technical equipment. The Puerto military itself does not get involved in the internecine wars of Arizona. But they successfully provoke them. And when the shooting subsides, the settlements are headed by the people they need - puppets like Aaron.}
{656}{}{有能力的政策和良好的技术设备。波多黎各军队本身并没有卷入亚利桑那州的自相残杀的战争。但他们成功地激怒了他们。当枪击事件平息后，定居点由他们需要的人领导――像亚伦这样的木偶。}
### {657}{}{Why is this bad for Arizona?}
{657}{}{为什么这对亚利桑那州不利？}
### {658}{}{They carry their worldview by means of force, and this is unacceptable. Because of their policy, the settlements lose their sovereignty and find themselves in a servile position. After all, society is not ready for their progressive ideas.}
{658}{}{他们以武力的方式表达自己的世界观，这是不可接受的。由于他们的政策，定居点失去了主权，陷入了卑躬屈膝的境地。毕竟，社会还没有为他们的进步思想做好准备。}
### {659}{}{I see. Let's go back a bit.}
{659}{}{我明白了。让我们回到过去。}
