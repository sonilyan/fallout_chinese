#{100}{}{You see a mechanic.}
{100}{}{你看到一个机械师。}
#{101}{}{You see Francis, the mechanic.}
{101}{}{你看机械师弗朗西斯。}
#{102}{}{In front of you stands the mechanic of the Nuka-Cola factory.}
{102}{}{你面前站着努卡可乐厂的机械师。}
#{104}{}{Leave me alone!}
{104}{}{别管我！}
#{105}{}{Yeah baby! No wonder I'm the best mechanic at the factory!}
{105}{}{是的，宝贝！怪不得我是工厂里最好的机械师！}
#{106}{}{Technician was able to restore the on-board computer.}
{106}{}{技术人员能够恢复车载电脑。}
#{110}{}{A new face? Haven't seen you here before. Well, so many people are passing by here, you can't remember everyone. What do you want?}
{110}{}{新面孔？以前没在这里见过你。好吧，这么多人经过这里，你不可能记得每个人。你想要什么？}
#{111}{}{I would like to know who you are, for a start.}
{111}{}{首先，我想知道你是谁。}
#{112}{}{Say something already. What is it?}
{112}{}{说点什么吧。这是怎么一回事？}
#{113}{}{My name is Francis. I'm a mechanic, everything here is under my service... I mean the Nuka-Cola factory. And there is no need to be formal, I'm a simple man.}
{113}{}{我叫弗朗西斯。我是个机械师，这里的一切都由我负责...我是说努卡可乐厂。不需要拘谨，我是个简单的人。}
#{114}{}{You must be a skillful specialist. Perhaps I have a few questions.}
{114}{}{你一定是个技术娴熟的专家。也许我有几个问题。}
#{115}{}{That's all I wanted to know. Bye.}
{115}{}{我只想知道这些。再见。}
#{118}{}{Well, well. Wasn't you the one seen around here the day my welder disappeared? I don't want to accuse anyone without evidence, but... (points to one of his eyes, squinting the other) henceforth this eye of mine will follow every step of any visitor in the room. Keep that in mind, just in case.}
{118}{}{好吧，好吧。我的焊工失踪那天，你不是在这里被看到的那个人吗？我不想在没有证据的情况下指控任何人，但是...（指着他的一只眼睛，眯着另一只眼睛）从今以后，我的这只眼睛将跟随房间里任何来访者的每一步。记住这一点，以防万一。}
#{119}{}{Uh...}
{119}{}{Uh...}
#{120}{}{Can you upgrade my weapons?}
{120}{}{你能升级我的武器吗？}
#{121}{}{[Waving his arms] No, no and no again! I have nothing to do with arms and don't want to have! That's a risky business.}
{121}{}{不，不，再也不！我和武器没关系，也不想有！那是一件冒险的事。}
#{122}{}{Okay, let's talk about something else then.}
{122}{}{好吧，那我们谈点别的吧。}
#{123}{}{Then you lost a customer. Bye.}
{123}{}{然后你失去了一个顾客。再见。}
#{125}{}{Are you familiar with something from this list of the Vault-Tec technologies?}
{125}{}{您熟悉Vault Tec技术列表中的一些内容吗？}
#{126}{}{Vault-Tec you say? Let me see... I guess all this has something to do with the technology of vaults, that the Vault-Tec company has been building before the war. But in Salt Lake there is only one such vault, deep in the mountains, and it is still locked. However, you don't have to look there. I've also been running across Gas sensors in family shelters built by the Preiser Incorporated.}
{126}{}{你说什么？我想一下...我想这一切都与保险库技术有关，保险库技术公司在战前一直在建造。但在盐湖城只有一个这样的拱顶，在深山里，它仍然锁着。但是，你不必看那里。我也曾在Preiser公司建造的家庭庇护所里碰到过气体传感器。}
#{127}{}{Preiser... What?}
{127}{}{Preiser...什么？}
#{128}{}{Well, you know, before the war, there was another company building vaults for this city, but those were not as large, rather family-oriented, for a few people. There are two hundreds left around the Salt Lake, or maybe more, but almost all got looted or flooded. So, in 60 years after the war, there's almost nothing left in them, except rats and dampness. Still, some of the technology there remain to be found. I remember seeing that some had the Vault-Tec logo. Perhaps the company subcontracted for the technologies it couldn't develop itself.}
{128}{}{嗯，你知道，在战争之前，有另一家公司为这个城市建造了避难所，但这些避难所并没有那么大，对少数人来说是面向家庭的。盐湖周围还剩下两百人，也许更多，但几乎所有人都被洗劫一空或被洪水淹没。所以，在战后的60年里，除了老鼠和湿气，它们几乎什么都没有了。不过，那里的一些技术仍有待发现。我记得看到有些人有保险库的标志。也许这家公司把自己无法开发的技术转包出去了。}
#{129}{}{All right.}
{129}{}{好吧。}
#{130}{}{I was wondering, why the artesian water tower is not working? The city doesn't need clean water?}
{130}{}{我在想，为什么自流水塔不工作？城市不需要干净的水？}
#{131}{}{You are not the only one who has thoughts like this. But, alas - there's a problem with one detail that no one can find. The water cleaning filter. Without it the turbine becomes clogged with sand and will eventually halt. The Factory already tried to order it from the caravans. Probably everyone in Nevada knows about this problem by now, but so far no one has found the suitable part.}
{131}{}{不是只有你有这样的想法。但是，唉――有一个细节有问题，没人能找到。水清洗过滤器。如果没有它，涡轮机就会被沙子堵塞，最终会停止运转。工厂已经试着向商队订购了。也许现在内华达州的每个人都知道这个问题，但是到目前为止还没有人找到合适的部分。}
#{132}{}{So you are simply need to find this detail?}
{132}{}{所以你只需要找到这个细节？}
#{133}{}{Simply? Well, not quite. Even if someone will be able to find it, a feud bordering a civil war might erupt in the city over the right to possess the tower. We all need clean water: the Nuka-Cola factory, municipal government, population, local rich. And everyone will pursue their own goals. So the problem is broader than just finding some part. Talk about it with my boss, Director Skinner.}
{133}{}{简单地说？嗯，不完全是。即使有人能找到它，这座城市可能会因为拥有这座塔的权利而爆发内战。我们都需要干净的水：努卡可乐厂，市政府，人口，当地富人。每个人都会追求自己的目标。所以问题不仅仅是找到某个部分。和我的老板，斯金纳主任谈谈。}
#{134}{}{Well, thanks for the clarification.}
{134}{}{好吧，谢谢你的澄清。}
#{135}{}{You was of little use, but thanks anyway.}
{135}{}{你没什么用，不过还是谢谢你。}
#{150}{}{Can you make a press for ammo manufacturing?}
{150}{}{你能制造弹药吗？}
#{151}{}{Hmm, to made this thing, you see, would be very time-consuming. Perhaps, I would do this, but only for a very good payment. Let's say, 10,000 bucks.}
{151}{}{嗯，做这个东西，你看，会很费时。也许，我会这样做，但只是为了一个很好的报酬。比如说，一万块。}
#{152}{}{I'll give 5,000 as a deposit and the rest when the press is ready. Okay?}
{152}{}{我付5000英镑作为定金，其余的等记者准备好了再付。可以？}
#{153}{}{It's too expensive!}
{153}{}{太贵了！}
#{154}{}{I'll be fine without a press for now.}
{154}{}{现在没有媒体我就没事了。}
#{155}{}{Well, we're not getting anywhere like this.}
{155}{}{好吧，我们不会有这样的进展。}
#{156}{}{That's fair. But it will take a week, you will have to wait.}
{156}{}{这很公平。但这需要一个星期，你得等。}
#{157}{}{Fine by me. Here is the deposit.}
{157}{}{我很好。这是押金。}
#{158}{}{What?! I'm not going to make a discount over such a time-consuming process!}
{158}{}{什么？！我不会因为这么费时的过程而打折的！}
#{159}{}{I see...}
{159}{}{我懂了...}
#{160}{}{Very well! Come back in a week with the rest of the money.}
{160}{}{很好！一周后带着剩下的钱回来。}
#{161}{}{Okay.}
{161}{}{可以。}
#{170}{}{Did you finished it? My press for ammo manufacturing??}
{170}{}{你完成了吗？我的弹药制造媒体？？}
#{171}{}{Of course, as promised. But the bucks go first!}
{171}{}{当然，正如我所承诺的。但是雄鹿先走！}
#{172}{}{The residual sum, $ 5,000, as agreed.}
{172}{}{余款5000美元，按约定。}
#{173}{}{Wait, I'll get the money.}
{173}{}{等等，我去拿钱。}
#{174}{}{Don't you think that 10,000 is too much? What if I refuse?}
{174}{}{你不觉得一万太多了吗？如果我拒绝呢？}
#{175}{}{Well, considering your past services to the city, why not?! I will make a discount of 500 bucks, just out of respect.}
{175}{}{好吧，考虑到你过去对城市的服务，为什么不呢？！出于尊重，我可以打500美元的折扣。}
#{176}{}{Oh, with your other orders I have a lot of opportunities to make profit. You will have your discount, 500 bucks off.}
{176}{}{哦，你的其他订单我有很多获利的机会。你可以享受折扣，500美元。}
#{177}{}{The connection with such a forward-thinking merchant like you will make me good profits in the future. I will make a discount of 500 bucks, so be it.}
{177}{}{与你这样一个有远见的商人建立联系，将来会给我带来丰厚的利润。我会打500美元的折扣，就这样吧。}
#{178}{}{The price is all right. Anyway, you're not the kind of a Salt Lake resident I am willing to do any discounts to.}
{178}{}{价格还可以。不管怎样，你不是那种我愿意给你打折的盐湖居民。}
#{179}{}{Thanks, that's $ 4,500.}
{179}{}{谢谢，4500美元。}
#{180}{}{A pity. Then here are $ 5,000, as agreed.}
{180}{}{很遗憾。那么这是商定的5000美元。}
#{200}{}{Can you upgrade my armor?}
{200}{}{你能升级我的盔甲吗？}
#{201}{}{Oh, in that regard I am a true handyman! With a great pleasure. What kind this time?}
{201}{}{哦，在这方面我是个真正的勤杂工！非常荣幸。这次是什么样的？}
#{202}{}{}
{202}{}{}
#{203}{}{Metal armor.}
{203}{}{金属装甲。}
#{204}{}{Leather armor.}
{204}{}{皮甲。}
#{205}{}{Leather jacket.}
{205}{}{皮夹克。}
#{209}{}{Nothing special today.}
{209}{}{今天没什么特别的。}
#{210}{}{It won't make a good armor, but I can attach armor plates in order to improve protection from mechanical damage. The only drawback is that you won't be able to run as fast anymore.}
{210}{}{它不会成为一个好的装甲，但我可以附加装甲板，以提高对机械损伤的保护。唯一的缺点是你不能再跑那么快了。}
#{211}{}{Sure. If you bring me the jacket.}
{211}{}{当然。如果你把夹克给我。}
#{212}{}{Never mind then.}
{212}{}{那没关系。}
#{213}{}{}
{213}{}{}
#{214}{}{[Attach armor plates]}
{214}{}{[附加装甲板]}
#{215}{}{Nothing.}
{215}{}{没有什么。}
#{216}{}{That will cost you }
{216}{}{那会让你付出代价的}
#{217}{}{ bucks.}
{217}{}{美元。}
#{218}{}{Here is the money and a fortified leather jacket.}
{218}{}{这是钱和一件强化皮夹克。}
#{219}{}{Here is the money and a regular leather jacket.}
{219}{}{这是钱和一件普通的皮夹克。}
#{230}{}{A good choice for the novice traveler, such suit is often requested by the caravaneers. I can add multiple levels of additional protection. The armor will better protect from damage.}
{230}{}{对于新手旅行者来说，这是一个不错的选择，这样的套装经常被商队要求。我可以添加多个级别的附加保护。盔甲能更好地保护自己不受伤害。}
#{231}{}{[Strengthen the protection]}
{231}{}{【加强保护】}
#{232}{}{Sure. If you bring the armor.}
{232}{}{当然。如果你带上盔甲。}
#{233}{}{Here is the money and leather armor.}
{233}{}{这是钱和皮甲。}
#{240}{}{Yeah, I worked with such armor, too. I may replace some worn out plates and polish it. Will look almost as good as new!}
{240}{}{是啊，我也曾穿着这样的盔甲。我可以更换一些磨损的盘子并抛光。看起来几乎和新的一样好！}
#{241}{}{[Reinforce metal armor]}
{241}{}{[加固金属装甲]}
#{242}{}{[Put extra strengthening on M2]}
{242}{}{[对M2进行额外加固]}
#{243}{}{[Mirror coating for M2]}
{243}{}{【M2镜面涂层】}
#{244}{}{Here is the money and normal metal armor.}
{244}{}{这是钱和普通的金属盔甲。}
#{245}{}{Here is the money and M2 metal armor.}
{245}{}{这是钱和金属盔甲。}
#{246}{}{Here is the money and metal armor M2 with mirror surface.}
{246}{}{这是带镜面的货币和金属盔甲。}
#{247}{}{Here is the money and reinforced metal armor M2.}
{247}{}{这是钱和加固的金属盔甲。}
#{290}{}{(After the long work the master brings the finished item and nods approvingly to himself) Good work.}
{290}{}{（经过长时间的工作，主人带来了成品，赞许地点头）干得好。}
#{291}{}{Well, It's only requires to conduct a practical test.}
{291}{}{嗯，只需要做一个实际的测试。}
#{292}{}{Are you sure? Count accurately...}
{292}{}{你确定？准确计数...}
#{293}{}{Something is missing?..}
{293}{}{什么东西不见了？。。}
#{294}{}{Take off your armor.}
{294}{}{脱下你的盔甲。}
#{295}{}{Oh, sure...}
{295}{}{哦，当然...}
#{300}{}{They say you can stamp round metal plates?}
{300}{}{他们说你能在金属板上盖章？}
#{301}{}{Sure. Only I can do. What's the diameter?}
{301}{}{当然。只有我能做到。直径是多少？}
#{302}{}{As a normal coin.}
{302}{}{作为普通硬币。}
#{303}{}{Easy, like a  piece of ca... Wait! You think this is cool, smartass!? You'll pay if I catch you doing this! Skinner even appointed a reward for the thieves like that...}
{303}{}{简单，就像一块...等待！你觉得这很酷吗，蠢货！？如果我发现你这么做，你就要付出代价！斯金纳甚至给那些小偷定了一个赏金...}
#{304}{}{Hey, hey, I didn't do anything wrong yet!}
{304}{}{嘿，嘿，我还没做错什么！}
#{305}{}{Yet... Luckily for you. Otherwise me, Skinner and the Sheriff would have schooled you right away! And don't show me these innocent eyes! I know, where these chips will end up. Then the factory technicians get all this rubbish from the machines, and the chief starts questioning me when and for whom I made them. I've had enough! I won't be involved in such "orders" any more.}
{305}{}{然而...你真幸运。否则我，斯金纳和警长会马上教你的！别给我看这些无辜的眼睛！我知道，这些筹码会在哪里结束。然后工厂的技术人员从机器里取出所有的垃圾，主任开始质问我是什么时候为谁做的。我受够了！我不会再参与这种“命令”了。}
#{306}{}{Uh, well, do as you wish, old man...}
{306}{}{呃，好吧，随你的便，老头子...}
#{310}{}{The Director gave me the task to repair something called PLC.}
{310}{}{主任让我修理一种叫做PLC的东西。}
#{311}{}{Oh, yes, I've been informed. Here, take this. It's a pretty complicated thing. None of us are good in programming, and that is kind of experience that required here.}
{311}{}{哦，是的，我接到通知了。给，拿着这个。这是一件相当复杂的事情。我们都不擅长编程，这是这里需要的经验。}
#{312}{}{How to fix this?}
{312}{}{如何解决这个问题？}
#{313}{}{Well, you should know better, you are the one getting paid for it, heh. But actually, there are several options. The first is a technician in Las Vegas, which we were told about by the caravaneers. Also the bikers. These guys are crazy about old technology. And if you have the necessary skills yourself - then the entire fee is yours. If anything, the workbench is in the building in front of the office.}
{313}{}{好吧，你应该知道得更清楚，你才是得到报酬的人，呵呵。但实际上，有几种选择。第一个是拉斯维加斯的一个技术员，商队告诉我们。还有摩托车手。这些家伙对旧技术很着迷。如果你自己有必要的技能-那么所有的费用都是你的。如果有的话，工作台就在办公室前面的大楼里。}
#{314}{}{Tell me more about this device. Why is it necessary?}
{314}{}{告诉我有关这个设备的更多信息。为什么有必要？}
#{315}{}{About the technician in Vegas. Who is he?}
{315}{}{关于维加斯的技师。他是谁？}
#{316}{}{Bikers. How to contact them?}
{316}{}{骑自行车的。如何联系他们？}
#{317}{}{Okay, going to do the job.}
{317}{}{好吧，我去做这件事。}
#{318}{}{Great. Wait, there is one more thing - do not tell the locals about the controller. There are some people in Salt Lake, who better off not knowing, that we are restoring automatic systems.}
{318}{}{伟大的。等等，还有一件事-不要告诉当地人控制器的事。盐湖城有一些人，他们最好不知道，我们正在恢复自动系统。}
#{319}{}{Why?}
{319}{}{为什么？}
#{320}{}{Well, if you want to become a living target, then go ahead. However, in addition to those, who just want to get a profitable order, there are people like our pharmacist, who believe that fixing the factory would worsen already crappy environmental situation in the city. Oh yeah, and the people at the factory wouldn't be as needed as before - at least not as many - since the robots will work in their stead. Understand the subtlety? Then keep your mouth shut, if you don't want to lose the opportunity to earn some.}
{320}{}{好吧，如果你想成为一个活的目标，那就去吧。然而，除了那些只想得到一个有利可图的订单的人之外，还有像我们药剂师这样的人，他们认为修复工厂会恶化城市已经糟糕的环境状况。哦，是的，工厂里的人不会像以前那样需要了――至少没有以前那么多了――因为机器人将代替他们工作。明白其中的微妙之处吗？如果你不想失去挣钱的机会，那就闭嘴吧。}
#{321}{}{All right.}
{321}{}{好吧。}
#{322}{}{The Programmable Logic Controller. It is needed for the automatic control of different appliances. Imagine, we can connect to it all the conveyors, actuators, manipulators, sensors, loading cranes and all-everything you need for autonomous work of the factory. People will only walk between the machines, monitor and supervise them in order to avoid accidents.}
{322}{}{可编程逻辑控制器。需要它来自动控制不同的电器。想象一下，我们可以连接到它所有的输送机，执行机构，机械手，传感器，装载起重机和所有你需要的工厂自主工作。人们只会在机器之间走动，监视和监督机器，以免发生事故。}
#{323}{}{Caravaneers told me that there's a guy at the Hoover dam in Vegas, who has exceptional talent in electronics. If true, he is the one who can repair the controller.}
{323}{}{商队的人告诉我在维加斯的胡佛大坝有个家伙，他在电子方面有着非凡的天赋。如果是真的，他就是那个能修理控制器的人。}
#{324}{}{I don't know about this. They usually don't inform you when they are going to the city. Their base is somewhere in another place. Surely, the Sheriff should know, he would've found out everything he could about the guys like them.}
{324}{}{我不知道这件事。他们去城里时通常不通知你。他们的基地在另一个地方。当然，警长应该知道，他会尽他所能找到像他们这样的人的一切。}
#{325}{}{Tell me again about the PLC.}
{325}{}{再跟我说说PLC。}
#{326}{}{I managed to fix the controller.}
{326}{}{我设法修好了控制器。}
#{327}{}{Really? [run some checks] It really works! Wonderful. Now get it to the Director Skinner.}
{327}{}{真正地？[检查一下]真的很管用！精彩的。现在把它交给斯金纳主任。}
#{328}{}{All right.}
{328}{}{好吧。}
#{329}{}{But wouldn't that mean that part of the workforce will not be needed any more?}
{329}{}{但这难道不意味着不再需要一部分劳动力了吗？}
#{330}{}{You sound like that nerdy pharmacist. Of course, the Director will be able to fire a few slackers. But not even a half! Even automated machines need monitoring and care. And for this task people are needed. Novadays you can't trust tech much.}
{330}{}{你听起来像个书呆子似的药剂师。当然，导演可以解雇一些懒汉。但连一半都没有！即使是自动化机器也需要监控和护理。为了完成这项任务，需要人。现在你不能太相信科技。}
#{350}{}{I need to fix this computer. Will you do it?}
{350}{}{我需要修理这台电脑。你愿意吗？}
#{351}{}{[After seeing the device Francis stops and quietly looks at you for some time, not knowing how to answer] What is it? The computer from the train, right? OK, I'll tell it like it is. Locals, including myself, are intimidated by the train depot. Sheriff, Mormons, ghost train, service robots... I have many reasons not to even think about it. My skin is more important than any amount of money.}
{351}{}{[看到设备后，弗朗西斯停了下来，静静地看着你一段时间，不知道如何回答]这是什么？火车上的电脑，对吧？好吧，我会如实告诉你的。包括我在内的当地人都被火车站吓坏了。警长，摩门教徒，幽灵火车，服务机器人...我有很多理由不去想它。我的皮肤比任何钱都重要。}
#{352}{}{What does the Sheriff say?}
{352}{}{警长怎么说？}
#{353}{}{The Mormons? How are they related?}
{353}{}{摩门教徒？他们有什么关系？}
#{354}{}{The ghost train? What kind of a fairy-tale it is?}
{354}{}{幽灵火车？这是一个什么样的童话？}
#{355}{}{Robots? At the station?}
{355}{}{机器人？在车站？}
#{356}{}{Okay, forget my offer, I'll deal without you.}
{356}{}{好吧，忘了我的提议吧，我不带你去处理。}
#{357}{}{Sheriff forbade us to go there. He says it is very dangerous. And not without a reason. Once in a while a new rumor appears about the brave men who left there and never came back. I don't know what is happening there and I don't want to know.}
{357}{}{治安官禁止我们去那里。他说这很危险。也不是没有理由的。偶尔会有一个新的谣言出现，关于那些离开那里却再也没有回来的勇士们。我不知道那里发生了什么，我也不想知道。}
#{358}{}{Sheriff has entrusted them with the surveillance of the dangerous territory. Better ask them themselves. They live in the North, near the destroyed part of the city.}
{358}{}{警长委托他们监视这片危险地区。最好问问他们自己。他们住在北方，靠近城市被摧毁的部分。}
#{359}{}{A fairy-tale!? You call it a fairy-tale?! There were the brave ones who tried to ride the train, like on a rodeo, you know. And to what avail? Should one touch its black body and he will immediately be electrocuted to ash! It's not a fairy-tale. Although there are very few of those who actually saw it... And for sure I'm not one of them.}
{359}{}{童话故事！？你管它叫童话？！有一些勇敢的人想坐火车，就像参加竞技表演一样，你知道的。又有什么用呢？如果有人碰了它黑色的身体，他会立刻被电死！这不是童话。虽然真正看到它的人很少...当然我不是他们中的一员。}
#{360}{}{Service robots, they are repairing the road and the station since the times even before the war. It is difficult to say who or what controls them, but they act together. Those who tried to interfere with them or to go into the danger zone received a portion of plasma in the ass. So they are a real fact, more real than any ghost train.}
{360}{}{服务机器人，他们甚至在战前就开始修理道路和车站。很难说是谁或什么控制了他们，但他们是一起行动的。那些试图干扰他们或进入危险区的人，屁股里会有一部分等离子。所以他们是真实的事实，比任何幽灵火车都真实。}
#{361}{}{You seem to have no trust in me, Francis, why?}
{361}{}{你好像不信任我，弗朗西斯，为什么？}
#{362}{}{What did you do to earn it? I can't recall you having particularly credible reputation in the city. So if you want to fix the device - go to some other place.}
{362}{}{你是怎么赚的？我想不起来你在这个城市有什么特别可靠的名声。所以如果你想修理这个装置-去别的地方。}
#{363}{}{No, no it's not about you. People say good things about you, some even claim you're a hero. But I'm scared of the Mormons and the Sheriff.}
{363}{}{不，不，这和你无关。人们说你很好，有些人甚至说你是英雄。但我害怕摩门教徒和警长。}
#{364}{}{You shouldn't think that. I have all the right connections to protect both of us. So, will you help me?}
{364}{}{你不应该这么想。我有足够的人脉来保护我们俩。那么，你能帮我吗？}
#{365}{}{No, wait, don't push me, let me think... You, of course, is able to organize this, but why would I want to expose myself to such risks? Here is the deal, bring me $ 1,000, then we'll quietly try to settle this problem.}
{365}{}{不，等等，别逼我，让我想想...当然，你有能力组织这件事，但我为什么要冒这样的风险呢？这是交易，给我1000美元，然后我们会悄悄地解决这个问题。}
#{366}{}{Here's the money and the computer. Get to work, I need the results as soon as possible.}
{366}{}{这是钱和电脑。开始工作吧，我需要尽快得到结果。}
#{367}{}{Well, you know how to gain the trust. Here, take it and don't let anyone see. I don't want any problems hanging over my head.}
{367}{}{嗯，你知道如何获得信任。拿着，别让任何人看到。我不想任何问题困扰着我。}
#{368}{}{Okay.}
{368}{}{可以。}
#{400}{}{Would you believe it, I have my own car! You jealous?}
{400}{}{你相信吗，我有自己的车！你嫉妒吗？}
#{401}{}{So, what improvements you can do to my pickup truck?}
{401}{}{那么，你能对我的皮卡做些什么改进？}
#{402}{}{[Snorts haughty] And I have my own factory producing Cola. But... Shit, you weren't kidding!? Unbelievable! Let me see, just one look! Nowadays it's a rare thing to find...}

#{403}{}{Rare? Hey, wait a minute! So I'm not the only one with the wheels!?}
{403}{}{罕见？嘿，等等！所以我不是唯一一个有轮子的人！？}
#{404}{}{Of course, you are not! In the past the city was an industrial center, there are lots of working machinery, but it has fallen into disrepair because of the climate and the bombing of the Northern part of the city. From time to time someone finds cars in old garages, launches them and...}
{404}{}{当然，你不是！过去这座城市是一个工业中心，有许多工作机械，但由于气候和城市北部的轰炸，它已经年久失修。不时有人在旧车库里发现汽车，发动汽车，然后...}
#{405}{}{And?!}
{405}{}{然后呢？！}
#{406}{}{And nothing. It's quite a challenge to find proper tires nowadays. After half a century they fell into disrepair. But the main problem is all these kinds of chips and regulators. Even before the war it was difficult to find them, and now it's almost impossible.}
{406}{}{什么都没有。现在要找到合适的轮胎是一个很大的挑战。半个世纪后，他们年久失修。但主要的问题是所有这些类型的芯片和监管机构。即使在战争之前也很难找到他们，现在几乎不可能了。}
#{407}{}{And how many of such lucky guys are in Salt Lake City?!}
{407}{}{盐湖城有多少这样的幸运儿？！}
#{408}{}{Let me count... Hmm... For the past twenty years I've met about a dozen working cars, also the bikes the bikers ride. But we also have other self-propelled machines. For example, cars at the factory.}
{408}{}{让我数一数...Hmm...在过去的二十年里，我见过十几辆工作车，还有骑自行车的人骑的自行车。但我们也有其他自动推进的机器。例如，工厂里的汽车。}
#{409}{}{I see you have some experience with handling vehicles, so - can you say something about my baby?}
{409}{}{我看你有处理车辆的经验，所以-你能说说我的孩子吗？}
#{410}{}{Would love to, just let me touch her sides!}
{410}{}{很乐意，就让我摸摸她的身体吧！}
#{411}{}{Let's go, I'll show it to you.}
{411}{}{走吧，我给你看。}
#{412}{}{You should wait until I drive her to the entrance.}
{412}{}{你应该等到我开车送她到门口。}
#{413}{}{Oh, my God! [clutches his head] It's the ultimate creation of "Chryslus motors"! The most passable all-terrain car I've ever heard of! Damn, now I'm really jealous.}
{413}{}{哦，天哪！[抓住他的头]这是“Chryslus motors”的终极创造！我听过的最舒适的全地形车！妈的，现在我真的嫉妒了。}
#{414}{}{Yeah! As I said!}
{414}{}{是 啊！就像我说的！}
#{415}{}{Well, of course, in our times one can be happy to own any working car, but even tech like this has some flaws, which can be worked on.}
{415}{}{当然，在我们这个时代，一个人可以很高兴拥有任何一辆可以工作的汽车，但即使是这样的技术也有一些缺陷，可以加以改进。}
#{416}{}{Flaws? I see, apparently, you decided to make some money on me!}
{416}{}{瑕疵？我明白了，很明显，你决定在我身上赚点钱！}
#{417}{}{I'm curious, what do you suggest?}
{417}{}{我很好奇，你有什么建议？}
#{418}{}{Allowing someone to meddle with my car? Hands off! That's my car!}
{418}{}{允许别人乱动我的车？把手拿开！那是我的车！}
#{419}{}{Of course, of course! As you say. It's just an offer.}
{419}{}{当然，当然！就像你说的。这只是一个提议。}
#{420}{}{What do you want to offer?}
{420}{}{你想提供什么？}
#{421}{}{I'm still not interested in what you were going to offer. I'm leaving.}
{421}{}{我还是对你的提议不感兴趣。我要走了。}
#{422}{}{Well, although I am a fan of hardware gizmos, I haven't learned to eat them for lunch yet...}
{422}{}{嗯，虽然我是一个硬件小发明的爱好者，但我还没有学会午餐吃它们...}
#{423}{}{So what's your offer?}
{423}{}{那你有什么提议？}
#{424}{}{}
{424}{}{}
#{425}{}{Exclusively practical solution: firstly, to cut out the excess metal to reduce the weight of the machine, then to build a new, sturdy frame over the trunk. I have all I need to do this.}
{425}{}{唯一实用的解决方案：首先，切断多余的金属以减轻机器的重量，然后在后备箱上建造一个新的、坚固的框架。我有我需要做的一切。}
#{426}{}{Increasing the capacity of the trunk? That would be great. How much is the costs?}
{426}{}{增加后备箱的容量？那太好了。费用是多少？}
#{427}{}{Well, I'm not interested. I'll be back if I change my mind.}
{427}{}{嗯，我不感兴趣。如果我改变主意，我会回来的。}
#{428}{}{ And this smelly tent - oh man, yuck! - to the dump!}
{428}{}{还有这个臭烘烘的帐篷-哦，天哪，恶心！-去垃圾场！}
#{430}{}{Counting with some charge for works it's about }
{430}{}{算上一些工程费用}
#{431}{}{ bucks.}
{431}{}{美元。}
#{432}{}{I like the price. Here is the money. Now to the work!}
{432}{}{我喜欢这个价格。这是钱。现在开始工作！}
#{433}{}{Give me time to think. In case I find somewhere a cheaper solution...}
{433}{}{给我时间想想。万一我找到便宜的解决办法...}
#{434}{}{Francis improved the trunk of your pickup. Now you can place 20% more stuff there.}
{434}{}{弗朗西斯改进了你皮卡的后备箱。现在你可以多放20%的东西了。}
#{435}{}{Francis improved the trunk of your pickup. Now you can place 40% more stuff there.}
{435}{}{弗朗西斯改进了你皮卡的后备箱。现在你可以多放40%的东西了。}
#{436}{}{Well, then drive the car to the entrance of the factory, and I will start working.}
{436}{}{好吧，那就把车开到工厂门口，我就开始工作了。}
#{437}{}{I'll go get the car.}
{437}{}{我去拿车。}
#{500}{}{What's all that junk on your desk?}
{500}{}{你桌子上那些垃圾是什么？}
#{501}{}{Oh, that's a damn pile of polymers, metals and ceramics with which I can't do a damn thing for a few months already... Why do you ask?}
{501}{}{哦，那是一堆该死的聚合物，金属和陶瓷，我已经有几个月不能用它们做任何事情了...你为什么问？}
#{502}{}{It looks like parts of a robot...}
{502}{}{看起来像是机器人的零件...}
#{503}{}{In some way, this is a robot. In fact, you're looking at the glory of the former American army - the suit of T-51b power armor. Or rather what's left of it. It was found in the north, among the ruins of the bombed part of the city. Something caused disintegration of the internal power module, which in the end exploded almost entire armor. Little is left in working condition.}
{503}{}{在某种程度上，这是一个机器人。事实上，你看到的是前美国军队的荣耀――T-51b动力装甲套装。或者更确切地说是剩下的。它是在北部城市被轰炸部分的废墟中发现的。某种东西导致了内部电源模块的解体，最终几乎炸毁了整个装甲。在工作状态下所剩无几。}
#{504}{}{But can it be fixed?}
{504}{}{但能修好吗？}
#{505}{}{If someone finds the suitable replacement parts and original blueprints, then of course. But finding them is nearly impossible.}
{505}{}{如果有人找到合适的替换零件和原始蓝图，那么当然。但找到它们几乎是不可能的。}
#{506}{}{Hypothetically - where can I get the necessary parts?}
{506}{}{假设-我在哪里可以得到必要的零件？}
#{507}{}{What exactly needs replacing?}
{507}{}{到底需要更换什么？}
#{508}{}{I want to buy the armor in working condition.}
{508}{}{我想买工作状态的盔甲。}
#{509}{}{About the power armor. Is it still possible to repair?}
{509}{}{关于动力装甲。还可以修理吗？}
#{510}{}{About the power armor.}
{510}{}{关于动力装甲。}
#{511}{}{We'll talk more about it. Later.}
{511}{}{我们会再谈的。以后再说。}
#{512}{}{Hmm, I think on military bases, where else? But all I know about them is only by hearsay. Except there was one to the North, but it has been destroyed by a direct hit of a nuclear bomb.}
{512}{}{嗯，我想在军事基地，还有什么地方？但我所知道的只是道听途说。除了北边有一个，但它已经被核弹直接击中摧毁了。}
#{513}{}{So, let me think... First thing - you need blueprints. Next, we need to replace some parts... To be precise, it's the CPU, power module, new helmet, and in addition - new layerы of radiation and gas protection.}
{513}{}{所以，让我想想...首先-你需要蓝图。接下来，我们需要更换一些零件...准确地说，它是CPU，电源模块，新头盔，以及新的辐射和气体保护层。}
#{514}{}{I want it even more! Here's the deal - you will find details, and I'll fix the armor and give it to you. Of course, I would like to get something for myself, in exchange.}
{514}{}{我更想要它！交易是这样的-你会找到细节的，我会修好盔甲给你。当然，作为交换，我想给自己买点东西。}
#{515}{}{That's the deal then!}
{515}{}{那就这么定了！}
#{516}{}{I'll think about it.}
{516}{}{我会考虑的。}
#{517}{}{Great. I need to get the blueprints. I don't know where to get them, but I know that one of those bikers from the west has the *working* power armor suit. Perhaps he could share some information with you. Again, I have no idea where those bikers reside. But the Sheriff knows for sure.}
{517}{}{伟大的。我要拿到蓝图。我不知道从哪里弄到，但我知道其中一个从西方来的摩托车手有一套“工作”动力盔甲。也许他可以和你分享一些信息。再说一次，我不知道那些骑自行车的人住在哪里。但警长肯定知道。}
#{518}{}{Bikers? How interesting.}
{518}{}{摩托车手？真有趣。}
#{519}{}{Oh, this is just what was needed! A lot of troubles ahead with finding replacements for the damaged areas of the armored hull, but now, thanks to the blueprints, it will be much easier. This is a great find! Too bad it's useful only for external reconstruction.}
{519}{}{哦，这正是我们需要的！在寻找装甲船体受损区域的替代品之前，会遇到很多麻烦，但是现在，多亏了设计图，这会容易得多。这是一个伟大的发现！可惜它只对外部重建有用。}
#{520}{}{What exactly?}
{520}{}{到底是什么？}
#{521}{}{Let's discuss the first phase of the repairing. What needs to be done?}
{521}{}{我们来讨论一下修理的第一阶段。需要做什么？}
#{522}{}{Nothing.}
{522}{}{没有什么。}
#{523}{}{Let's discuss the second phase of the repairing.}
{523}{}{我们来讨论第二阶段的修理。}
#{524}{}{Let's discuss the third phase of the repairing.}
{524}{}{让我们来讨论第三阶段的修复。}
#{525}{}{With pleasure! The first thing that needs recovering is the armor's hull. It is not that easy. High quality polymers, cermets and special fasteners were used. I need the blueprints to understand how all of it was previously assembled. The situation with materials is tight, but finding them is still possible.}
{525}{}{很高兴见到你！首先需要修复的是装甲的外壳。没那么容易。使用了高质量的聚合物、金属陶瓷和特殊的紧固件。我需要设计图来了解它是如何组装的。材料的情况很紧张，但找到它们还是有可能的。}
#{526}{}{I have a broken power armor. Will it be enough to restore the hull?}
{526}{}{我的能量护甲坏了。足以修复船体吗？}
#{527}{}{I have blueprints of the frame structure!}
{527}{}{我有框架结构的蓝图！}
#{528}{}{Where I can find them?}
{528}{}{我在哪里能找到他们？}
#{529}{}{The blueprints are needed... Got it. Went to look.}
{529}{}{需要蓝图...知道了。我去看了看。}
#{530}{}{If I knew, I would have fixed this scrap long ago. But there is one guess, sometimes the bikers come here from the west. One of them is wearing a suit of power armor. Perhaps he could share information.}
{530}{}{如果我知道的话，我早就修好了。但有一种猜测，有时骑自行车的人是从西方来的。其中一个穿着一套强力盔甲。也许他可以分享信息。}
#{531}{}{I see. Get to go on further searches.}
{531}{}{我懂了。继续进一步的搜索。}
#{532}{}{Oh, this is just what was needed! I could not only use the armor as an archetype to base the restored parts upon, but I can also take the missing parts of the armored layer from it. This is a great find! Too bad it's useful only for external reconstruction.}
{532}{}{哦，这正是我们需要的！我不仅可以使用盔甲作为原型，以恢复的部分为基础，但我也可以从它的装甲层丢失的部分。这是一个伟大的发现！可惜它只对外部重建有用。}
#{533}{}{Do at least that for now.}
{533}{}{至少现在是这样。}
#{534}{}{Ready! Looks spectacular, doesn't it? Oh, of course, it's still just a pile of metal. Without the power module there is no sense to try wearing it - too heavy. Let it lay on the table for now, It won't go anywhere.}
{534}{}{准备好了！看起来很壮观，不是吗？哦，当然了，还是一堆金属。如果没有电源模块，尝试戴它是没有意义的-太重了。现在就让它躺在桌子上吧，它哪儿也去不了。}
#{535}{}{Very well. What is next?}
{535}{}{很好。下一步是什么？}
#{536}{}{Great. Will continue this another time.}
{536}{}{伟大的。下次再继续。}
#{537}{}{Now you need to restore the impermeability of the hull. The layers of radiation and gas protections are burned out and the helmet is completely smashed to pieces. I have to replace all of it with something improvised. Write it down, in case your memory fails you. I need: a sealed helmet, a gas-protection suit and an anti-radiation jumpsuit.}
{537}{}{现在你需要恢复船体的抗渗性。辐射层和气体保护层被烧毁，头盔被完全砸碎。我必须用一些即兴创作的东西来代替它。写下来，以防你记性不好。我需要：一顶密封头盔，一套防毒服和一套防辐射服。}
#{538}{}{I have a anti-radiation jumpsuit.}
{538}{}{我有防辐射的连身衣。}
#{539}{}{I have a gas-protection suit.}
{539}{}{我有防毒服。}
#{540}{}{I have a lab helmet.}

#{547}{}{Ready! We have moved another step forward!}
{547}{}{准备好了！我们又向前迈进了一步！}
#{548}{}{That's good.}
{548}{}{那很好。}
#{549}{}{Great news! The hull is restored. Would be great to celebrate this with a bottle of "Bloody Mary", and yet the most difficult part of work is still ahead. So it's too early to rejoice.}
{549}{}{好消息！船体被修复了。如果能用一瓶“血腥玛丽”来庆祝这一点就太好了，然而最困难的工作还在后面。所以现在高兴还为时过早。}
#{550}{}{Good to hear it. And what else remains to be done?}
{550}{}{很高兴听到。还有什么事情要做？}
#{551}{}{Great, but let's continue later.}
{551}{}{太好了，但我们稍后再继续。}
#{552}{}{The most difficult part is recovering an autonomous system. This kind of armor is distinguished by the inclusion of power module, which provides the mobility of the exoskeleton and increases the strength of the wearer. The systems were powered by the internal mini-reactor and controlled by a central processor. All of it was destroyed. We will have to look for replacements, since it's not possible for us to produce things like that from scratch. In addition, I will need the blueprints of the internal structure, otherwise it'll take years to do the analysis on disassembling. Now write down what's needed: an autonomous system, the CPU and blueprints.}
{552}{}{最困难的部分是恢复一个自治系统。这种装甲的特点是包含了电源模块，它提供了外骨骼的灵活性，并增加了佩戴者的力量。这些系统由内部微型反应堆提供动力，并由中央处理器控制。全部被毁了。我们将不得不寻找替代品，因为我们不可能从头开始生产这样的产品。另外，我需要内部结构的蓝图，否则要花很多年的时间来分析拆卸。现在写下需要什么：一个自治系统，CPU和蓝图。}
#{553}{}{I have the CPU.}
{553}{}{我有中央处理器。}
#{554}{}{I have an autonomous system.}

#{556}{}{I have a broken power armor. Can it be used?}
{556}{}{我的能量护甲坏了。能用吗？}
#{557}{}{I see. Will look for it.}
{557}{}{我懂了。我会找的。}
#{558}{}{Oh, yes, this is just what's needed! But I will also need blueprints and an autonomous system.}
{558}{}{哦，是的，这正是我们需要的！但我也需要蓝图和自主系统。}
#{559}{}{Oh, yes, this is just what's needed! But I also need the blueprints and the CPU.}
{559}{}{哦，是的，这正是我们需要的！但我还需要蓝图和CPU。}
#{560}{}{Oh, yes, this is just what's needed! But I also need an autonomous system and the CPU.}
{560}{}{哦，是的，这正是我们需要的！但我也需要一个自主系统和CPU。}
#{561}{}{Oh, yes, this is just what's needed! And I won't even need the blueprints.}
{561}{}{哦，是的，这正是我们需要的！我甚至不需要蓝图。}
#{562}{}{I've got everything you need. So don't be lazy, please - the final stage is ahead!}
{562}{}{我有你需要的一切。所以，请不要偷懒，最后阶段就在前面！}
#{563}{}{So, we have everything needed to finish the work!}
{563}{}{所以，我们有完成这项工作所需要的一切！}
#{564}{}{Oh, great! I'm ready to begin the last phase of reconstruction, but there is one controversial point - in fact, until now I worked for free, while you were searching for the necessary parts. So which of us owns the armor now? Admit it, the one who would own it should compensate the efforts of the other.}
{564}{}{哦，太好了！我已经准备好开始重建的最后一个阶段了，但有一点有争议――事实上，直到现在，我都是免费工作的，而你们在寻找必要的部分。我们谁现在拥有盔甲？承认吧，拥有它的一方应该补偿另一方的努力。}

{570}{}{这笔钱我买不起。我们可以改天再谈。}
#{571}{}{Well, I almost envy you, although I got tons of fun and money myself off that work. Things like these are not lying around every corner and you most likely will never come across anything like that anymore... You know, if I were in your place, I'd have given the armor its own name. Like, for example, "Grizzly". What do you think? As for me, it suits well.}
{571}{}{好吧，我几乎嫉妒你，虽然我从那份工作中得到了很多乐趣和金钱。像这样的事情不是到处都是，你很可能再也不会遇到这样的事情了...你知道，如果我在你的位置，我会给盔甲起个名字。比如说“灰熊”。你怎么认为？对我来说，这很合适。}
#{572}{}{"Grizzly" power armor? That's a great name!}
