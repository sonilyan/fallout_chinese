Like, that they were just holding me back. Yeah... And you, bitch, always remember this as *your* sign from fate. Remember the day *I* let *you* live. You better pray we never meet again.}
{127}{}{那是。。。胡说八道！我甚至一度相信你，但不，你只是个求饶的婊子。但是。。。也许，如果他们死了，而我还活着。。。也许这是个征兆。就像，他们只是在牵制我。是 啊。。。而你，婊子，永远记住这是命运给你的信号。记住我让你活着的那一天。你最好祈祷我们再也不会见面。}
#{128}{}{Even if you do kill me, my bosses in Reno won't rest until they find you.}
{128}{}{即使你真的杀了我，我在雷诺的老板在找到你之前也不会罢休。}
