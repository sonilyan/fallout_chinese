#{550}{}{Personal log, last entry:                                       AGAIN, Cecilia sent me a reminder that the service robot in the canteen is broken. She just has to wait a little more, the requisition for commissioning of additional security robots is of much higher priority. I've been working on it for quite some time, I was able to connect six robots into the grid, but I still have one that will take a lot of work - CPU card is fried, motivator is missing, and the minigun was removed pretty clumsily. Dammit, just the search for the parts will be a lot on my nerves, I better take some time off first. Nobody will be furious because of one security robot.}
{550}{}{个人日志，最后一条：再次，塞西莉亚给我发了一个提醒，食堂里的服务机器人坏了。她只需要再等一点，请求额外的安全机器人的调试就有更高的优先级。我已经做了很长一段时间了，我可以把六个机器人连接到电网中，但是我还有一个需要做很多工作――CPU卡烧坏了，激励器不见了，微型枪被笨拙地拆除了。该死的，只是找零件会让我很紧张，我最好先休息一下。没有人会因为一个安全机器人而愤怒。}
