And there was a time when he got ambushed by a pack of scorpions and killed them all!! He even saved me from a Chimera once! And he stopped an assault on NWO! And prevented the contamination of groundwater! And you should hear about him dealing with a huge, three-meter tall murderous robot! That's just fantastic!!}

### {240}{}{That is a very fascinating story! One time, Cyren and his partner went on a mission to somewhere near the Rainbow and walked into some settlement to get rest and resupply. They were already going to have lunch in one of the homes when they heard screaming from the streets. Cyren ran outside and found out that the village was attacked by Jackals! There were no less than twenty of them, and Cyren had only a spoon in his hand, with all his stuff left inside the house. Despite that, he threw himself at the enemy, killing them one by one!! Jackals ran off, so Cyren has been chasing them for several following days, killing every last one. Unfortunately, everyone in that village turned out to be dead, including his partner, and everything else - burned to the ground, including his equipment. So, Cyren came back with only a spoon, every witness of his doings - dead.}
{240}{}{这是一个非常引人入胜的故事！有一次，赛伦和他的伙伴去彩虹附近的某个地方执行任务，走进一些定居点休息和补给。他们正要在其中一户人家吃午饭，突然听到街上传来尖叫声。赛伦跑到外面，发现村子被豺狼袭击了！他们不下二十个人，赛伦手里只有一把勺子，所有的东西都留在屋里了。尽管如此，他还是扑向敌人，一个接一个地杀死了他们！！豺狼逃跑了，所以赛伦在接下来的几天里一直在追赶它们，杀死了最后一只。不幸的是，那个村子里的每个人都死了，包括他的伴侣和其他一切――被烧成了平地，包括他的设备。于是，赛伦回来时只带了一把勺子，所有见证他的人都死了。}

### {250}{}{In this story, Cyren demonstrated his great skill and endurance. One day, Cyren and his partner ended up in a narrow mountain passage. Everything was very silent, Cyren immediately suspected that something is wrong. Suddenly, swarms of scorpions launched an attack on them, coming from both sides, from the top, crawling from under the cliffs and stones! Cyren even got stung in a leg by one of these filthy creatures! But he didn't get scared - he grabbed the nearest scorpion, ripped off his tail, and started to sting other scorpions with it!! And he fended them off until none left. Only after that, he bandaged his leg - he survived a dose of poison which was twice the lethal! Unfortunately, his partner died almost instantly. Cyren got back in a few days, brought tail with him, and showed everyone the leg wound, which healed and was looking like a little scratch!}
{250}{}{在这个故事中，赛伦展示了他的高超技艺和耐力。一天，赛伦和他的伙伴来到了一条狭窄的山路上。一切都很沉默，赛伦立刻怀疑出了什么问题。突然，成群的蝎子向它们发起了攻击，从两侧、顶部、悬崖和石头下爬来！赛伦甚至被这些肮脏的生物蜇了一条腿！但他并没有害怕――他抓住离他最近的蝎子，扯下尾巴，开始用它蜇其他蝎子！！他把他们挡开，直到没有人离开。只是在那之后，他包扎了自己的腿――他在一剂致命性两倍的毒药中幸存了下来！不幸的是，他的伴侣几乎当场死亡。几天后，赛伦回来了，带着尾巴，向大家展示了腿上的伤口，伤口愈合了，看起来像一个小抓痕！}

{257}{999}{我想去看看他的伤口。我很感兴趣。}

### {260}{}{This one is my favorite! That's when I met Cyren and fell in love with him. It all started on a Rainbow, where I lived and worked. Women there have only one work, you know. I didn't mind it - no need to think much, and I became pretty good at my duties. But one time, a client started chasing me to beat me up, so I ran away. I wandered around the desert for some time, before I fell exhausted near some stone. That's where Cyren found me. He was incredible! He woke me up, shared his food, and offered help. Then he pulled me aside and showed me a Chimera's corpse - he killed her while I was unconscious. She could eat me in my sleep! This Chimera smelled like a Lavash who has been dead for a week... I get goosebumps even thinking about it. So, I thanked Cyren the way I was taught in Rainbow. We've been together since. }
{260}{}{这是我的最爱！就在那时，我遇到了赛伦，并爱上了他。这一切都始于我生活和工作的彩虹。你知道，那里的女人只有一份工作。我并不介意――不需要想太多，我变得非常擅长我的职责。但有一次，一个客户开始追我打我，所以我逃跑了。我在沙漠里徘徊了一段时间，然后筋疲力尽地倒在一块石头旁。赛伦就是在那里找到我的。他太棒了！他叫醒了我，分享了他的食物，并提供了帮助。然后他把我拉到一边，给我看了一具奇美拉的尸体――他在我昏迷时杀死了她。她可以在我睡觉的时候吃掉我！这个奇美拉闻起来像一个已经死了一个星期的熔岩。。。我一想到它就起鸡皮疙瘩。所以，我感谢赛伦在彩虹教我的方式。从那以后我们一直在一起。}

### {270}{}{That's when Cyren acted like a true hero! He didn't even tell anyone about this one, because he is very humble. That's how it was: Cyren was absent for a few days. Then he returned and started doing his usual business as if nothing happened. But later, people started talking that some huge battle took place, not very far away from here. They suggested that two rival gangs had fought over something, with heavy casualties from both sides. But then Cyren told everyone the truth - actually, two gangs wanted to join forces to attack the NWO. And Cyren decided to meet them on their way to the town. He stormed into a crowd of enemies and killed them all! And he didn't want to cause panic in the NWO, so he kept it silent. He didn't even want to show where the battle took place! Everyone here is in great debt to him!}
{270}{}{那时候赛伦表现得像个真正的英雄！他甚至没有告诉任何人这件事，因为他很谦虚。事情就是这样：赛伦缺席了几天。然后他回来了，开始做他平常的事情，好像什么都没发生一样。但后来，人们开始谈论，在离这里不远的地方发生了一场巨大的战斗。他们暗示，两个敌对帮派为了什么发生了争执，双方都有重大伤亡。但后来赛伦告诉了所有人真相――事实上，两个帮派想联合起来袭击NWO。赛伦决定在他们进城的路上与他们见面。他冲进一群敌人，把他们都杀了！他不想在NWO引起恐慌，所以他保持沉默。他甚至不想显示战斗发生在哪里！这里的每个人都欠他一大笔债！}

### {280}{}{This is a story where he saved the whole Radius from dying out! Cyren and his partner went scouting to the farthest reaches, near Tin Industries. And they stumbled upon some scientist on the way. That scientist turned out to be a total psycho - he wanted to destroy all life in Radius! Cyren decided to prevent it and talked the scientist into trusting him. So, the psycho planned to pollute all groundwater with toxic waste, left from before the War. He even showed his barrels with waste! And Cyren burned them, together with the scientist! Unfortunately, his partner died too, inhaling all the poisonous fumes. Later, Cyren showed everyone the pile of rusty battels and two skeletons near them. He saved the whole Radius! }

{287}{999}{我会去感谢他的。回头见。}

### {290}{}{This is one of the most incredible stories! While traveling around Radius, Cyren bumped into a three-meter tall murderous robot, who was destroying everything in his way. This was some unusual robot - he was repeating that he needs to kill someone named "Sacon", but the flaw in programming made him hostile to everything he sees. Cyren engaged the robot in a deadly fight, ripping off the robot's hand in the process - which didn't stop him, by the way, as the robot continued to fight. It ended only when Cyren took down a huge mountain cliff upon his enemy. As a souvenir, Cyren brought some rusty cogs with him. He will never forget the fading red eye of the robot...}
{290}{}{这是最不可思议的故事之一！在Radius周围旅行时，Cyren撞上了一个三米高的杀人机器人，他正在摧毁一切。这是一个不同寻常的机器人――他重复说他需要杀死一个名叫“萨肯”的人，但编程中的缺陷让他对他看到的一切都充满敌意。赛伦与机器人进行了一场致命的打斗，在打斗过程中扯下了机器人的手――顺便说一句，当机器人继续打斗时，这并没有阻止他。直到居伦从一座巨大的山崖上向他的敌人冲去，这一切才结束。作为纪念，赛伦带来了一些生锈的齿轮。他永远不会忘记机器人逐渐变红的眼睛。。。}
