{100}{}{You see: Murphy, the local mine owner.}
{101}{}{He looks very busy, talking, organizing... Seems to be his state of being.}
{102}{}{}
#float poruke ako dude nije pricao sa Mike-om
{103}{}{Good day to you.}
{104}{}{I'm busy now.}
{105}{}{Sorry I'm busy at the moment.}
{106}{}{No time to talk right now.}
# dude pricao sa mike-om
{107}{}{Hello stranger, I saw you talking with Mike. Did he tell you about the job I'm offering? [You nod.] So you
 know what's the situation with the mine. It has to be cleaned from those rats... I tried to do it myself, but there are too
 many of them. I'll pay you $300 for the job. You want it?}
{108}{}{Sure thing Murphy, I'll come back when it's done.}
{109}{}{Not really interested.}
#dude se vratio ali nije prihvatio posao
{110}{}{Yes, what is it?}
{111}{}{About that job you have. I'll take it.}
{112}{}{Talk to you later.}
#dude prihvatio posao i vraca se
{113}{}{You're back. Is the job done?}
{114}{}{No, still in progress.}
#dude prihvatio i obavio posao
{115}{}{You're back. Is the job done?}
{117}{}{It's done. The mine is clean. All the rats are wiped out.}
#response
{118}{}{Good, here's some money for your efforts. [Gives you the money.] You've done a great job there, stranger.
 Come back anytime, I might have more work for you.}
{119}{}{Bye.}
#
{120}{}{Hi there. What brings you back to our town?}
{121}{}{There are some issues I was asked to discuss with you.}
{122}{}{Just looking around.}
#
{123}{}{OK, please, have a seat. [He gestures.] All right then, tell me about it...}
#
{124}{}{Well... I've just come from Farmers Town, they are very interested to start trading again. As soon as possible,
 they want peace.}
#
{125}{}{Right, but I don't know what it has to do with me. I own the mine, and yes, Miners and Farmers had peace
 once. You know, business was going well... But that story, it just didn't last... They didn't pay us for the coal, our losses
 were increasing and there was no money coming in... Eventually, we had to end the deal and shut down the mine.}
#after 156...
{126}{}{I assure you they are willing to make a compromise. Tell me your terms and I'll go tell them. You have
 nothing to lose, they were very interested in reviving that contract.}
#
{127}{}{Alright then. If they want business again they must pay me $3000 every month with no delay. Otherwise I'm
 gonna tell the sheriff about it, and there will be trouble again. Got that? Then go and tell them.}
#
{128}{}{I'm on it.}
#
{129}{}{I'll come back when I have something better. }
#terms from Miners to Farmers
{130}{}{Have you told Farmers Town my terms?}
#
{131}{}{Well yes, I have... And the terms were not accepted.}
{133}{}{I told them about your terms and they agreed to pay, here's the first payment. [Hand him $3000.]}
{134}{}{Still working on it.}
#terms accepted
{135}{}{Very well, I'm glad they've started thinking straight again. Yet again, you've shown me that you are worth
 something. I've got this metal armor, please, take it as a token of my appreciation. Good luck with your travels.}
{136}{}{So long.}
#terms not accepted
{137}{}{It doesn't matter. I have a very good deal with the south, so I don't need them. I'm going to tell the sheriff
 about this new "situation". So, you can tell your friends to stay away for their own good. Only bullets for them here. As
 for you, I guess $1000 should be enough... Go now, I have to get back to my work.}
{138}{}{I'll be going then.}
#dobro
{139}{}{Good job. Keep it that way.}
{140}{}{Nice to see you again.}
{141}{}{We could use someone like you.}
#lose
{142}{}{Sorry, I'm busy!}
{143}{}{I don't want to talk.}
{144}{}{Leave me to my work!}
#
{145}{}{Well, what about that first payment? I haven't seen anything, yet.}
{146}{}{I'll come back with the money.}
#mine job, more money... intelligence <=7
{147}{}{I want $500 for the job.}
#
{148}{}{No, that's too much for me. How do you think I'm going to pay the workers? I only got $300 and that's it. If I
 were you, I would accept the offer... If you don't need money just walk away and I'll find someone who does.}
{149}{}{Right, I'll be back when the job is done.}
{150}{}{Do it yourself, I'm out of here.}
#mine job, more money... intelligence >7
{151}{}{Can't you pay me $500? It would cover the extra expenses to make sure your mine is safe for the workers.}
#
{152}{}{I don't think it's at all necessary, but if it helps to do a proper job... Why not? You'll get your $500.}
{153}{}{That's all I need to know. I'll be back.}
{154}{}{Let me think about it, I'll get back to you.}
#after 125...
{155}{}{What happened then?}
#
{156}{}{Since then, we stopped trading with them... Years have passed. But recently, with your help I reopened the
 mine because I got a good deal with the south. Having in mind our previous business situation with Farmers Town,
 I don't think I want to remake that contract, they can't be trusted.}
#after 137...
{157}{}{Not so fast, the sheriff doesn't need to know about this. Because you're not going to tell him, right?}
#
{158}{}{If you say so, let me just... close the door...}
{159}{}{Don't worry, I can do that, after I'm done here.}
#after 137...
{160}{}{Can't you reconsider your decision?}
#
{161}{}{Hmm, reconsider, you say? [He pulls out a gun.] Let me think...}
{162}{}{I guess we can think faster now.}
#
{163}{}{That's nice to hear but... aren't you forgetting something? You told me you were going to take care of it...
 that situation in the mine?}
{164}{}{Oh, sorry, I'm on it.}
{165}{}{Find someone else to do your work.}
#
{166}{}{That's nice to hear but... lets talk about the mine situation first, any news?}
#stockman job active, first visit
{167}{}{Hello there stranger. What can Murphy do for you?}
#stockman job active, mine work not active
{168}{}{Those matters will have to wait because we have a serious situation down in the mine. Please don't bother me
 right now.}
#stockman job active
{169}{}{Nevermind that, we have a difficult situation in the mine. It has to be cleaned from those damn rats... I tried to
 do it myself, but there are too many of them. I'll pay you $300 for the job. You want it?}
#
{170}{}{Thanks, can we talk about Farmers now?}
{171}{}{I wanted to discuss business again.}
