#{100}{}{You see a ghoul.}
{100}{}{你看到一个僵尸。}
#{150}{}{You see Chris.}
{150}{}{你看到克里斯了。}
#{200}{}{You see a ghoul who is tinkering with a disassembled laser rifle.}
{200}{}{你看到一个僵尸正在修补一把拆下来的激光步枪。}
#{250}{}{You see Chris, he's got a disassembled weapon in front of him, as always, and he's doing something with it using some delicate instruments.}
{250}{}{你看克里斯，他面前总是有一把拆下来的武器，他正在用一些精致的仪器做一些事情。}
#{251}{}{You see Chris, it seems that he's not as good at using weapons as he is at repairing them.}
{251}{}{你看克里斯，他似乎不像修理武器那样擅长使用武器。}
#{300}{}{A problem, again.}
{300}{}{又是个问题。}
#{301}{}{Just connect this.}
{301}{}{把这个接上。}
#{302}{}{Interesting, for real.}
{302}{}{真的很有趣。}
#{303}{}{Let's see what would happen if... Dammit!}
{303}{}{让我们看看如果。。。该死！}
#{304}{}{Good, everything works, cool.}
{304}{}{很好，一切正常，酷。}
#{305}{}{Damn lens, I really don't like it.}
{305}{}{该死的镜头，我真的不喜欢。}
#{306}{}{Not a scratch, I hope.}
{306}{}{希望不是擦伤。}
#{307}{}{Dammit, I better check it out once again.}
{307}{}{该死，我最好再查一遍。}
#{308}{}{It should... What is this?!}
{308}{}{它应该。。。这是什么？！}
#{500}{}{Look, do you see that? [He points at a disassembled weapon on a table.] Laser rifle, type Wattz 2000, it shoots separated pulses of powerful laser rays. A single ray like that can cut a man in half. Pew and it's done!}
{500}{}{你看到了吗？[他指着桌子上一把拆卸下来的武器]激光步枪，型号为Wattz 2000，它能发射分离的强大激光脉冲。像这样的一条射线可以把人切成两半。皮尤，一切都结束了！}
#{501}{}{It certainly is interesting, but...}
{501}{}{这当然很有趣，但是。。。}
#{502}{}{Wat?}
{502}{}{什么？}
#{550}{}{Exactly! This one doesn't work and I can't figure out what the problem is! It doesn't react at all. I checked all the circuits that are responsible for drawing energy from microfusion cells, but they're OK. This damn piece of crap should shoot!}
{550}{}{确切地！这个不行，我也搞不清楚是什么问题！它完全没有反应。我检查了所有负责从微融合细胞中提取能量的电路，但它们都正常。这该死的东西应该开枪！}
#{551}{}{Maybe the trigger isn't working. Sometimes that happens with this type of laser rifle, but it's difficult to figure it out if something like that never happen to you before.}
{551}{}{可能是扳机坏了。这种类型的激光步枪有时会发生这种情况，但很难判断以前是否从未发生过类似的事情。}
#{552}{}{I want to talk to you!}
{552}{}{我想和你谈谈！}
#{553}{}{Ugh uff!}
{553}{}{啊，该死！}
#{600}{}{Hey, hold on a second! [He tinkers with the weapon for a while.] Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit, you're right. Stupid me, for half a day I'm running tests on the most difficult circuits. Now I'll be able to fix it in a minute, this beauty will soon be cutting in half whatever the owner would like to cut in half. You're good, I must admit that.}
{600}{}{嘿，等一下！[他摆弄了一会儿武器]好吧，拍我的屁股，叫我饼干，你说得对。愚蠢的我，半天来我都在测试最难的电路。现在我马上就能修好了，这个美人很快就会把主人想要的东西切成两半。你很好，我必须承认。}
#{601}{}{Thanks.}
{601}{}{谢谢。}
#{650}{}{So I'll be busy with it for another couple of hours, and if I'm not any wiser by then, I'll be really really pissed. I'll take...}
{650}{}{所以我还要忙上几个小时，如果到那时我还不明白的话，我真的会很生气的。我要。。。}
#{651}{}{Hey!}
{651}{}{嘿！}
#{700}{}{What? Ah, I see, do you need something? I'm in charge of weaponry. I produce, repair, maintain and all that kind of stuff, but that's probably why you're here, right? So... Well, my name's Chris, I think I haven't mentioned that yet.}
{700}{}{什么？啊，我明白了，你需要什么吗？我负责武器。我生产，修理，保养之类的东西，但这可能就是你来这里的原因，对吧？所以。。。嗯，我的名字叫克里斯，我想我还没提到。}
#{701}{}{I want to talk to you.}
{701}{}{我想和你谈谈。}
#{702}{}{I'm bringing you blueprints of a Gauss rifle from Feargus, you're supposed to use them to produce one.}
{702}{}{我给你带来了费尔格斯的高斯步枪的设计图，你应该用它们来生产一把。}
#{703}{}{I don't think I need anything from you. Goodbye.}
{703}{}{我想我不需要你的任何东西。再见。}
#{750}{}{But not as good as me! My name's Chris, I'm in charge of weaponry. I repair, maintain, produce and so on. Doing all that I've picked up a couple of tricks that can help me upgrade energy weapons. You can't do it, and you want to know these tricks, am I right?}
{750}{}{但没有我好！我叫克里斯，负责武器。我修理，保养，生产等等。做了这些，我学会了一些技巧，可以帮助我升级能量武器。你做不到，你想知道这些把戏，对吗？}
#{751}{}{Yeah, I'm interested.}
{751}{}{是的，我很感兴趣。}
#{752}{}{You'll have to tell me another time.}
{752}{}{你下次再告诉我。}
#{800}{}{I found a... Wait, what? You don't want to hear it now? But... but it's really interesting. So, what do you want here?}
{800}{}{我找到一个。。。等等，什么？你现在不想听吗？但是。。。但真的很有趣。那么，你想要什么？}
#{801}{}{All right, if it's so interesting, tell me.}
{801}{}{好吧，如果有意思的话，告诉我。}
#{802}{}{I want to talk to you.}
{802}{}{我想和你谈谈。}
#{803}{}{I'm bringing you blueprints of a Gauss rifle from Feargus, you're supposed to use them to produce one.}
{803}{}{我给你带来了费尔格斯的高斯步枪的设计图，你应该用它们来生产一把。}
#{804}{}{I don't want anything from you, goodbye.}
{804}{}{我不想要你的任何东西，再见。}
#{850}{}{I found a way to connect a three-step plasma transformer, an amazing component, really, to the system of energy consumption from energy cells, so the consumption is smaller but with same outcome, or the outcome is bigger with the same consumption. Wicked, huh?!}
{850}{}{我找到了一种方法，把一个三级等离子变压器，一个神奇的组件，连接到能量电池的能量消耗系统，所以消耗量较小，但结果相同，或者消耗量较大。邪恶，哈？！}
#{851}{}{Interesting, so can you upgrade some weapons for me?}
{851}{}{有意思，你能帮我升级一些武器吗？}
#{900}{}{I could! But I don't have any plasma transformers. There aren't a lot of them, and on top of that, Feargus doesn't like to see me doing these upgrades. After all, those weapons aren't really built for such manipulations. But I've never gotten a single problem! When I get a hold of a plasma transformer, I'll be able to upgrade any common weapon that uses some kind of energy cells for you, and I'll bet you anything that it'll be as durable as any non-upgraded weapon!}
{900}{}{我可以！但我没有等离子变压器。它们并不多，除此之外，费格斯不喜欢看到我做这些升级。毕竟，这些武器并不是为这种操纵而制造的。但我从来没有遇到过一个问题！当我得到一个等离子变压器，我就可以升级任何使用某种能量电池的普通武器，我敢打赌它会像任何未升级的武器一样耐用！}
#{901}{}{Where can I get a plasma transformer?}
{901}{}{我在哪能买到等离子变压器？}
#{902}{}{That's a funny coincidence, I've got a plasma transformer with me, so can you upgrade a weapon for me?}
{902}{}{这是个有趣的巧合，我带了一个等离子变压器，你能帮我升级一个武器吗？}
#{903}{}{What about upgrading small and heavy weapons?}
{903}{}{升级小型和重型武器怎么样？}
#{904}{}{Cool. Can we talk some more?}
{904}{}{很酷。我们能再谈谈吗？}
#{905}{}{Oh, before I forget, I'm bringing you blueprints of a Gauss rifle from Feargus, you're supposed to use them to produce one.}
{905}{}{哦，在我忘记之前，我给你带来了费尔格斯的高斯步枪的设计图，你应该用它们来生产一支。}
#{906}{}{I see. Take care.}
{906}{}{我懂了。当心。}
#{950}{}{They probably hide a few of them on fifth level, but it's more likely that some'll fall from the sky than you getting one from there.}
{950}{}{他们可能在第五层藏了一些，但更有可能从天上掉下来，而不是从那里得到一个。}
#{951}{}{That's a funny coincidence, I've got a plasma transformer with me, so can you upgrade a weapon for me?}
{951}{}{这是个有趣的巧合，我带了一个等离子变压器，你能帮我升级一个武器吗？}
#{952}{}{What about upgrading small and heavy weapons?}
{952}{}{升级小型和重型武器怎么样？}
#{953}{}{Cool. Can we talk some more?}
{953}{}{很酷。我们能再谈谈吗？}
#{954}{}{Oh, before I forget, I'm bringing you blueprints of a Gauss rifle from Feargus, you're supposed to use them to produce one.}
{954}{}{哦，在我忘记之前，我给你带来了费尔格斯的高斯步枪的设计图，你应该用它们来生产一支。}
#{955}{}{I see. Take care.}
{955}{}{我懂了。当心。}
#{1000}{}{Just to talk? Well I don't have time for that, for real; do you know how much work I've got left to do? I won't even try to list you it all. Just look here, for instance, ten plasma pistols. I've got to clean them all. It's slow, rigorous work, just one small mistake and BOOM! It'll explode in someone's hand, you know.}
{1000}{}{只是想谈谈？我真的没有时间做那件事，你知道我还有多少工作要做吗？我甚至不想把这些都列出来。看看这里，比如说，十把等离子手枪。我得把它们都洗干净。这是一个缓慢，严谨的工作，只是一个小错误和繁荣！它会在别人手里爆炸的，你知道的。}
#{1001}{}{So, tell me about the weapon upgrades.}
{1001}{}{告诉我武器升级的事。}
#{1002}{}{I've got a plasma transformer with me, so can you upgrade a weapon for me?}
{1002}{}{我带了一个等离子变压器，你能帮我升级武器吗？}
#{1003}{}{And I've got some more work for you. Here are the blueprints of a Gauss rifle from Feargus, you're supposed to use them to produce one.}
{1003}{}{我还有工作要做。这是费尔格斯的高斯步枪的设计图，你应该用它来生产一支。}
#{1004}{}{I see, I let you work then.}
{1004}{}{我明白了，那我就让你工作了。}
#{1050}{}{[He tinkers with some energy pistol.] Well, just this contact... Slowly... What?! Shit, now I missed it because of you. Do you need something?}
{1050}{}{[他摆弄了一把能量手枪]好吧，就这个接触。。。慢慢地。。。什么？！妈的，现在因为你我错过了。你需要什么吗？}
#{1054}{}{Be careful with connecting those contacts. If you scratch the circuit too much, the pistol could melt itself down instead of shooting, and take the shooters hand as collateral damage.}
{1054}{}{小心连接这些触点。如果你刮伤电路太多，手枪可能会融化自己，而不是射击，并采取枪手的手作为附带损害。}
#{1051}{}{I'm bringing you blueprints of a Gauss rifle from Feargus, you're supposed to use them to produce one.}
{1051}{}{我给你带来了费尔格斯的高斯步枪的设计图，你应该用它们来生产一把。}
#{1052}{}{I don't need anything, I just want to chat.}
{1052}{}{我什么都不需要，我只是想聊聊天。}
#{1053}{}{Not really, I'm sorry.}
{1053}{}{不是真的，对不起。}
#{1100}{}{I'll connect it with microfusion cells instead of small energy cells and we'll see if it'll increase power output. Hopefully it won't explode, since I've connected... Who's that?! Oh, hi man, I'm trying some new stuff, you know. But don't say anything to Feargus.}
{1100}{}{我会把它和微融合细胞而不是小能量细胞连接起来，看看它是否能增加能量输出。希望它不会爆炸，因为我已经连接。。。那是谁？！哦，嗨，伙计，我在尝试一些新东西，你知道的。但别跟费格斯说什么。}
#{1101}{}{Tell me about the weapon upgrades.}
{1101}{}{告诉我武器升级的事。}
#{1102}{}{I've got a plasma transformer with me, so can you upgrade a weapon for me?}
{1102}{}{我带了一个等离子变压器，你能帮我升级武器吗？}

#{1104}{}{What about a little chat?}
{1104}{}{聊聊天怎么样？}
#{1105}{}{I won't disturb you, bye.}
{1105}{}{我不会打扰你的，再见。}
#{1150}{}{You've got a plasma transformer? You've really got a plasma transformer?! That's great that you have one! Of course I'll upgrade you something. Give me a weapon then, so I can do my thing. I'll be finished within an hour, surprised, are you?}
{1150}{}{你有等离子变压器吗？你真的有等离子变压器？！你有一个真是太好了！我当然会给你升级的。那就给我武器，这样我就能做我该做的事了。我一小时内就做完了，你很惊讶吧？}
#{1151}{}{Here you go, a power fist.}
{1151}{}{给你，一个有力的拳头。}
#{1152}{}{Here you go, a laser pistol.}
{1152}{}{给你，激光手枪。}

#{1156}{}{Here you go, a cattle prod.}
{1156}{}{给你，一根牛鞭。}
#{1157}{}{Forget it, I'll bring you a weapon some other time.}
{1157}{}{算了吧，改天我给你带武器。}
#{1200}{}{Done, such perfect work, I'm telling you. I upgraded the efficiency, it's really something.}
{1200}{}{我告诉你，干得真好。我提高了效率，真是了不起。}
#{1201}{}{I've got one more plasma transformer.}
{1201}{}{我还有一个等离子变压器。}
#{1202}{}{Thanks, bye.}
{1202}{}{谢谢，再见。}
#{1250}{}{Done, such perfect work, I'm telling you. Magazine capacity is doubled, it may come in handy, yeah.}
{1250}{}{我告诉你，干得真好。杂志容量增加了一倍，也许会派上用场。}
#{1251}{}{I've got one more plasma transformer.}
{1251}{}{我还有一个等离子变压器。}
#{1252}{}{Thanks, bye.}
{1252}{}{谢谢，再见。}
#{1300}{}{You've got another plasma transformer? You've really got another plasma transformer?! That's great! That's unbelievable! Give me another weapon to play with.}
{1300}{}{你有另一个等离子变压器吗？你真的有另一个等离子变压器？！太好了！太不可思议了！再给我一件武器玩。}
#{1301}{}{Here you go, a power fist.}

{1307}{}{算了吧，改天我给你带武器。}
#{1350}{}{Well fuck me sideways, he finally finished it! Best news in quite a long time, I'll start immediately and I won't stop until I finish it. It'll be done tomorrow, I'm telling you. Just come and see.}
{1350}{}{他妈的，他终于完成了！很长一段时间以来最好的消息，我会立即开始，直到我完成它我不会停止。我告诉你，明天就好了。过来看看。}
#{1351}{}{OK, maybe I will.}
{1351}{}{好吧，也许我会的。}
#{1400}{}{Not now, just leave it here, whatever it is, I've got a lot of work to do... Oh, it's you! Well I'm working on it, the rifle isn't finished yet. So stop hindering me, will you?}
{1400}{}{不是现在，把它留在这里，不管是什么，我有很多工作要做。。。哦，是你！我正在努力，步枪还没完成。别再妨碍我了，好吗？}
#{1401}{}{OK.}
{1401}{}{好 啊。}
#{1402}{}{Ugh.}
{1402}{}{啊。}
#{1450}{}{What? Well, you're here, finally! It's finished, look! [He takes a new rifle in his hand.] Beautiful, isn't it? Amazing range and accuracy, and the muzzle velocity is almost half the speed of light. That's something, a projectile from this toy would fly through power armor like it's butter. I made five cartridges, we don't need more to test it. Five's a full magazine for this gun, anyway. [He puts it in your hand.] Here, give it a try in the nearby shooting range. Make at least 4 hits to the robots, the computer will analyze the effectiveness.}
{1450}{}{什么？你终于来了！完成了，看！[他手里拿着一把新来复枪]很漂亮，不是吗？惊人的射程和精度，炮口的初速几乎是光速的一半。这东西，一个从这个玩具发射的炮弹会像黄油一样穿过动力装甲。我做了五个子弹，不用再测试了。不管怎么说，这把枪的弹匣已经满了。[他把它放在你手里]来，在附近的射击场试一试。对机器人至少打4下，计算机将分析其有效性。}
#{1451}{}{OK.}
{1451}{}{好 啊。}
#{1452}{}{Oh-kay.}
{1452}{}{哦，凯。}
#{1500}{}{So what do you say? About the Gauss rifle! Have you tried it? You surely have, I myself am really nervous about how it's going to work.}
{1500}{}{那你怎么说？关于高斯步枪！你试过了吗？你当然有，我自己也很担心它会如何运作。}
#{1501}{}{It works without a problem, and it's just as you said - perfect.}
{1501}{}{它工作没有问题，就像你说的-完美。}
#{1502}{}{I've got a plasma transformer with me, so can you upgrade a weapon for me?}
{1502}{}{我带了一个等离子变压器，你能帮我升级武器吗？}
#{1503}{}{I haven't tried it yet.}
{1503}{}{我还没试过呢。}
#{1504}{}{Yeah.}
{1504}{}{是 啊。}
#{1505}{}{No-no.}
{1505}{}{不，不。}
#{1506}{}{I've tried it, but I guess it's not enough. You said you needed 4 hits?}
{1506}{}{我试过了，但我想还不够。你说你需要4支安打？}
#{1507}{}{I'm working on it.}
{1507}{}{我正在努力。}
#{1550}{}{Yeah! [He quickly approaches the computer and observes the analysis of the rifle's effectiveness, based on your test at the shooting rage.] Perfect! I knew it, hell yeah! The only drawback is the small magazine size, but since we now know that the rifle works absolutely flawlessly, I'm sure that Feargus will fix it. I hope they authorize them and we'll begin to produce them for our soldiers, that would be something. But for now, this one must go to the storeroom, well, I'd like to try it, but I can't. Just to be sure, I made another 20 rounds, if further tests are needed, so here you go. Take the rifle to Dave in the storeroom, he'll store it safely. Probably in a way that nobody will ever find it again, haha... Ehm.}
{1550}{}{是 啊！[他迅速接近电脑，根据你在射击狂怒时的测试，观察对步枪有效性的分析。]太好了！我就知道，是啊！唯一的缺点是弹匣尺寸小，但既然我们现在知道步枪的工作绝对完美无瑕，我相信费格斯会修好的。我希望他们批准他们，我们将开始生产他们为我们的士兵，这将是一些东西。但是现在，这个必须去储藏室，好吧，我想试试，但是我不能。只是确定一下，我又做了20轮，如果需要进一步的测试，那就给你。把枪带到储藏室给戴夫，他会安全地存放的。也许在某种程度上没人会再找到它，哈哈。。。嗯。}
#{1551}{}{OK.}
{1551}{}{好 啊。}
#{1552}{}{Oh-kay.}
{1552}{}{哦，凯。}
#{1600}{}{What are you waiting for?! How can you... I don't get it. You know how much of a headway this rifle is. Dammit, if only I didn't have so much work. You've got no idea, how nervous I am about it.}
{1600}{}{你在等什么？！你怎么能。。。我不明白。你知道这把步枪有多大的进步。该死，要是我没有那么多工作就好了。你不知道，我有多紧张。}
#{1601}{}{OK, just take it easy.}
{1601}{}{好吧，别紧张。}
#{1602}{}{Chrisie easy.}
{1602}{}{克丽丝，别紧张。}
#{1650}{}{Now?! I'm on pins and needles, dude! I can't focus until you try that rifle!}
{1650}{}{现在？！我坐立不安，伙计！你不试试那把枪我就不能集中注意力！}
#{1651}{}{OK, just take it easy.}
{1651}{}{好吧，别紧张。}
#{1700}{}{I've just heard from Dave that you didn't bring him that Gauss rifle. This can't be! I know, sometimes these rules can be a pain in the ass, but this really can't be, and I mean it! You better give it to me, I'll take it to him. Immediately, that's right.}
{1700}{}{我刚听戴夫说你没给他带高斯步枪。这不可能！我知道，有时候这些规则会让人头疼，但这真的不可能，我是认真的！你最好把它给我，我把它带给他。马上，没错。}
#{1701}{}{Here you go.}
{1701}{}{干得好。}
#{1702}{}{I'm not giving you the rifle.}
{1702}{}{我不会把枪给你的。}
#{1703}{}{Huh. [Give him what he wants.]}
{1703}{}{呵呵。[给他想要的。]}
#{1704}{}{No-no.}
{1704}{}{不，不。}
#{1750}{}{Well, and why was it such a problem to give it to Dave? I really don't get it. So now I have to waste my time, and what's more, I don't feel like giving it to him. Dammit, you better leave.}
{1750}{}{那么，为什么给戴夫这么麻烦呢？我真的不明白。所以现在我不得不浪费时间，更重要的是，我不想把时间给他。该死，你最好离开。}
#{1751}{}{OK.}
{1751}{}{好 啊。}
#{1752}{}{Oh-kay.}
{1752}{}{哦，凯。}
#{1800}{}{What do you mean not giving me the rifle?! Well, but... That... You know. OK then, but I've got to start the alarm, look. [He starts the alarm.]}
{1800}{}{你不把枪给我是什么意思？！好吧，但是。。。那个。。。你知道的。好吧，但我得启动闹钟了，看。[他启动了警报。]}
#{1801}{}{You're going to regret it.}
{1801}{}{你会后悔的。}
#{1802}{}{Grr.}
{1802}{}{Grr公司。}
#{1850}{}{What? What?! Oh my, what do you want here? I'm Chris, I'm in charge of the weaponry, you didn't come to see me, am I right? Yeah, I don't think you did.}
{1850}{}{什么？什么？！哦，天哪，你想在这里干什么？我是克里斯，我负责武器，你不是来看我的吧？是的，我想你没有。}
#{1851}{}{Uh-uh.}
{1851}{}{呃，呃。}
#{1900}{}{I'll never figure out this bullshit, I checked it like a thousand times and there's... Oh! It's you... But you should let me work, seriously.}
{1900}{}{我永远也搞不懂这些胡说八道，我查了一千遍，发现。。。哦！是你。。。但你应该让我工作，说真的。}
#{1901}{}{Ugh.}
{1901}{}{啊。}
#{1950}{}{Hey, hold on a second! [He tinkers with the weapon for a while.] Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit, you're right. Stupid me, for half a day I'm running tests on the most difficult circuits. Now I'll be able to fix it in a minute, this beauty will soon be cutting in half whatever the owner would like to cut in half. You're good, I'll give you that.}
{1950}{}{嘿，等一下！[他摆弄了一会儿武器]好吧，拍我的屁股，叫我饼干，你说得对。愚蠢的我，半天来我都在测试最难的电路。现在我马上就能修好了，这个美人很快就会把主人想要的东西切成两半。你很好，我会给你的。}

{1951}{}{谢谢。}
#{2000}{}{But not as good as me! My name's Chris, I'm in charge of weaponry. I repair, maintain, produce and so on. Doing all that I've picked up a couple of tricks that can help me upgrade energy weapons. You can't do it and you want to know these tricks, am I right?}

#{2100}{}{So what do you say? About the Gauss rifle! Have you tried it? You surely have, I myself am really nervous about how it's going to work.}
{2100}{}{那你怎么说？关于高斯步枪！你试过了吗？你当然有，我自己也很担心它会如何运作。}
#{2101}{}{It works without a problem, and it's just as you said - perfect.}
{2101}{}{它工作没有问题，就像你说的-完美。}
#{2102}{}{I've got a plasma transformer with me, so can you upgrade a weapon for me?}
{2102}{}{我带了一个等离子变压器，你能帮我升级武器吗？}
#{2103}{}{I haven't tried it yet.}
{2103}{}{我还没试过呢。}
#{2104}{}{Yeah.}
{2104}{}{是 啊。}
#{2105}{}{No-no.}
{2105}{}{不，不。}
#{2106}{}{I've tried it, but I guess it's not enough. You said you needed 4 hits?}
{2106}{}{我试过了，但我想还不够。你说你需要4支安打？}
#{2107}{}{I'm working on it.}
{2107}{}{我正在努力。}
#{2150}{}{I've just heard from Dave that you didn't bring him that Gauss rifle. This can't be! I know, sometimes these rules can be a pain in the ass, but this really can't be, and I mean it! You better give it to me, I'll take it to him. Immediately, that's right.}
{2150}{}{我刚听戴夫说你没给他带高斯步枪。这不可能！我知道，有时候这些规则会让人头疼，但这真的不可能，我是认真的！你最好把它给我，我把它带给他。马上，没错。}
#{2151}{}{Here you go.}
{2151}{}{干得好。}
#{2152}{}{I'm not giving you the rifle.}
{2152}{}{我不会把枪给你的。}
#{2153}{}{Huh. [Give him what he wants.]}
{2153}{}{呵呵。[给他想要的。]}
#{2154}{}{No-no.}
{2154}{}{不，不。}
#{2200}{}{What? What?! Oh my, what do you want here? I'm Chris, I'm in charge of the weaponry, you didn't come to see me, am I right? Yeah, I don't think you did.}
{2200}{}{什么？什么？！哦，天哪，你想在这里干什么？我是克里斯，我负责武器，你不是来看我的吧？是的，我想你没有。}
#{2201}{}{Uh-uh.}
{2201}{}{呃，呃。}
#{2250}{}{I'll never figure out this bullshit, I checked it like a thousand times and there's... Oh! It's you... But you should let me work, seriously.}
{2250}{}{我永远也搞不懂这些胡说八道，我查了一千遍，发现。。。哦！是你。。。但你应该让我工作，说真的。}
#{2251}{}{Ugh.}
{2251}{}{啊。}
#{2300}{}{That? Well that's easy. I've got a Mr. Handy, which I upgraded to make such modifications. I'm sorry but I don't have time to occupy myself with something like that, I really don't. And I can't let you handle it, you need some technical skills about weaponry to manipulate with it, you'd break it otherwise. No, no, I'm the only one allowed to work with it, me and a couple of other people, whom I can more or less rely on.}
{2300}{}{那个？那很简单。我有一个汉迪先生，我升级了它来做这样的修改。我很抱歉，我没有时间来处理这样的事情，我真的没有。我不能让你处理它，你需要一些武器技术来操纵它，否则你会弄坏它。不，不，我是唯一一个被允许和它一起工作的人，我和其他几个人，我或多或少可以依赖他们。}
#{2301}{}{That? Well that's easy. I've got a Mr. Handy, which I upgraded to make such modifications. I'm sorry but I don't have time to occupy myself with something like that, I really don't.

#{2302}{}{OK, back to energy weapons. I've actually got a plasma transformer with me, so can you upgrade a weapon for me?}
{2302}{}{好，回到能量武器。我带了一个等离子变压器，你能帮我升级武器吗？}
#{2303}{}{OK. Can we talk some more?}
{2303}{}{好 啊。我们能再谈谈吗？}
#{2304}{}{I see. Oh, before I forget, I'm bringing you blueprints of a Gauss rifle from Feargus, you're supposed to use them to produce one.}
{2304}{}{我懂了。哦，在我忘记之前，我给你带来了费尔格斯的高斯步枪的设计图，你应该用它们来生产一支。}
#{2305}{}{I see. Take care.}
{2305}{}{我懂了。当心。}
#{2350}{}{Well of course, I know that, it's not the first pistol I've repaired. I've been doing this for quite a long time, I've picked up a couple of tricks that can help me upgrade energy weapons. You can't do it and you want to know these tricks, am I right?}
{2350}{}{当然，我知道，这不是我修的第一把手枪。我已经做了很长时间了，我学会了一些技巧，可以帮助我升级能量武器。你不能这么做，你想知道这些把戏，对吗？}
#{2351}{}{Yeah, I'm interested.}
{2351}{}{是的，我很感兴趣。}
#{2352}{}{You'll have to tell me another time.}
{2352}{}{你下次再告诉我。}
#{2400}{}{I've just heard from Dave that he got the gauss rifle. Thank you, I'm really busy and even a little help is appreciated. I don't even have time to try my own improvements! I found a way to connect a three-step plasma transformer, an amazing component, really, to the system of energy consumption from energy cells, so the consumption is smaller but with same outcome, or the outcome is bigger with the same consumption. Wicked, huh?!}
{2400}{}{我刚听戴夫说他有高斯步枪。谢谢你，我真的很忙，哪怕是一点点帮助都很感激。我甚至没有时间尝试我自己的改进！我找到了一种方法，把一个三级等离子变压器，一个神奇的组件，连接到能量电池的能量消耗系统，所以消耗量较小，但结果相同，或者消耗量较大。邪恶，哈？！}
#{2401}{}{Interesting, so can you upgrade some weapons for me?}
{2401}{}{有意思，你能帮我升级一些武器吗？}
#{2450}{}{What do you mean by that? I don't understand you at all. Are you trying to tell me that you can't hit motionless robots on the shooting range? Well, that would be nonsense, I refuse to listen to that. Go back to the shooting range and finish the testing. I'm really curious about how that gun will perform. So get moving, will you?}
{2450}{}{你这是什么意思？我一点也不理解你。你是想告诉我你不能打靶场上静止的机器人吗？好吧，那是胡说八道，我拒绝听。回到射击场完成测试。我真的很好奇那把枪的性能。那就行动起来，好吗？}
#{2451}{}{It's a prototype of a new, atypical rifle. You should understand that it requires some practice before you get used to it. I hope we won't abandon the testing just because I missed a few shots.}
{2451}{}{这是一种新型非典型步枪的原型。你应该明白在你习惯它之前需要一些练习。我希望我们不会因为错过几枪就放弃测试。}
#{2452}{}{It's a prototype of a new, atypical rifle. You should understand that it requires some practice before you get used to it. I hope we won't abandon the testing just because I missed a few shots.}
{2452}{}{这是一种新型非典型步枪的原型。你应该明白在你习惯它之前需要一些练习。我希望我们不会因为错过几枪就放弃测试。}
#{2453}{}{OK, if that's what you think.}
{2453}{}{好吧，如果你是这么想的。}
#{2500}{}{Fine, fine! It's good that I made a few more rounds, so you can reload the rifle. No... I'd rather do it myself. Give it to me, come on...}
{2500}{}{很好，很好！还好我多打了几枪，这样你就可以重新装枪了。不。。。我宁愿自己做。把它给我，来吧。。。}
#{2501}{}{[Give him the Gauss rifle.]}
{2501}{}{[把高斯步枪给他。]}
#{2550}{}{[He eagerly takes the rifle from you and skillfully reloads the magazine. Then he tries the grip on the gun-stock.] I think it's OK. So don't screw it up again, I can't keep constantly making new rounds. If you can't do it, somebody else will have to. We need only four hits for the computer to analyze it. [He gives you the rifle back.] Well... What are you waiting for?}
{2550}{}{[他迫不及待地从你手中接过步枪，熟练地重新装好弹匣。然后他试着抓住枪托。]我想没关系。所以别再搞砸了，我不能一直打新的回合。如果你做不到，就得有人去做。我们只需要点击四下电脑就能分析出来。[他把枪还给你]好吧。。。你在等什么？}
#{2551}{}{Thanks, and don't worry, I'm on it.}
{2551}{}{谢谢，别担心，我会的。}
