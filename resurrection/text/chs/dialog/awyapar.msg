#{1800}{}{[Colonel Parson leisurely copies the contents of the holodisk to his computer and quickly goes through it. He reads a few randomly selected passages carefully.] I had a hunch that the Hunters were neglecting their duties. The fact that they let atrocities of this scale be organized in Albuquerque only proves me right. Very well, have it your way. I will send an assault team to join the attack. It will be small to avoid drawing unnecessary attention, but sufficient for the task. And if one of the Hunters tries to complain about the presence of our soldiers in the Dead Quarter anyway, I will personally shut him up by ramming this holodisk into his mouth.}
{1800}{}{[帕森上校悠闲地把全息光盘的内容复制到他的电脑上，然后迅速地浏览。他仔细阅读了随机挑选的几段文字]我预感到猎人们在玩忽职守。他们让这种规模的暴行在阿尔伯克基组织起来的事实只能证明我是对的。好吧，随你的便。我会派出突击队加入攻击。它将很小，以避免引起不必要的注意，但足以完成任务。如果其中一个猎人试图抱怨我们的士兵在死区，我会亲自把这个全息光盘塞进他的嘴里，让他闭嘴。}

#{10006}{}{I... I confess. It's all true.}
{10006}{}{一、 。。。我承认。都是真的。}
#{10007}{}{But I'd never do anything that would harm the army! I never falsified the tests. They were all kids that wouldn't have been accepted. They were of no use anyway.}

{10011}{}{你做得对。我认为这件事已经了结了。扎卡里・布劳曼将作为一名优秀的士兵被人们铭记。}
