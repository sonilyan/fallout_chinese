{10}{}{Welcome to "Olympus 2207"!}
{11}{}{If you are playing the game for the first time, we strongly recommend that you enable hints.}
{12}{}{Do you want to get hints during gameplay?}
{13}{}{}
{14}{}{}
{15}{}{You have completed enough tasks to move on to the next part of the game. To do this, "use" your bed on the first level.}
{16}{}{You have completed all the tasks and can now move on to the next part of the game. To do this, "use" your bed on the first level.}
{17}{}{You have received your first item assembling task. To access the build panel, click on the "-HMS-" icon on the right side of the interface panel (see figure below) and follow the instructions. To gain access to the collection of other items, your hero must learn about the possibility of assembling them.}
{18}{}{To repair the fuse box, you can apply the "science" skill to it and fix it manually. Also, you can hack electronic locks, after opening their electric panel with a screwdriver.}
{19}{}{Be careful when trying to steal from someone, because in case of your "steal" skill being too low, there is a 25% chance that the victim will notice your malicious intentions and attack you! Keep in mind that to steal from merchants, your skill must be around at least 100-120%.}
{20}{}{By killing someone, you not only increase your kill count but also change your karma! Be extremely careful shooting the next person between the eyes, because if he turns out to be a character vital to the plot, you will have to pave the way through a mountain of corpses!}
{21}{}{When solving the tasks you face, remember that each decision you make affects your karma and the attitude of individual characters and entire locations towards you. The level of your karma depends on the options for lines available in dialogues, options for solving quests, and even the availability of quests.}
{22}{}{Fixing a sparking fuse box is a complicated and unsafe task! If your "Repair" skill is high enough, you can try to use it for repairs. If you doubt your repair abilities use the "Science" skill and try your luck with your hands and wits. Or if you have a silver tongue, you can just ask someone else to fix the fuse box for you. For example, Smitty at the Maintenance level.}
{23}{}{You must go down to the Farms and get a list of the daily tasks from the Herald. To move between the floors of Tartarus, "use" the passageways/stairs behind the guards.}
{24}{}{RADIATION! Monitor your body's radiation levels using the "Rad-O-Meter" or the accumulated radiation messages in the information display on the left side of the control panel. If you have accumulated more than 300 rad, your Strength and Agility will decrease. Even after cleansing the body of radiation, it will take another couple of days for these stats to recover. If you accumulate more than 400-500 rad, you risk losing health points, also, your reduced stats might not recover. If you do not want to suffer from radiation - set the difficulty of the game to "easy" right now.}
{25}{}{Anderson is dead. Standing over the body of a defeated enemy, you look back at your long and difficult journey from a naive Servant to the conqueror of Olympus who defeated its "God". You are the first to reach the end of this path - and you are the first to be presented with the toughest choice. To take the highest power, the responsibility for mankind's survival, making the ultimate sacrifice in the hope to make things better - or to completely forfeit the vicious cycle, and let the inhabitants of Olympus create their destiny with their own will, choices, and mistakes.                                                        The fate of the whole Radius is in your hands.                                    Will you take Anderson's place as the head of Olympus?}
{26}{}{If this is not the first time you have decided to explore the world of "Olympus 2207", you can skip the initial stages of the game in Tartarus right now. This resolves all skipped quests at the lower end of possible experience points, with every outcome being neutral by default. Do you want to skip the initial stages of Tartarus?}
{27}{}{As the game progresses, you will encounter a large number of different items. The most important and interesting ones are marked with a * in the title. If you find such an item, hold on to it! Most likely it is an important part of a quest or the key to some amazing place in the game world!}
{28}{}{Your current resolution is too small to play the game comfortably. If you continue, you'll encounter problems, crashes and generally bad impression about everything. It is recommended to use resolution not less than 800x600 (and if you use "x2 Scaling", then 1600x1050).                                                                                                                               Press "Yes" to continue with the current resolution. "Close" to return to main menu.}
