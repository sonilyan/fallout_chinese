#{100}{}{You see Tony.}
{100}{}{你看到托尼了。}
#{101}{}{You see on of the Nelson's men. And he's clearly in a bad shape.}
{101}{}{你看到尼尔森手下的人。很明显他身体不好。}
#{102}{}{You see on of the Nelson's men.}
{102}{}{你看到尼尔森手下的人。}
#{103}{}{  }
{103}{}{  }
#{110}{}{*Heavy coughs gushing around*}
{110}{}{*剧烈咳嗽*}
#{111}{}{The sick one is not quite sure about your actions.}
{111}{}{那个病人对你的行为不太清楚。}
#{112}{}{Do you even know what are you doing?}
{112}{}{你知道你在干什么吗？}
#{113}{}{Hey doc, I've never felt better! Thank you, goddammit. When I stand on my feet, the first thing I'll do is drink booze 'til I fall down again!}
{113}{}{嘿，医生，我感觉从来没有这么好过！谢谢你，该死的。当我站起来的时候，我要做的第一件事就是喝酒，直到我再次倒下！}
#{114}{}{Excellent, now share some information please.}
{114}{}{太好了，现在请分享一些信息。}
#{115}{}{That's alright. Take rest.}
{115}{}{没关系。休息一下。}
#{116}{}{Huh? What's that?}
{116}{}{呵呵？那是什么？}
#{117}{}{Huh? What's that? I'll do fine without it.}
{117}{}{呵呵？那是什么？没有它我也行。}
#{118}{}{Nothing.}
{118}{}{没有什么。}
#{119}{}{Tell me about Nelson. Who he really is?}
{119}{}{告诉我纳尔逊的事。他到底是谁？}
#{120}{}{[Looks around] Don't want to talk about it. He's paranoid, but who else, if not him, could gain a foothold here and run the mine properly? Sometimes he behaves strangely, talks some nonsense, and then you think: "What's on his mind?". Don't know what to say. Some said he's from somewhere to the south, but no one really knows for sure, because he's been here for a long time. Longer than any of us.}
{120}{}{[环顾四周]我不想谈这个。他是个偏执狂，但如果不是他，还有谁能在这里站稳脚跟，好好经营矿山呢？有时他行为古怪，说些废话，然后你会想：“他在想什么？”。不知道该说什么。有人说他是南方某个地方来的，但没人确切知道，因为他在这里已经很久了。比我们任何人都长。}
#{121}{}{What do you know about local mutants?}
{121}{}{你对当地的变种人了解多少？}
#{122}{}{About what? Marylin? Ha-ha, joking, these creatures underground are just worms - that is, really big ones. One old miner said that the larvae were in the rock. When they were dug up, they started to grow and gain weight. Probably, radiation has something to do with it. But who the hell cares now?}
{122}{}{关于什么？马里林？哈哈，开玩笑的，这些地下的生物只是虫子――也就是说，真的很大。一位老矿工说幼虫在岩石里。当他们被挖出来时，他们开始长胖。可能是辐射造成的。但现在谁在乎呢？}
#{123}{}{This miner suffers from the two diseases in a row - irradiation and tuberculosis.}
{123}{}{这名矿工连续患上两种疾病――放疗和肺结核。}
#{124}{}{Tough case, can't do much without special medications.}
{124}{}{很难，没有特殊的药物就做不了什么。}
#{125}{}{Symptoms of various diseases... I don't get it!}
{125}{}{各种疾病的症状...我不明白！}
#{126}{}{You can't grasp the essence of the patient's sickness.}
{126}{}{你不能理解病人病的本质。}
#{127}{}{Hardly a fitting solution.}
{127}{}{这不是一个合适的解决方案。}
#{128}{}{This skill won't help here.}
{128}{}{这技能在这里没用。}
#{129}{}{You managed to heal the patient. After a few more weeks of rehabilitation period, he should fully recover.}
{129}{}{你设法治愈了病人。经过几周的康复期，他应该完全康复了。}
#{130}{}{I'm still alive, doc? So, I still have chances to get Marylin laid...}
{130}{}{我还活着，医生？所以，我还有机会和玛丽琳上床...}
#{131}{}{You intravenously inject the drug into the patient's arm. Soon he will surely feel better.}
{131}{}{你给病人手臂静脉注射药物。不久他一定会感觉好些。}
#{132}{}{You intravenously inject the poison into the gullible patient's arm.}
{132}{}{你把毒药静脉注射到易受骗病人的手臂上。}
#{133}{}{You have already injected that drug. Second dose won't do anything here.}
{133}{}{你已经注射了那种药。第二剂在这里没用。}
#{134}{}{It's now useless.}
{134}{}{现在没用了。}
#{135}{}{Doc, you know what you're doing, right? I'm trusting you...}
{135}{}{医生，你知道你在做什么，对吧？我相信你...}
#{136}{}{Doc, I'm feeling so bad... Is this normal?}
{136}{}{医生，我很难过...这正常吗？}
#{137}{}{Coughs... Was this really... A medicine... Doc?}
{137}{}{咳嗽...这真的是...一种药...医生？}
#{138}{}{Looks like as if death took the patient naturally.}
{138}{}{看来病人死得很自然。}
#{139}{}{Now rest.}
{139}{}{现在休息。}
