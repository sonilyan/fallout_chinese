#{100}{}{You see Huey.}
{100}{}{你看到休伊了。}
#{101}{}{You see Huey. He's the same as before.}
{101}{}{你看到休伊了。他和以前一样。}
#{102}{}{Do what you want.}
{102}{}{做你想做的。}
#{110}{}{[Speaking to the victim] That's far enough. Here we should part ways. My father wanted to kill you, but I won't. And beg my partner to do the same.}
{110}{}{[对受害者说]够了。在这里我们应该分道扬镳。我父亲想杀了你，但我不会。求我的搭档也这么做。}
#{111}{}{[Next]}
{111}{}{[下一步]}
#{112}{}{[The victim looks up at you both and speaks] Now I see why your father despises you. He always did... You are saying that I can go? I guess I ought to be thankful. I'll tell Stryker's people about what happened here.}
{112}{}{[受害者抬起头看着你们俩说]现在我明白你父亲为什么鄙视你了。他总是...你是说我可以去？我想我应该心存感激。我会告诉史崔克的人这里发生了什么。}
#{113}{}{Whoa-whoa, stop. Huey, what are you doing?}
{113}{}{哇哦，停下来。休伊，你在干什么？}
#{114}{}{Calm down, partner. Go back and tell your father I finished the job. If he learns the truth, he'll kill us both. Do you understand what I'm saying?}
{114}{}{冷静点，伙计。回去告诉你父亲我完成了任务。如果他知道真相，他会杀了我们两个。你明白我的意思吗？}
#{115}{}{Hmm...}
{115}{}{Hmm...}
#{116}{}{Are you crazy or just stupid? Sooner or later, someone's going to see him walking around *not dead*. What's your plan then?}
{116}{}{你疯了还是傻了？迟早有人会看到他四处走动，还没死。那你的计划是什么？}
#{117}{}{I'm not going to be part of mess that my father and the other crime bosses make in this city. I don't care what he says. I don't care what he thinks. I'm not doing it.}
{117}{}{我不会成为我父亲和其他犯罪头目在这个城市制造的混乱的一部分。我不管他说什么。我不管他怎么想。我不会这么做的。}
#{118}{}{Again with this angsty rebellion bullshit? Grow up! Take your gun and do what you have to!}
{118}{}{又是这种愤怒的反抗？长大吧！带上你的枪，做你该做的！}
#{119}{}{Don't push me! I don't owe you anything! I don't owe anyone!}
{119}{}{别逼我！我什么都不欠你！我不欠任何人！}
#{120}{}{You're weak! Pathetic! Get yourself together, this is your last chance to save your relationship with your father! Did you forget what happened to the others? Do you want that? Huh? Look at me! Face reality for once!}
{120}{}{你太软弱了！可怜的！振作起来，这是你挽救你和你父亲关系的最后机会！你忘了其他人的事了吗？你想要吗？呵呵？看着我！一次面对现实！}
#{121}{}{Suit yourself. It's your life.}
{121}{}{随便你。这是你的生活。}
#{122}{}{Shut up! [he draws his head into shoulders and turns away from you] Kill him yourself then! I won't do it! I... I won't!}
{122}{}{闭嘴！[他把头伸进肩膀，转身离开你]那你自己杀了他！我不会做的！一、 ...我不会的！}
#{123}{}{[Take Huey's hand and point his weapon at the victim] Just pull the trigger, Huey. Just once. That's all it takes, and then you're free.}
{123}{}{[抓住休伊的手，用枪指着受害者]扣动扳机，休伊。就一次。就这些，然后你就自由了。}
#{124}{}{[Huey trembles, becomes pale and turns his face away from the victim] Forgive me...}
{124}{}{[休伊颤抖着，脸色变得苍白，把脸转离受害者]原谅我...}
#{125}{}{[Next]}
{125}{}{[下一步]}
#{126}{}{[Huey's gun fires once, then again and again, as crimson blossoms on the twitching victim's clothes. An artery is torn open as he falls, a fine thick red mist sprays around, settling on your and Huey. Finally, Huey's weapon clicks empty, and the victim's body lies still.]}
{126}{}{[休伊的枪开了一次又一次，一次又一次，在抽搐的受害者衣服上绽放着深红。当他摔倒时，一条动脉被撕开了，一层厚厚的红色细雾在周围喷发，落在你和休伊身上。最后，休伊的武器咔嚓一声空了，受害者的身体一动不动。]}
#{127}{}{It's over, Huey. Wasn't so hard as it seemed, was it?}
{127}{}{结束了，休伊。并不像看上去那么难，是吗？}
#{128}{}{It's done Huey. You can turn your head now.}
{128}{}{结束了，休伊。你现在可以转头了。}
#{129}{}{[Huey, breathing heavily, struggles to turn his head towards the victim. He rubs his hand across his face and gags in horror seeing blood smears across it. He breaks free from your hands] Leave me! Leave me alone!..}
{129}{}{[休伊喘着粗气，挣扎着把头转向受害者。他用手在脸上蹭来蹭去，看到脸上有血迹，吓得哽咽起来。他挣脱了你的手]离开我！别管我！。。}
#{130}{}{Don't worry, boy. It gets easier. Soon, you won't feel anything at all.}
{130}{}{别担心，孩子。变得容易了。很快，你就什么都感觉不到了。}
#{1110}{}{[Speaking to the victim] That's far enough. Here we should part ways. My father wanted to kill you, but I won't. And beg my partner to do the same.}
{1110}{}{[对受害者说]够了。在这里我们应该分道扬镳。我父亲想杀了你，但我不会。求我的搭档也这么做。}
#{1122}{}{Shut up! [he draws his head into shoulders and turns away from you] Kill him yourself then! I won't do it! I... I won't!}
{1122}{}{闭嘴！[他把头伸进肩膀，转身离开你]那你自己杀了他！我不会做的！一、 ...我不会的！}
