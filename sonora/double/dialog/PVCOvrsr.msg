{200}{}{给人印象深刻的你设法在没有发出警报的情况下进入了保险库，越过了警卫，到达了指挥中心。这种程度的间谍活动极为罕见。那你为什么在这里？ -- Impressive. You managed to get into the Vault without raising an alarm, get past the guards and get to the command center itself. Such a level of espionage is extremely rare. So why are you here?}

### {210}{}{I'm looking for my tribesmen from the Villa. They say the Followers of Fire enslaved them.}
{210}{}{我在别墅里找我的部落成员。他们说火的追随者奴役了他们。 -- I'm looking for my tribesmen from the Villa. They say the Followers of Fire enslaved them.}
### {211}{}{Villa... I remember. One of the primitive villages in the northwest. The slaves were transported from there to Two-Sun and now they will become fuel in the progress machine. It's a great honor, even if you don't like it.}
{211}{}{别墅。。。我记得。西北部的一个原始村庄。奴隶们从那里被运送到两个太阳，现在他们将成为进步机器的燃料。这是一种莫大的荣誉，即使你不喜欢。 -- Villa... I remember. One of the primitive villages in the northwest.

### {212}{}{Why do you need slaves?}
{212}{}{你为什么需要奴隶？ -- Why do you need slaves?}
### {213}{}{Oh, there are many reasons - infrastructure restoration, work in mines, transportation between cities and much of what will be much more difficult to do by the forces of free mercenaries. The development of civilization requires large labor resources. And slavery is the most appropriate way to get them.}
{213}{}{哦，原因有很多――基础设施的恢复、矿山的工作、城市之间的运输，以及自由雇佣军部队更难做到的许多事情。文明的发展需要大量的劳动力资源。奴役是获得它们的最合适的方式。 -- Oh, there are many reasons - infrastructure restoration, work in mines, transportation between cities and much of what will be much more difficult to do by the forces of free mercenaries.

{214}{}{奴役无辜的人有可能吗？ -- Is it possible to enslave innocent people?}
### {215}{}{Most of the locals are busy surviving and do not contribute to the development of the region at all. On the contrary, they are ready to fight and are not ready to cooperate. Narrow-minded egoism is what tribes like your Villa live by. To turn the power of these savages to the benefit of the whole region is a worthy goal to sacrifice the ethical side of the issue.}
{215}{}{大多数当地人忙于生存，根本没有为该地区的发展做出贡献。相反，他们准备战斗，却不准备合作。狭隘的利己主义是像你的别墅这样的部落赖以生存的。将这些野蛮人的力量转化为整个地区的利益是一个值得牺牲道德方面的目标。 -- Most of the locals are busy surviving and do not contribute to the development of the region at all. On the contrary, they are ready to fight and are not ready to cooperate. Narrow-minded egoism is what tribes like your Villa live by.

### {216}{}{What kind of progress are you talking about?}
{216}{}{你在说什么样的进步？ -- What kind of progress are you talking about?}
### {217}{}{You've come a long way, haven't you? The usual landscape now is a barren wasteland or the ruins of ancient cities. Life in such conditions is difficult and dangerous. But there are places where civilization returns. Electricity, medicine, education - all this has returned to the lands of Sonora thanks to us. And compared to this, the small household concerns of the Villa are nothing more than a mouse fuss.}
{217}{}{你已经走过了很长的路，不是吗？现在通常的景观是贫瘠的荒地或古城废墟。在这样的条件下生活是困难和危险的。但也有文明回归的地方。电力、医疗、教育――多亏了我们，所有这些都回到了索诺拉的土地上。与此相比，别墅的小家庭问题只不过是小题大做。 -- You've come a long way, haven't you? The usual landscape now is a barren wasteland or the ruins of ancient cities. Life in such conditions is difficult and dangerous. But there are places where civilization returns. Electricity, medicine, education - all this has returned to the lands of Sonora thanks to us. And compared to this, the small household concerns of the Villa are nothing more than a mouse fuss.}
### {218}{}{And what's next - are you going to enslave the whole of Sonora?}
{218}{}{接下来你会奴役整个索诺拉吗？ -- And what's next - are you going to enslave the whole of Sonora?}
### {219}{}{That would be too wasteful. It is much easier to create habitable centers of civilization. By themselves, these colonies will be an example - a model to which the rest of the savages will catch up.}
{219}{}{那太浪费了。创造宜居的文明中心要容易得多。就其本身而言，这些殖民地将是一个榜样――其他野蛮人将效仿的榜样。 -- That would be too wasteful. It is much easier to create habitable centers of civilization. By themselves, these colonies will be an example - a model to which the rest of the savages will catch up.}
### {220}{}{The villa didn't need your "civilization". We had a lot of food and a complete order in the community.}
{220}{}{别墅不需要你的“文明”。我们在社区里有很多食物和完整的订单。 -- The villa didn't need your "civilization". We had a lot of food and a complete order in the community.}
### {221}{}{You're wrong. Your community is living out the last generations. Exhaustion of fertility, accumulation of mutations, high mortality rate, insecurity from external enemies and ordinary narrow-mindedness - all this limits your community and leads to imminent death. Don't you believe it? In vain. We have seen entire settlements go crazy just because the only water pump there broke down.}
{221}{}{你错了。你们的社区正在延续上一代人的生活。生育能力的耗尽、突变的积累、高死亡率、来自外部敌人的不安全感和普通的狭隘思想――所有这些都限制了你的社区，并导致迫在眉睫的死亡。你不相信吗？徒劳。我们看到整个定居点因为那里唯一的水泵坏了而变得疯狂。 -- You're wrong. Your community is living out the last generations. Exhaustion of fertility, accumulation of mutations, high mortality rate, insecurity from external enemies and ordinary narrow-mindedness - all this limits your community and leads to imminent death.

### {222}{}{And what does your cult offer?}
{222}{}{你的邪教提供了什么？ -- And what does your cult offer?}
### {223}{}{A return to civilization, of course. And we have already achieved a lot.}
{223}{}{当然是文明的回归。我们已经取得了很多成就。 -- A return to civilization, of course. And we have already achieved a lot.}
### {224}{}{Nonsense. You are simply parasitizing other people.}
{224}{}{胡说你只是寄生在别人身上。 -- Nonsense. You are simply parasitizing other people.}
### {225}{}{That's reasonable. Sonora clearly lacks a strong hand to unite the fallen population.}
{225}{}{这是合理的。索诺拉显然缺乏团结衰落人口的有力力量。 -- That's reasonable. Sonora clearly lacks a strong hand to unite the fallen population.}
### {226}{}{It's a pity that you didn't manage to get into our ideas. However, nothing new. You're just an ordinary hindrance to our plans. I'll have to eliminate you...}
{226}{}{很遗憾你没能理解我们的想法。然而，没有什么新鲜事。你只是我们计划的一个普通障碍。我必须淘汰你。。。 -- It's a pity that you didn't manage to get into our ideas. However, nothing new. You're just an ordinary hindrance to our plans. I'll have to eliminate you...}
### {227}{}{Wait, we haven't...}
{227}{}{等等，我们还没有。。。 -- Wait, we haven't...}
### {228}{}{To do this, it is necessary to abandon the past - from superstitions, traditions and even family ties. Are you ready for such hardships?}
{228}{}{要做到这一点，就必须抛弃过去――抛弃迷信、传统甚至家庭关系。你准备好面对这样的困难了吗？ -- To do this, it is necessary to abandon the past - from superstitions, traditions and even family ties. Are you ready for such hardships?}

### {231}{}{In this case, prove your intentions - become a part of the cult of the Sacred Fire. By this you will give an example to your fellow tribesmen.}
{231}{}{在这种情况下，证明你的意图――成为圣火崇拜的一部分。这样，你将给你的部落同胞们树立一个榜样。 -- In this case, prove your intentions - become a part of the cult of the Sacred Fire. By this you will give an example to your fellow tribesmen.}
### {232}{}{Become a Follower? I'll have to talk to Aaron first. And what's next?}
{232}{}{成为追随者？我得先和亚伦谈谈。接下来是什么？ -- Become a Follower? I'll have to talk to Aaron first. And what's next?}
