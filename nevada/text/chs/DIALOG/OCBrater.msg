#{104}{}{Oh, god! She was all I had left!}

#{121}{}{It's you! Good to see you, man. Not a lot of guys like you left in the wastes.}
{121}{}{是你！很高兴见到你，伙计。像你这样的人不多了。}
#{122}{}{Can you fix the water tank in Lovelock?}

#{123}{}{About that water pump.}

#{124}{}{How can you pay me for my help?}

#{125}{}{What really happened, anyway?}

#{129}{}{Take care.}

#{130}{}{[He grabs his head] I didn't mean for this to happen! Now the community is doomed for sure! [suddenly looks up] Where's Susie? Is she okay?!}
{130}{}{[他抓着头]我不是故意的！现在这个社区注定要失败！苏西在哪里？她没事吧？！}
#{131}{}{Uh, yeah, sure. I'll just see you outside.}
{131}{}{嗯，是的，当然。我们在外面见。}
#{137}{}{No way, I can't leave my sister. And where would I go? Black-Rock would never take me, and Reno... No, I'll never go back to Reno.}
{137}{}{不行，我不能离开我妹妹。我要去哪里？黑岩永远不会带走我，雷诺...不，我再也不回雷诺了。}
#{139}{}{I fixed the water pump. It's running smoothly now.}
{139}{}{我把水泵修好了。现在运转平稳。}
#{140}{}{I have this fuse. Will this help?}
{140}{}{我有保险丝。这个有用吗？}
#{141}{}{Holy shit, this is perfect! Where'd you get it? Go show it to Gerlach, and he might let me go!}
{141}{}{妈的，太完美了！你从哪儿弄来的？去拿给杰拉克看，他可能会放我走！}
#{142}{}{This one? Looks like that part I blew up.Please, install it into the pump... Uh, carefully. I'd do it myself, but Gerlach won't let me outside.}
{142}{}{这个？看起来像是我吹掉的那部分请起来，将其安装到泵中...呃，小心点。我自己会做的，但杰拉克不让我出去。}
#{143}{}{I can free you, if you pay.}
{143}{}{如果你付钱的话，我可以释放你。}
#{144}{}{I don't have anything... But I know where to find a stash of good stuff. But I won't tell you until I'm out of here!}
{144}{}{我什么都没有...但我知道在哪里能找到好东西。但在我离开之前我不会告诉你的！}
#{145}{}{We'll see.}
{145}{}{我们拭目以待。}
#{146}{}{Oh, I almost forgot. If you need any help, just talk to me. I can improve a leather jacket for you - not just stronger, but optimized to carry more stuff.}
{146}{}{哦，我差点忘了。如果你需要帮助，就跟我说。我可以为你改进一件皮夹克――不仅更结实，而且经过优化，可以携带更多的东西。}
#{147}{}{I'll think about it. Bye.}
{147}{}{我会考虑的。再见。}
#{148}{}{You have freed the prisoner from his captivity.}
{148}{}{你把犯人从囚禁中释放出来了。}
#{149}{}{People here are from all over. Gerlach thinks we can survive if we all stick together and take responsibility for ourselves. I've never seen a place like this before, but I really believed in it, even though it almost got me killed. Now, I don't know what to think.}
{149}{}{这里的人来自世界各地。杰拉克认为，如果我们团结一致，对自己负责，我们就能生存下去。我以前从没见过这样的地方，但我真的相信它，尽管它差点把我害死。现在，我不知道该怎么想。}
#{150}{}{People here are from all over. Gerlach thinks we can survive if we all stick together and take responsibility for ourselves. I've never seen a place like this before, but I really believe in it, even if it almost got me killed.}
{150}{}{这里的人来自世界各地。杰拉克认为，如果我们团结一致，对自己负责，我们就能生存下去。我以前从没见过这样的地方，但我真的很相信它，即使它差点把我害死。}
#{151}{}{I'm just a guy from New Reno. I do this and that, but my sister's the skilled one. Everyone loves her cooking.}
{151}{}{我只是从新雷诺来的。我做这做那，但我妹妹是个能干的人。每个人都喜欢她的烹饪。}
#{152}{}{I have nowhere to go. Me and my sister aren't going back to Reno, and there's nothing in the wastes but geckos and radscorpions. This is all we've got.}
{152}{}{我无处可去。我和我妹妹不回雷诺了，垃圾里除了壁虎和蝎子什么都没有。我们只有这些了。}
#{153}{}{They had me watch the water pump. It's the only source of water out here.}
{153}{}{他们让我看水泵。这是这里唯一的水源。}
#{154}{}{Go on.}
{154}{}{继续。}
#{155}{}{But it's old, and you've got to keep an eye on it. I fell asleep on the job and the fuse burned out... I think that's what it's called. Whatever it is, the pump won't work without it.}
{155}{}{但它是旧的，你得注意它。我在工作时睡着了保险丝烧断了...我想这就是它的名字。不管它是什么，没有它泵就不能工作。}
#{156}{}{Long story short, we've got no water. So, everyone was going to have me for it. That's when you came along.}
{156}{}{长话短说，我们没有水了。所以，每个人都会有我。就在那时你来了。}
#{157}{}{It's all my fault. I nearly got myself killed, I nearly left my sister all alone, I nearly destroyed the whole community... This is heavy. Makes you rethink everything. I feel like a different man... I've got to start taking responsibility.}
{157}{}{都是我的错。我差点害死自己，差点丢下妹妹一个人，差点毁了整个社区...这个很重。让你重新思考一切。我觉得自己是另一个人...我必须开始承担责任。}
#{158}{}{It works great, all thanks to you. You didn't just save me, you saved the whole community.}
{158}{}{很好用，都是你的功劳。你不仅救了我，还救了整个社区。}
#{159}{}{The fuse burned out and I don't have a slightest clue how to fix it. You'll need to find a new one, or make one yourself, if you know how.}
{159}{}{保险丝烧断了，我一点也不知道怎么修。你需要找一个新的，或者自己做一个，如果你知道怎么做的话。}
#{160}{}{Will this fuse do the job?}
{160}{}{这个保险丝行吗？}
#{161}{}{That's all.}
{161}{}{这就是全部。}
#{162}{}{Only one way to find out! Hurry, we need that water yesterday!}
{162}{}{只有一个办法能找到答案！快点，我们昨天需要水！}
#{163}{}{Fine.}
{163}{}{好的。}
#{164}{}{Reno? How far is it?}
{164}{}{雷诺？有多远？}
#{165}{}{Not that far. I'll show you on your map. But it gets more dangerous the closer you get, so try to stay off the roads.}
{165}{}{不远。我会在地图上指给你看。但是离得越近就越危险，所以尽量不要上路。}
#{166}{}{Thanks.}
{166}{}{谢谢。}
#{170}{}{Hell yeah, I'll do it! I owe you my life! I'll go get it done right now!}
{170}{}{是的，我会的！我欠你我的命！我现在就去做！}
#{171}{}{Please do.}
{171}{}{请这样做。}
#{172}{}{No, wait. I'll figure it out myself. And if I can't, I'll come back and ask for your help.}
{172}{}{不，等等。我自己想办法。如果我做不到，我会回来请求你的帮助。}
#{173}{}{Well, okay. But I'm always ready to work!}
{173}{}{好吧，好吧。但我随时准备工作！}
#{174}{}{Perhaps you're right. Head to Lovelock.}
{174}{}{也许你是对的。去洛夫洛克。}
#{175}{}{Stay here. I'll come get you if I need you.}
{175}{}{呆在这里。如果我需要你，我会来接你的。}
#{176}{}{Leave it up to me! I won't blow this up!}
{176}{}{交给我吧！我不会炸掉这个！}
#{177}{}{Great.}
{177}{}{伟大的。}
#{178}{}{I would, but if I try to leave before the pump is fixed, they'll probably try to kill me again.}
{178}{}{我会的，但如果我想在水泵修好之前离开，他们可能会再次杀了我。}
#{179}{}{Right.}
{179}{}{正确的。}
#{180}{}{You found an easy way to fix Lovelock's water shortage.}
{180}{}{你找到了解决洛夫洛克缺水的简单方法。}
#{181}{}{Let me think... I don't have much. But I can improve your leather jacket or do any sort of handyman work. }

#{183}{}{Uh, sure.}
{183}{}{呃，当然。}
#{184}{}{I'll come back if I need your help.}
{184}{}{如果我需要你的帮助，我会回来的。}
#{185}{}{Oh, wait! [he gives you some weapon parts] It's not much, but I'm sure you can use these for something. That, or sell them.}
{185}{}{哦，等等！[他给了你一些武器部件]不多，但我相信你可以用这些做点什么。或者卖掉它们。}
#{190}{}{I have a leather jacket for you to fix up.}
{190}{}{我有件皮夹克要你修理。}
#{191}{}{This leather jacket's seen better days. Can you restore it?}
{191}{}{这件皮夹克以前很流行。你能恢复吗？}
#{192}{}{Sure! Give it here.}
{192}{}{当然！把它给我。}
#{194}{}{What jacket? I don't see it.}
{194}{}{什么夹克？我看不出来。}
#{195}{}{Oops... }
{195}{}{哎呀...}
#{196}{}{Done! Try it out!}
{196}{}{完成！试试看！}
#{197}{}{Okay.}
{197}{}{可以。}
#{200}{}{What do you think about moving from here?}
{200}{}{你觉得离开这里怎么样？}
#{201}{}{This place isn't safe without Gerlach. If we get the chance to move, we'd better take it.}
{201}{}{没有Gerlach这个地方是不安全的。如果我们有机会搬家，我们最好抓住机会。}
#{202}{}{After that situation with the pump, it's only a matter of time before Gerlach finds some reason to get rid of me. If I get the chance to move, I'll take it.}
{202}{}{在泵的情况下，这只是一个时间问题，杰拉克找到一些理由摆脱我。如果我有机会搬家，我会接受的。}
#{203}{}{You said something about a stash earlier.}
{203}{}{你刚才说有个藏匿处。}
#{204}{}{Oh, yeah, well... I don't actually know where it is, but my sister told me about it once. Ask her and she'll tell you.}
{204}{}{哦，是的，好吧...我不知道它在哪里，但我姐姐告诉过我一次。问她，她会告诉你的。}
#{205}{}{It's the same one my sister told you about.}
{205}{}{就是我姐姐告诉你的那个。}
#{206}{}{Oh, is that how it is?}
{206}{}{哦，是这样吗？}
#{207}{}{[His smile fades] Didn't my sister already tell you about Gerlach's stash? What else do you want?}
{207}{}{我姐姐不是已经告诉过你杰拉克的藏匿处了吗？你还想要什么？}
#{208}{}{Okay!}
{208}{}{可以！}
#{1110}{}{You saved my life! For how long, I don't know, but before you showed up, I didn't have a chance!}
{1110}{}{你救了我的命！有多久了，我不知道，但在你出现之前，我没有机会！}
#{1120}{}{You saved my life! Thank you. But the people here will never forgive me. Damn it.}
{1120}{}{你救了我的命！非常感谢。但是这里的人永远不会原谅我。该死的。}
#{1121}{}{It's you! Good to see you again. Not a lot of girls like you left in the wastes.}
{1121}{}{是你！很高兴再次见到你。像你这样的女孩不多。}
