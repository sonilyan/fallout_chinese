#{150}{}{You see Greg.}
{150}{}{你看到格雷格了。}
#{250}{}{You see Greg, the local doctor.}
{250}{}{你看格雷格，当地的医生。}
#{300}{}{It's like that mold is indestructible.}
{300}{}{好像那个模子是不可摧毁的。}
#{301}{}{I might have to start giving them amphetamines instead of ointments.}
{301}{}{我可能得开始给他们安非他命而不是药膏。}
#{500}{}{Hi, I'm Greg, the local doctor. Don't say anything. You look like you need help. Let me take a look.}
{500}{}{嗨，我是格雷格，当地的医生。什么都别说。你看起来需要帮助。让我看看。}
#{501}{}{[OK.]}
{501}{}{[好的。]}
#{502}{}{You have a rather bad wound on your head. Due to shock, you might not even know about it. It should be better now. How do you feel?}
{502}{}{你头上的伤很严重。由于震惊，你甚至可能不知道。现在应该好多了。你觉得怎么样？}
#{503}{}{Me remember not.}
{503}{}{我不记得了。}
#{504}{}{Thank you, it is better, but I can't remember a thing. It's possible that I have amnesia.}
{504}{}{谢谢，好多了，但我什么都记不起来了。我可能有健忘症。}
#{505}{}{I... I don't remember anything.}
{505}{}{我 ……我什么都不记得了。}
#{550}{}{Hmm, I suppose the wound was deep enough to cause memory loss. It will hopefully come back, just give it time. Unfortunately, that's not the case for the other mental damage.}
{550}{}{嗯，我想伤口很深，足以导致记忆丧失。希望它能回来，给它点时间。不幸的是，另一种精神损害并非如此。}
#{551}{}{Me }
{551}{}{我}
#{552}{}{See? Well done! You remember your name! Do you remember anything else?}
{552}{}{看到了吗？做得好！你记得你的名字！你还记得什么吗？}
#{553}{}{Remember! Bam, bam!! Pain... Rat want nom nom me!}
{553}{}{记得！砰，砰！！疼痛……老鼠把我拖走了！}
#{554}{}{Uhm, maybe I should take another look at the wound. Perhaps there's still something stuck in there.}
{554}{}{嗯，也许我应该再看看伤口。也许还有什么东西卡在里面。}
#{555}{}{Nooooo!}
{555}{}{不-不-不！}
#{556}{}{All right, all right. I won't touch it anymore. Are you from a vault, perhaps? You're wearing their jumpsuit.}
{556}{}{好吧，好吧。我不会再碰它了。你也许是从保险库来的？你穿着他们的连身衣。}
#{557}{}{Wowlt? Nooooo!!! Wowlt ewww!! No like men from big hole.}
{557}{}{沃尔特？不-不-不！！！哇哦！！不像来自大洞里的人。}
#{558}{}{Okay, too bad for the previous owner. You should probably go now.}
{558}{}{好吧，对以前的主人来说太糟糕了。你该走了。}
#{559}{}{Huuuh? [Stick your talisman in front of his face.]}
{559}{}{喂？[把你的护身符放在他面前。]}
#{560}{}{Huuuh? [Wave your arms in the air.]}
{560}{}{喂？[在空中挥舞你的手臂。]}
#{561}{}{What? No, I don't know it. I don't recognize that symbol.}
{561}{}{什么？不，我不知道。我不认识那个符号。}
#{562}{}{[Frown.]}
{562}{}{[皱眉]}
#{563}{}{Try asking our mayor. Although she probably won't have time for you.}
{563}{}{试着问问我们的市长。尽管她可能没有时间陪你。}
#{564}{}{Yea yea.}
{564}{}{是的，是的。}
#{565}{}{Also, Oswald wanted to talk to you. He's the one that brought you here. Poor guy doesn't know what he's getting himself into.}
{565}{}{还有，奥斯瓦尔德想和你谈谈。是他把你带到这里来的。可怜的家伙不知道自己在干什么。}
#{566}{}{Byeee.}
{566}{}{再见。}
#{567}{}{What? I don't understand what you're trying to say. Why don't you rather go talk to our mayor, maybe she'll find time for you.}
{567}{}{什么？我不明白你想说什么。你为什么不去和我们的市长谈谈，也许她会有时间陪你。}
#{568}{}{Yea yea.}
{568}{}{是的，是的。}
#{600}{}{It's possible, and given the depth of the wound, likely.}
{600}{}{有可能，考虑到伤口的深度，很可能。}
#{601}{}{Do you know of any effective treatment?}
{601}{}{你知道有什么有效的治疗方法吗？}
#{650}{}{Hmm, that's possible. The wound was quite deep.}
{650}{}{嗯，那是可能的。伤口很深。}
#{651}{}{Is there something you can do about it?}
{651}{}{你能做些什么吗？}
#{700}{}{I'm afraid I can't help you there. It just needs time. During memory loss, it's helpful to be reminded of familiar things.}
{700}{}{恐怕我帮不了你。只是需要时间。在失忆期间，提醒自己熟悉的事情是很有帮助的。}
#{701}{}{Yes, I remember my name! My name is }
{701}{}{是的，我记得我的名字！我的名字是}
#{702}{}{Yes, I remember my name! My name is }
{702}{}{是的，我记得我的名字！我的名字是}
#{703}{}{That's great. Do you remember anything else?}
{703}{}{太好了。你还记得什么吗？}
#{704}{}{No... Perhaps only... A fight, gunshot, I was wounded. [You automatically touch the wound on your head and immediately wince in pain.]}
{704}{}{不……也许只是……一场战斗，一声枪响，我受伤了。[你会不自觉触摸头部的伤口，并立即因疼痛而退缩。]}
#{705}{}{No... Perhaps only... A fight, gunshot, I was wounded. [You automatically touch the wound on your head and immediately wince in pain.]}
{705}{}{不……也许只是……一场战斗，一声枪响，我受伤了。[你会不自觉触摸头部的伤口，并立即因疼痛而退缩。]}
#{706}{}{You better not touch that wound, it's far from healed.}
{706}{}{你最好别碰那个伤口，还远没有愈合。}
#{707}{}{That's how it must have happened... Afterwards I just remember waking up. That damned rat was pulling me into its lair.}
{707}{}{一定是这样的……后来我只记得醒来。那该死的老鼠把我拉到它的巢穴里。}
#{708}{}{You're lucky to be alive. I see you're wearing a vault jumpsuit. The thirteen on your back should indicate the number of the vault. Is that where you come from?}
{708}{}{你还活着真幸运。我看到你穿了一件避难所服装。你背上的十三应该标明了你的避难所的编号。你就是从这里来的吗？}
#{709}{}{No, definitely not. I feel it... Now that you brought it up, I remember some sort of... yes, hatred! Hatred towards the people from vaults!}
{709}{}{不，绝对不是。我感觉到了……既然你提出来了，我记得有点……是的，仇恨！是对避难所里的，人的仇恨！}
#{710}{}{Maybe you picked it up from a corpse. Some people wear vault jumpsuits, but aren't themselves from a vault. I just hope you're not some murderer, we don't stand such people around here.}
{710}{}{也许是你从尸体上捡到的。有些人穿避难所服装，但他们自己不是避难所的。我只希望你不是什么杀人犯，我们这里不允许这样的人。}
#{711}{}{I don't know, I don't remember. I'll have to search for my past. My only clue is this talisman. [Show him your talisman.] I'm sure that it's very important in my life. Have you seen it before?}
{711}{}{我不知道，我不记得了。我将不得不寻找我的过去。我唯一的线索就是这个护身符。[给他看你的护身符]我相信这对我的生活很重要。你以前见过吗？}
#{712}{}{I don't know, I don't remember. I'll have to search for my past. My only clue is the talisman I had on me. [Describe the talisman.] I'm sure that it's very important in my life. Have you seen something like that before?}
{712}{}{我不知道，我不记得了。我将不得不寻找我的过去。我唯一的线索就是我身上的护身符。[描述护身符]我确信它在我的生活中非常重要。你以前见过这样的事吗？}
#{713}{}{No, it doesn't seem familiar.}
{713}{}{不，好像不熟悉。}
#{714}{}{Do you know of anyone who might know more?}
{714}{}{你知道有谁可能知道得更多吗？}
#{715}{}{Thanks anyway. I'll try asking somewhere else.}
{715}{}{无论如何谢谢你。我去别的地方问问。}
#{716}{}{Thanks anyway. How much do I owe you for the treatment?}
{716}{}{无论如何谢谢你。我欠你多少治疗费？}
#{750}{}{Talk to the mayor, she might know something.}
{750}{}{和市长谈谈，她可能知道些什么。}
#{751}{}{All right, I will.}
{751}{}{好吧，我会的。}
#{800}{}{Wait a minute. I don't ask for anything in return for your treatment, even though I normally charge people. It was a matter of life and death. But I would appreciate if you could help me with something.}
{800}{}{等一下。我不要求任何回报你的治疗，即使我通常收费的人。这是一个生死攸关的问题。但如果你能帮我做点什么我会很感激的。}
#{801}{}{With what?}
{801}{}{用什么？}
#{850}{}{Nothing, it's all right. I normally charge for treatment, but this was a matter of life and death. If you want to repay the favor, though, I could use your help with something.}
{850}{}{没什么，没关系。我通常收取治疗费，但这是一个生死攸关的问题。不过，如果你想报答我的好意，我需要你的帮助。}
#{851}{}{With what?}
{851}{}{用什么？}
#{900}{}{My wife lost something. You better talk directly with her, I'm having trouble putting up with her endless complaining.}
{900}{}{我妻子丢了东西。你最好直接和她谈谈，我很难忍受她没完没了的抱怨。}
#{901}{}{All right. Thanks for everything.}
{901}{}{好吧。谢谢你所做的一切。}
#{902}{}{Oh yeah, I almost forgot! Oswald, the man who brought you here, would like to talk to you. You'll probably find him in his tent.}
{902}{}{哦，是的，我差点忘了！奥斯瓦尔德，带你来的那个人，想和你谈谈。你可能会在他的帐篷里找到他。}
#{903}{}{I'll look for him.}
{903}{}{我去找他。}
#{950}{}{What ails you this time? I hope it's not the local mold.}
{950}{}{这次你怎么了？我希望不是当地的霉菌。}
#{951}{}{I have some kind of an injury. Could you heal me?}
{951}{}{我受伤了。你能治好我吗？}
#{952}{}{I have blood poisoning. Can you do something about it?}
{952}{}{我血液中毒。你能做点什么吗？}
#{953}{}{Can you heal one of my companions?}
{953}{}{你能治好我的一个同伴吗？}

{955}{}{流口水！}
#{956}{}{Mutt huuurt!}
{956}{}{穆特 呼-呼-呼！}
#{957}{}{Nothing, actually.}
{957}{}{其实没什么。}
#{958}{}{Nooo!}
{958}{}{不！}
#{1000}{}{Certainly. One doesn't see a real injury very often around here.}
{1000}{}{当然。在这附近很少有人看到真正的受伤。}
#{1001}{}{Thanks.}
{1001}{}{谢谢。}
#{1002}{}{Do you have the money? It'll be 20 caps.}
{1002}{}{你有钱吗？一共20个。}
#{1003}{}{Yes.}

{1200}{}{你还好，至少身体上还好。}
#{1201}{}{Byee.}

{1250}{}{谢谢你帮助我妻子，我再也受不了了。作为回报，如果你给我一朵锦葵和一根仙人掌，我会免费给你做一些治疗粉。}
#{1251}{}{What is it good for?}
{1251}{}{有什么用？}
#{1252}{}{Huh?}
{1252}{}{嗯？}
#{1253}{}{Since I don't have the proper ingredients to make medicaments, I've experimented with the local plants. I've discovered that the combination of these two has healing properties. It does have side effects though. It deteriorates your eyesight slightly, but only temporarily.}
{1253}{}{因为我没有合适的原料来做药物，我就用当地的植物做实验。我发现这两者的结合有治疗作用。但它确实有副作用。它会稍微降低你的视力，但只是暂时的。}
#{1254}{}{Thanks.}
{1254}{}{谢谢。}
#{1255}{}{Ugh.}
{1255}{}{啊。}
#{1300}{}{Ah, my favorite patient, who brought silence to my ears. What can I do for you?}

{1500}{}{好了，我说完了。总共30个。}
#{1501}{}{Here you go.}
{1501}{}{干得好。}
#{1550}{}{That won't be a problem. I treat everyone here, people, dogs, even brahmin. There isn't much of a difference, anyway. Do you have the money?}
{1550}{}{那不是问题。我对待这里的每一个人，狗，甚至双头牛。都是平等的。你有钱吗？}
#{1551}{}{Yes.}
{1551}{}{对。}
#{1552}{}{No.}
