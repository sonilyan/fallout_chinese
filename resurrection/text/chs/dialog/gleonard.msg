{503}{}{布瓦？}
#{504}{}{Byee.}

#{550}{}{You must be new around here. That means you came to the right place. My name is Leonard and my duties include welcoming any newcomers. I'm sure you have many questions. Ask away.}
{550}{}{你一定是新来的。那意味着你来对地方了。我叫伦纳德，我的职责包括欢迎任何新来的人。我肯定你有很多问题。去问吧。}
#{551}{}{Can a ghoul really turn back into a normal human again? Is it really true?}
{551}{}{僵尸真的能重新变成正常人吗？这是真的吗？}
#{600}{}{[He smiles, almost imperceptibly.] Everyone always asks me that question sooner or later, in one way or another. The answer is yes. Rebirth is possible and this is where it happens.}
{600}{}{[他笑了，几乎是不知不觉的]每个人迟早都会以这样或那样的方式问我这个问题。答案是肯定的。重生是可能的，这就是它发生的地方。}
#{601}{}{But...}
{601}{}{但是。。。}
#{650}{}{But how is it possible? And how come all you see are ghouls here? In this complex, there's the machine that can do it. It was developed by scientists just before the war. Right now we're gathering sufficient... um... material for the rebirth of everyone. Before that day comes however, only one exceptional individual is reborn per year. That is a great occasion for all of us and a tremendous honor for the Reborn.}
{650}{}{但怎么可能呢？为什么你看到的都是僵尸？在这个综合体里，有一台机器可以做到。它是在战争前由科学家发明的。现在我们正在收集足够的。。。嗯。。。每个人重生的材料。然而，在那一天到来之前，每年只有一个例外的个体重生。这对我们所有人来说都是一个伟大的时刻，对重生来说也是一个巨大的荣誉。}

#{750}{}{You mean in person? Well, if you have advanced scientific or technical skills, then, after you're cleared, you might be lucky enough to work on the fifth floor where the machine is located. I haven't seen it myself, but more delightful for me was seeing it on a screen working during an annual rebirth broadcast. After all, we'll all get to see it one day. Not only that, we'll even enter the machine in order to become as we once were, as we were born.}
{750}{}{你是说当面？好吧，如果你有先进的科学或技术技能，那么，在你获得许可后，你可能有幸在机器所在的五楼工作。我自己还没看过，但更让我高兴的是，在一个一年一度的重生广播中，我在屏幕上看到了它。毕竟，总有一天我们都会看到的。不仅如此，我们甚至会进入机器，以成为我们曾经是，因为我们出生。}

#{800}{}{The rebirth process has been put on hold because of the traitor, the Thirteenth, currently the last reborn. He left us. And his treachery put us all in jeopardy.

Even if this tremendous gift has been bestowed unto an undeserving person, it's still a marvel to watch the machine at work.}
{800}{}{因为叛徒，第十三个，目前是最后一个重生，重生的过程被搁置了。他离开了我们。他的背叛把我们都置于危险之中。所以我们现在主要集中在抓捕他。但是这台电脑里有他的重生记录，所以你可以看看。即使这一巨大的礼物已经送给了一个不值得的人，它仍然是一个奇迹，看机器在工作。}

#{850}{}{He used to be a good soldier, courageously fighting for the Rebirth. But his own rebirth got into his head, all of a sudden he thought he was better than us because unlike the rest of us he was cured. His leaving presents a risk for us by itself.

I just can't fathom that. He must be crazy.}
{850}{}{他曾经是个好战士，勇敢地为重生而战。但是他自己的重生进入了他的头脑，突然他认为他比我们好，因为他不像我们其他人被治愈了。他的离开本身就给我们带来了危险。我们有很多敌人，你肯定知道，如果他们知道这台机器，只会让我们的情况更糟。最糟糕的是他密谋反对我们，要我们被毁灭。我就是搞不懂。他一定是疯了。}

#{900}{}{It's obvious that letting them outside would be too much of a risk. And so they continue serving the Rebirth within the walls of this complex. They pass on their old duties to the others while assuming new, more honorable duties themselves, that most of us aren't even allowed to know about. And thus it shall be until the day of rebirth for all of us comes.}
{900}{}{很明显，让他们出去太冒险了。所以他们继续在这个建筑群的墙壁里为重生服务。他们把旧的职责传给别人，同时自己承担新的、更光荣的职责，这是我们大多数人都不知道的。就这样，直到我们所有人重生的那一天到来。}

#{950}{}{Who is to be reborn and who is to wait? Can you even decide anything like that in a just manner? It wouldn't be right to cure some while others have to keep suffering. When the right day comes, it'll bring rebirth for all. If you can't believe that, at least believe that if the people who're fighting us knew that there were "pure" humans among us, it would rouse too many questions and suspicions. Until they'd finally find out what it is we're trying to do here and that would be an impulse for them to redouble their efforts to destroy us in their hatred.}
{950}{}{谁将重生，谁将等待？你能公正地做出这样的决定吗？当其他人不得不忍受痛苦时，治愈一些人是不对的。当正确的一天到来，它将为所有人带来重生。如果你不能相信这一点，至少要相信，如果与我们战斗的人知道我们中间有“纯洁”的人类，那会引起太多的质疑和怀疑。直到他们最终发现我们在这里要做什么，这将是他们加倍努力摧毁我们在他们的仇恨冲动。}

#{1100}{}{This used to be a research complex for Vault-Tec, the company that built vaults, among other things. The main focus of research here was on biology, which is why they made the machine that is our salvation. According to records the complex was sealed when the missiles were fired and so it was fully preserved.}
{1100}{}{这曾经是Vault Tec的一个研究中心，这家公司建造了金库等。这里的研究主要集中在生物学上，这就是为什么他们制造了拯救我们的机器。根据记录，导弹发射时，这个建筑群是密封的，所以它被完全保存了下来。}

#{1150}{}{I don't like to think about that. You know, the automatic sealing of the complex meant death for all of them. After the sealing, a nerve agent was released into the air that killed everyone. That's why I'm glad I wasn't among the first arrivals here; because I didn't have to look at corridors full of dead bodies. That's how Vault-Tec worked. The equipment was more valuable to them than the people who, if sealed in here, could have damaged it. It's all very strange... there are those among us who were irradiated because of poor vault construction. And the company that caused their suffering at the same time developed a machine which can save them.}
{1150}{}{我不想去想这个。你知道，大楼的自动密封意味着所有人的死亡。密封后，一种神经毒剂被释放到空气中，导致所有人死亡。这就是为什么我很高兴我不是第一批来到这里的人；因为我不必看满是尸体的走廊。Vault Tec就是这样工作的。这些设备对他们来说比那些如果密封在这里可能会损坏它的人更有价值。这一切都很奇怪。。。我们当中有些人因为拱顶结构不好而受到辐射。同时造成他们痛苦的公司开发了一种可以拯救他们的机器。}

#{1200}{}{Unfortunately, I'm talking about people. Those without radiation burns, healthy, non-mutated people. The machine regenerates, renews, you could say it revitalizes, but it doesn't create anything. Before entering the machine one has to undergo operations which replace their organs that are too damaged with new ones and missing muscle with new muscle. And for that we need humans, those that reject and try to exterminate us, to help us at least in this albeit involuntary way.}
{1200}{}{不幸的是，我说的是人。没有辐射烧伤的，健康的，没有变异的人。机器再生，更新，你可以说它恢复了活力，但它没有创造任何东西。在进入机器之前，一个人必须接受手术，用新的器官替换他们受损太多的器官，用新的肌肉替换缺失的肌肉。为此，我们需要人类，那些拒绝并试图消灭我们的人，至少以这种尽管是非自愿的方式来帮助我们。}

#{1250}{}{No I don't. It truly isn't right, just like it isn't right that we're suffering without reason and neither is it right that those luckier than us are damning us on account of our suffering. If humans don't want to respect us, we can't respect them. Once we're all reborn, hopefully we'll be better people than they were. We'll live knowing others had to pay for our lives and knowing how it felt to be ghouls. Perhaps we'll be more tolerant to each other and everybody else too.}
{1250}{}{不，我不知道。这确实是不对的，就像我们无缘无故地受苦是不对的，那些比我们幸运的人因为我们的痛苦而诅咒我们也是不对的。如果人类不想尊重我们，我们就不能尊重他们。一旦我们都重生了，希望我们能成为比以前更好的人。我们将活在知道别人必须为我们的生命付出代价和知道作为僵尸的感觉。也许我们会对彼此更宽容，对其他人也更宽容。}

You suffer the pains of your body, you are burdened by memories of loved ones long gone, and the world hates you for all that without good reason. And your life is many times longer than it should be. Perhaps so you can enjoy your suffering to its fullest extent. No wonder someone like that isn't capable to believe in something better, in any happier future and loses all hope. But in spite of that the Savior has given us hope. Real tangible hope. And he personifies that hope perfectly. Whether he is a man or a God is irrelevant. We can never revere him the way he would deserve.}

{1800}{}{还没有一个僵尸想离开。这个地方是美好生活的真正希望。迟早每个人都会看到的。我也怀疑了很久。我出生在战前，经历过很多邪恶。但当我看到这里发生的事情，听到救世主的消息，那也许是战后我第一次真正感到高兴。}

#{2250}{}{You mean in person? Well, if you have advanced scientific or technical skills, then, after you're cleared, you might be lucky enough to work on the fifth floor where the machine is located. I haven't seen it myself, but more delightful for me was seeing it on a screen working during an annual rebirth broadcast. After all, we'll all get to see it one day. Not only that, we'll even enter the machine in order to become as we once were, as we were born.}
{2250}{}{你是说当面？好吧，如果你有先进的科学或技术技能，那么，在你获得许可后，你可能有幸在机器所在的五楼工作。我自己还没看过，但更让我高兴的是，在一个一年一度的重生广播中，我在屏幕上看到了它。毕竟，总有一天我们都会看到的。不仅如此，我们甚至会进入机器，以成为我们曾经是，因为我们出生。}

#{2350}{}{She used to be a good soldier, courageously fighting for the Rebirth.

I just can't fathom that. She must be crazy.}
{2350}{}{她曾经是个好战士，勇敢地为重生而战。但是她自己的重生进入了她的脑海，突然她认为她比我们好，因为她不像我们其他人被治愈了。她的离开本身就给我们带来了危险。我们有很多敌人，你肯定知道，如果他们知道这台机器，只会让我们的情况更糟。最糟糕的是她密谋反对我们，想要我们被毁灭。我就是搞不懂。她一定是疯了。}

#{2400}{}{There are those here who almost worship him as such. Don't you understand he achieved the unachievable? You know yourself how it is to be a ghoul. You suffer the pains of your body, you are burdened by memories of loved ones long gone, and the world hates you for all that without good reason. And your life is many times longer than it should be. Perhaps so you can enjoy your suffering to its fullest extent. No wonder someone like that isn't capable to believe in something better, in any happier future and loses all hope. But in spite of that the Savior has given us hope. Real tangible hope. And he personifies that hope perfectly. Whether he is a man or a God is irrelevant. We can never revere him the way he would deserve.}
{2400}{}{这里有些人几乎是这样崇拜他。你不明白他实现了无法实现的目标吗？你知道自己是个僵尸。你承受着身体的痛苦，你背负着对逝去已久的亲人的回忆，世界无缘无故地恨你。你的生命比它应该的要长很多倍。或许你可以尽情享受你的痛苦。难怪这样的人不能相信更好的东西，在任何更幸福的未来，失去所有的希望。尽管如此，救主还是给了我们希望。实实在在的希望。他完美地将这种希望人格化。他是人还是神都无关紧要。我们永远不能像他应得的那样尊敬他。}

#{3400}{}{By material I unfortunately mean people. Those without radiation burns, healthy, non-mutated people. The machine regenerates, renews, you could say it revitalizes, but it doesn't create anything. Before entering the machine one has to undergo operations which replace their organs that are too damaged with new ones and missing muscle with new muscle. And for that we need humans, those that reject and try to exterminate us, to help us at least in this albeit involuntary way.}
{3400}{}{不幸的是，我指的是人。没有辐射烧伤的，健康的，没有变异的人。机器再生，更新，你可以说它恢复了活力，但它没有创造任何东西。在进入机器之前，一个人必须接受手术，用新的器官替换他们受损太多的器官，用新的肌肉替换缺失的肌肉。为此，我们需要人类，那些拒绝并试图消灭我们的人，至少以这种尽管是非自愿的方式来帮助我们。}

#{3450}{}{This used to be a research complex for Vault-Tec, the company that built vaults, among other things.

#{3550}{}{Driven by his will to become a normal human again he discovered this place and the machine within. His determination was such that he operated on himself, implanting healthy organs and flesh that were stored here for experimental purposes, then he entered the machine and has been reborn.

So when other ghouls came here he started what would fulfill this greater purpose - the Rebirth.}
