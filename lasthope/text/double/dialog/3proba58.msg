### {107}{}{Well, being a farmer, I tend to my brahmin and sell them to make some money. Let me tell you, it's so hard these days to earn even a modest living. Mantis raids, cattle thieves... I must work all day and night, and even then I can't manage to cover the losses. My brahmin headcount keeps going down, can't get any worse than this...}
{107}{}{嗯，作为一个农民，我照顾我的婆罗门，把它们卖掉赚些钱。让我告诉你，现在连微薄的生活都很难挣。螳螂袭击，偷牛贼。。。我必须夜以继日地工作，即使那样我也无法弥补损失。我的婆罗门人数一直在下降，再糟糕不过了。。。 -- Well, being a farmer, I tend to my brahmin and sell them to make some money. Let me tell you, it's so hard these days to earn even a modest living. Mantis raids, cattle thieves... I must work all day and night, and even then I can't manage to cover the losses.

### {111}{}{Those small bastards like to come out of their holes and tunnels and prowl around, mostly during night time. A couple of times they left my cowshed almost empty. I tried everything to drive them off, but only managed to get attacked and earn myself some scars. Now it serves as a reminder to use my head, not my shovel...}
{111}{}{那些小混蛋喜欢从洞里和隧道里出来四处游荡，大多是在晚上。有几次他们让我的牛棚几乎空无一人。我想尽一切办法把他们赶走，但最终还是遭到了袭击，给自己留下了一些伤痕。现在它提醒我要用我的头，而不是我的铲子。。。 -- Those small bastards like to come out of their holes and tunnels and prowl around, mostly during night time.

### {115}{}{It's a small community east from here. I used to live there, at least a year, before I moved along with my business. Lots of trouble for such a small place. No traffic, just a few locals and a bunch of gun-obsessed ruffians. Not very pleasant... Some would say it's heading for lawlessness and violence.}
{115}{}{从这里往东是一个小社区。我曾经在那里住过至少一年，后来我开始经营我的生意。这么小的地方真麻烦。没有交通，只有几个当地人和一群持枪歹徒。不是很愉快。。。有人会说，它正在走向无法无天和暴力。 -- It's a small community east from here.

It holds most if not all safe paths I could find in the surrounding areas.}
{119}{}{我听说了发生的事。这是迄今为止最好的该死的消息。随着这些大虫子数量的减少，我可能真的会挣点钱谋生。我想我知道如何报答你。[翻了翻他的包，拿出一张满是灰尘的旧地图。]给你。这张地图对你的帮助和我旅行时的帮助一样大。它包含了我在周围地区能找到的大多数（如果不是全部的话）安全路径。 -- I heard what happened.
