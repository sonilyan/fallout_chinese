#{100}{}{You see a hardened militiaman.}
{100}{}{你看到一个坚强的民兵。}
#{101}{}{You see the Racer.}
{101}{}{你看到赛车手了。}
#{102}{}{You see one of Stryker's minions.}
{102}{}{你看到史崔克的手下了。}
#{110}{}{Yeah?}
{110}{}{是 啊？}
#{111}{}{What next?}
{111}{}{接下来呢？}
#{112}{}{Nothing, just wanted to say hi.}
{112}{}{没什么，只是想打个招呼。}
#{113}{}{Nothing. Bye.}
{113}{}{没有什么。再见。}
#{114}{}{This was a nice chat, but I have to go.}
{114}{}{聊天很愉快，但我得走了。}
#{120}{}{What the fuck do you want? [he groans] Oh god... After the party last night my head's killing me.}
{120}{}{你他妈想要什么？[他呻吟]哦，上帝...昨晚聚会之后，我的头都快累死了。}
#{121}{}{Headache? Then your hero has arrived! [give moonshine]}
{121}{}{头痛？那你的英雄来了！[发私酒]}
#{122}{}{Headache? Then your hero has arrived! [give beer]}
{122}{}{头痛？那你的英雄来了！[给我啤酒]}
#{123}{}{Headache? Then your hero has arrived! [give "Bloody Mary"]}
{123}{}{头痛？那你的英雄来了！[说出“血腥玛丽”]}
#{124}{}{Headache? Then your hero has arrived! [give "Rot Gut"]}
{124}{}{头痛？那你的英雄来了！[说出“腐烂的肠子”]}
#{125}{}{Who are you?}
{125}{}{你是谁？}
#{126}{}{I just have some questions... }
{126}{}{我只是有些问题...}
#{127}{}{Okay, okay, I'm leaving.}
{127}{}{好吧，好吧，我要走了。}
#{130}{}{Would you just fuck off? [he rubs his temples] I'm not in the mood to answer any questions. I can't even think right now.}
{130}{}{你能滚开吗？[他揉了揉太阳穴]我没心情回答任何问题。我现在连想都不敢想。}
#{131}{}{In all my time working for Stryker, this is the first time I've seen someone like you here.}
{131}{}{在我为史崔克工作的所有时间里，这是我第一次在这里见到像你这样的人。}
#{132}{}{That's right. They don't call me the Racer for nothing. When I get going, I don't like to slow down.}
{132}{}{这是正确的。他们不会无缘无故叫我赛车手。当我要走的时候，我不喜欢慢下来。}
#{133}{}{Racer, huh? Well, nice to meet you.}
{133}{}{赛车手？很高兴见到你。}
#{134}{}{Really? You're a lifesaver. Hey, sit down and talk for a bit - I don't like to drink alone.}
{134}{}{真正地？你是救命恩人。嘿，坐下来谈谈-我不喜欢一个人喝酒。}
#{135}{}{[Next]}
{135}{}{[下一步]}
#{136}{}{...so, like I tell all the rookies, get a spare and strike will happen by itself!}
{136}{}{…所以，就像我告诉所有新秀的，得到一个备用和罢工将发生自己！}
#{137}{}{You must a knowledgeable player.}
{137}{}{你一定是个有知识的选手。}
#{140}{}{Tell me about your boss.}
{140}{}{告诉我你老板的事。}
#{141}{}{What are you all doing here?}
{141}{}{你们在这里干什么？}
#{142}{}{You people seem like the real deal. Can I join?}
{142}{}{你们看起来像是真正的交易。我能加入吗？}
#{143}{}{Someone's trying to put pressure on the owner of the Silver Legacy hotel. Do you know anything about that?}
{143}{}{有人想对银色遗产酒店的老板施加压力。你知道吗？}
#{144}{}{Are Stryker's people living in the railway station basement?}
{144}{}{史崔克的人住在火车站地下室吗？}
#{145}{}{Stryker's dead. Why are you still hanging around here?}
{145}{}{史崔克死了。你为什么还在这儿闲逛？}
#{150}{}{Stryker? Big Louie left him in charge of the city five years ago. Stryker's a man with a plan - things are about to change around here, and he's going to be in the center of it.}
{150}{}{史崔克？大路易五年前让他掌管这座城市。史崔克是一个有计划的人――这里的事情即将改变，他将成为其中的核心。}
#{151}{}{This is Stryker's headquarters. It used to be a bowling club, if you can believe that. Stryker's trying to rebuild it, but that's a long way off. When that day comes though - man! This place, full of games and drinks and people having a good time? Just imagine it!}
{151}{}{这是史崔克的总部。如果你能相信的话，那以前是个保龄球俱乐部。史崔克正试图重建它，但那还有很长的路要走。当那一天到来的时候-伙计！这个地方，到处都是游戏和饮料，人们玩得很开心？想象一下吧！}
#{152}{}{You'll have to ask Stryker, but he doesn't take just anybody. You'll need someone to vouch for you. And, uh, if you do get in... Just a word of advice. Never, *ever* contradict him.}
{152}{}{你得问问史崔克，但他不带任何人。你需要有人为你担保。如果你真的进去了...只是一句忠告。永远不要反驳他。}
#{153}{}{Probably that prick Thompson again. He really wants that place, but the owner's dead-set on staying independent. He can't hold out forever, though... It's just a matter of who finally gets through to him.}
{153}{}{可能又是那个混蛋汤普森。他真的很想去那个地方，但店主一心想保持独立。但他不能永远坚持下去...只不过是谁最后能打通他的电话。}
#{154}{}{Beats me. Stryker only tells us what we need to know. But they could be - we've got a lot of sticks in the fire, if you know what I mean.}
{154}{}{打败了我。史崔克只告诉我们需要知道的。但他们可能是-我们有很多棍子在火里，如果你知道我的意思的话。}
#{155}{}{I... I don't know. At first I thought we could make it without him, but... Some of us have taken off, others have been killed by Thompson's gang. If this keeps up, I'm going to have to leave the city.}
{155}{}{一、 ...我不知道。一开始我以为没有他我们可以做到，但是...我们中的一些人已经起飞，其他人被汤普森的帮派杀害。如果这样下去，我就得离开这个城市了。}
#{160}{}{Do you know Solomon?}
{160}{}{你认识所罗门吗？}
#{161}{}{Mmmmmaybe. Why?}
{161}{}{嗯，也许吧。为什么？}
#{162}{}{Someone in the El Dorado basement recommended him to me. He said you could help me find him.}
{162}{}{埃尔多拉多地下室的人向我推荐了他。他说你可以帮我找到他。}
#{163}{}{You mean the little guy? Okay, that changes things. Yeah, I can hook you up. We don't need him anymore, but we're still in touch.}
{163}{}{你是说那个小家伙？好吧，这改变了一切。是的，我可以帮你接电话。我们不再需要他了，但我们仍然保持联系。}
#{164}{}{We?}
{164}{}{我们？}
#{165}{}{Uh... Never mind that. Not important. I can set you up with Solomon, but you have to do me a favor first.}
{165}{}{Uh...没关系。不重要。我可以帮你介绍所罗门，但你得先帮我个忙。}
#{166}{}{What do you need?}
{166}{}{你需要什么？}
#{167}{}{Alright, here goes. Our last party was at Mom's nightclub. I got drunk and, uh... I might have got a little rowdy. See, I don't *exactly* remember what happened. The point is, I'm now banned. Unfortunately, I left my mirrored sunglasses there, and I want them back. I need you to take my ticket, go to the club, and get my sunglasses back.}
{167}{}{好了，开始吧。我们上次聚会是在妈妈的夜总会。我喝醉了，呃...我可能有点吵闹。看，我不太记得发生了什么。关键是，我现在被禁了。不幸的是，我把带镜子的太阳镜放在那里了，我想把它们拿回来。我要你拿着我的票，去俱乐部，把我的太阳镜拿回来。}
#{168}{}{I'll think about it.}
{168}{}{我会考虑的。}
#{169}{}{About that favor... }
{169}{}{关于那个人情...}
#{170}{}{Yeah?}
{170}{}{是 啊？}
#{171}{}{Why are you asking me and not your boss?}
{171}{}{你为什么问我而不是你老板？}
#{172}{}{Oh, okay, I'll manage, somehow.}
{172}{}{哦，好吧，我会设法的。}
#{173}{}{[He winces] Oooh... That's kind of a sensitive matter. Stryker wants the club and is trying to negotiate with Mom, so he's not happy with my, uh, whatever I did. I'd prefer not to remind him. You see what I'm getting at?}
{173}{}{[他畏缩]哦...这是个敏感的问题。史崔克想要加入俱乐部，正试图和妈妈谈判，所以他对我的，呃，不管我做了什么都不满意。我不想提醒他。你明白我的意思吗？}
#{174}{}{Yeah, I see. Well, back to work.}
{174}{}{是的，我明白了。好吧，回去工作吧。}
#{175}{}{I've got your sunglasses.}
{175}{}{我有你的太阳镜。}
#{176}{}{Fuckin' A! [he puts on the glasses and looks around] A deal's a deal. I'll get in touch with Solomon and let him know you're trustworthy. He works in a building out behind the El Dorado, next to the Cotton Club. Tell him I sent you.}
{176}{}{他妈的！[他戴上眼镜环顾四周]说定了。我会和所罗门联系，让他知道你是值得信赖的。他在埃尔多拉多后面的一栋楼里工作，紧挨着棉花俱乐部。告诉他是我派你来的。}
#{177}{}{Great.}
{177}{}{伟大的。}
#{180}{}{What's that bunker entrance across the street, in the park?}
{180}{}{街对面公园里的碉堡入口是什么？}
#{181}{}{Some pre-war bomb shelter. A few hundred people could probably live there for a few days at a time, but there's not much need for it now.}
{181}{}{一些战前的防空洞。几百人可能一次能在那里住上几天，但现在不太需要了。}
#{182}{}{Why's it locked?}
{182}{}{为什么锁上了？}
#{183}{}{I don't know. Stryker's idea. He probably thinks he can find someone that can crack the door code.}
{183}{}{我不知道。史崔克的主意。他可能认为他能找到破解密码的人。}
#{184}{}{Door code?}
{184}{}{门代码？}
#{185}{}{Yeah, there's some door hooked up to a terminal that we just can't crack. Thing's like a fucking vault. It's probably the command center for the shelter - you know what that means?}
{185}{}{是的，有些门连着一个终端，我们就是打不开。就像他妈的避难所。可能是避难所的指挥中心-你知道这是什么意思吗？}
#{186}{}{What?}
{186}{}{什么？}
#{187}{}{It means it'd have a radio station, a power source, surveillance systems, medical supplies, all that stuff. Those pre-war folks didn't fuck around when it came to their shelters. But we'll never know for sure until Stryker finds someone that can either crack the terminal or blow the door down.}
{187}{}{这意味着它会有一个无线电台，一个电源，监控系统，医疗用品等等。那些战前的人在他们的庇护所里可不是到处乱搞的。但在史崔克找到一个既能破解航站楼又能把门炸开的人之前，我们永远无法确定。}
#{188}{}{It looks like you scavenged some things from there already.}
{188}{}{看起来你已经从那里捡了些东西。}
#{189}{}{Yeah, Stryker pulled out all the surveillance systems we could get to and wired them up around the headquarters. They work great, though the guys get tired of staring at monitors all day. Honestly, we don't really need them, but sometimes Stryker keeps a record of his meetings in case he needs dirt on someone. But, uh, don't tell anyone I said that.}
{189}{}{是的，史崔克调出所有我们能找到的监控系统，把它们连接到总部周围。他们工作得很好，尽管他们厌倦了整天盯着显示器看。老实说，我们并不真的需要他们，但有时史崔克会把他的会议记录下来，以防他需要别人的消息。但是，呃，别告诉任何人我说的。}
#{190}{}{How can I get the key to the bunker?}
{190}{}{我怎样才能拿到地堡的钥匙？}
#{191}{}{Talk to Stryker. He'll probably give it to you for a few bucks. After all, if we can't get into the command center, it's not like you're going to be able to.}
{191}{}{和史崔克谈谈。他可能会花几块钱给你。毕竟，如果我们进不了指挥中心，你也不会进。}
#{192}{}{Okay.}
{192}{}{可以。}
#{1130}{}{Would you just fuck off? [he rubs his temples] I'm not in the mood to answer any questions. I can't even think right now.}
{1130}{}{你能滚开吗？[他揉了揉太阳穴]我没心情回答任何问题。我现在连想都不敢想。}
#{1133}{}{Racer, huh? Well, nice to meet you.}
{1133}{}{赛车手？很高兴见到你。}
#{1175}{}{I've got your sunglasses.}
{1175}{}{我有你的太阳镜。}
