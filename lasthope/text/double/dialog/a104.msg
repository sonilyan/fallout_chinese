{100}{}{Hey there, stranger. What brings you to our town?}
{101}{}{I'm just passing by. Say, what is this place?}
{102}{}{Well, I'm a mere traveler. Who are you?}
{103}{}{Sorry, no time to talk.}
#place...
{104}{}{This is our caravan office, if you can call it that. You see, caravans used to go from town to town, trading
 goods and all that... But times aren't good for us anymore. Raiders and bandits gave us so much trouble in the past we
 were forced to stop organizing caravans.}
{105}{}{I see. How's the situation now?}
#
{106}{}{It's not getting any better. Well, some of my men are traveling across the wasteland, selling our goods for
 equipment, food... Enough to stay in business. Also, bandits disguised as caravans used to get into towns... So, many of
 them were forced to forbid trading with caravans. Slowly over time, caravans stopped to exist altogether. Some of them
 are still traveling the wasteland though, pushing their luck, hoping for better days. [Laughs.]}
{107}{}{Say, which towns have you visited lately?}
{108}{}{Nice talking to you. I have to go now.}
#which towns
{109}{}{I usually check Philton. Most of our stock goes there. It's a big town with a lot of demand for our ore, but with
 that crazy mayor Donson in charge... better keep away from that guy.}
{110}{}{What can you tell me about Donson?}
#about donson...
{111}{}{Well, I can tell you more than those folks. Because Donson keeps everything under his control. And there's a
 rumor going round that he's responsible for some missing people. [He raises an eyebrow.] Anyway, it's not my job to
 look for the truth, frankly, I don't care as long as I get paid.}
{112}{}{Good for you, let me ask you something.}
{113}{}{Thanks for your time. See you later.}
#after 110...
{114}{}{Where's Philton located?}
#
{115}{}{It's right here on your map, let me show you. [He marks the location on your map.]}
{116}{}{Thanks.}
#traveler...
{117}{}{I'm Leny, caravan manager. I also run this place. Something I can help you with?}
{118}{}{What can you tell me about this place?}
{119}{}{Is there any caravan ready to go?}
{120}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{121}{}{No, nothing right now.}
#ask something...
{122}{}{Yes, how can I help you stranger?}
#any caravan ready...
{123}{}{Not exactly. You see, we used to have caravans but for a long time we had many problems with bandits. So,
 we were forced to cancel many shipments that were more vulnerable to sudden attacks. We tried everything, it just
 doesn't seem to work.}
{124}{}{Sorry to hear that, so how are things going nowadays?}
{125}{}{Well, I have to go now.}
#again...
{126}{}{I've seen you before, right? So, what do you want?}
{127}{}{What can you tell me about this place?}
{128}{}{Who are you?}
{129}{}{Anything interesting going on lately?}
{130}{}{Nothing.}
#interesting...
#deathclaws threat...
{131}{}{Well, there are a few things going on but nothing interesting. Some deathclaws are wandering around the city,
 my cousin here saw them too. I bet these things aren't here just for the fun. You know what they say, where there's a
 hunter, there's prey. Jerry, the local sheriff, could tell you more...}
{132}{}{Thanks, anything else?}
#
{133}{}{Nothing I can remember, see you later.}
{134}{}{Sure thing, Leny.}
#the mine problem, Jerry dead...
{135}{}{We have an old mine here in town, you have probably heard about it. The problem is that it's too old and
 many workers refuse to work down there. While the town has to keep producing goods for trade, the question
 remains, is it safe to work there anymore? So this town has a big dilemma, should we keep the mine running for a few
 more years until we construct a new mining site or... It's not gotten easier since our most trusted citizen Jerry is gone...
 may he rest in peace... he knew what to do...}
{136}{}{He was a good man, thanks for your time.}
#deathclaws gone
{137}{}{Well, looks like those deathclaws won't be bothering us, at least for a while I think. It's just... [sighs.] Too
 bad Jerry didn't make it. I'm going to miss all of them. Like I said, we have an old mine here in town, big dilemma, a
 lot of unhappy miners...}
{138}{}{It's a tough one, anything else?}
#dude stealing from bookshelf...
{139}{}{What was that?! Get away from there!}
{140}{}{That's it, guards!}
