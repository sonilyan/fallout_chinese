{100}{}{My man told me some kid was asking around about working for Aston. Now I see who he was talking about.
 What makes you think you're better than any other wanderer that knocks on my door every single day, looking for a
 job... [smiles]. All right, talk.}
{101}{}{Who are you?}
{102}{}{Got any job for me?}
{103}{}{Sorry, I'll be going now.}
#who are you...
{104}{}{I'm Aston, but you should know that by now. Either you're messing with me or just too stupid to
 remember... but I guess you're both. Either way, I'm in charge here. So if you want some work... You talk to me!}
{105}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
#job...
{106}{}{Let me tell you something first. [Clears throat]... I want only hard working people here. You mess with me...
 all you can earn is a free funeral. So what kind of job you think you can handle?}
{107}{}{Whatever job you can offer. I can handle myself.}
{108}{}{Well, I heard you, and I think I'll be back later.}
#
{109}{}{Alright, tough guy! I have something for you. Listen, this ain't something for fuckin' retards, like walking the
 dog... If you mess this up, better save one bullet for yourself! As I was saying, this one will test your limits. Well, are
 you up for the challenge?}
{110}{}{I sure am, tell me about it.}
{111}{}{I think this is not my call, I'm out of here.}
#out of here...
{112}{}{Somehow I knew you were going to back down, retarded chickenshit! Get the fuck out before I eat you for dinner!}
{113}{}{Eat some lead, asshole!}
{114}{}{Damn... I'm going.}
#tell me about it...
{115}{}{Look... Just below this office, there is a network of sewer canals. Yesterday morning when I came here, there
 was this terrible smell coming from down there even though the manhole was covered. I sent my men and they
 discovered a pile of dead bodies ripped to shreds. They said some damn animal is still trapped inside, but my men just
 won't go any further. They need help to kill this creature, apparently it's two meters tall with huge razor sharp claws...
 The best way for me to find out what exactly this thing is, includes that you kill it and bring it here, nothing more.
 Now go down there, my men are waiting.}
{116}{}{Phew, what an encouraging speech.}
#
{117}{}{I will feel much safer if you kill the damn thing, anytime soon.}
{118}{}{When you kill it, bring it here.}
#
{119}{}{[Closely examines the dead critter.] Damn, it's ugly! How the fuck did you manage to kill this thing? I guess,
 you got lucky, good for you kid. Here's $500 for the trouble. Now, about this hideous creature. [Gently kicks it.] I'm
 gonna make a souvenir out of it. Yeah, it's going to stand inside by the front door and scare off any unsuspecting
 visitor. [Laughs hysterically.]}
{120}{}{Hm, good idea.}
#
{121}{}{Come back tomorrow for another job. And don't be fuckin' late, I hate that!}
{122}{}{Sure thing.}
#
{123}{}{I told you... Come back later.}
#
{124}{}{So, what can I do for you?}
#
{125}{}{Alright, I see you managed to show up on time. I have another job, interested?}
{126}{}{Lets hear about it.}
{127}{}{Later.}
#
{128}{}{Come back some other time.}
{129}{}{I'm busy now.}
{130}{}{Don't bother me now.}
{131}{}{It's still too early in the morning.}
#lets hear
{132}{}{You see that little generator in the courtyard... That's mine, and guess what? It's distributing electricity to
 the whole city. It runs smoothly but needs to be refueled every few years. I calculated the amount of remaining fuel and
 the numbers told me that we have a few months before this thing shuts down. So I figure this would give us enough
 time to find the materials for the replacement rods.}
{133}{}{What are those "replacement rods"?}
#
{134}{}{[Smiles.] You know, fuel. This generator is designed specifically for generating power from uranium ore rods.
 That "fuel" is clean, unlike coal, but has its side effects, like high radiation. The problem I'm having right now is
 that our supplier of uranium moved to another city, so we were left with no reserves. Your job is to find someone who
 will sell us as much uranium ore as we need.}
{135}{}{I'll see what I can do.}
{136}{}{That sounds too dangerous. What if I refuse to help you?}
#refuse after 136 or 150
{137}{}{Then I will hire someone else for the job and you just fuck off, it's as simple as that, understood!? Don't want
 to see your face again!}
{138}{}{I'll report your sorry ass to the authorities...}
{139}{}{I'm gone.}
#
{140}{}{Leave me alone, shithead!}
{141}{}{Don't you come back again.}
{142}{}{Get away from my property!}
#
{143}{}{We are growing impatient here. Did you manage to do something about that uranium?}
{144}{}{Well, I did what I could...}
{145}{}{No, sir.}
#
{146}{}{It's better than nothing. Well, spit it out then...}
{147}{}{There's a small town to the north, Duntown. They have a power plant, which uses nuclear fuel, and they have
 uranium ore. One of the plant owners, Leonard, is interested in expanding their business to other
 markets. So, it's potentially a good business proposal. He requested that you personally meet him and work out the
 details. He sent you this request form...}
#after 127 later
{148}{}{Seriously, do you want that job or not!? I have no more time for this bullshit!}
{149}{}{Yes, that's why I'm here.}
{150}{}{No, I don't.}
#
{151}{}{Do I have to tell you again what needs to be done?}
{152}{}{Yes, please.}
{153}{}{There's no need for that, I know what to do.}
#
{154}{}{Your job is to find someone who will sell us uranium ore, enough to cover our needs. Keep me informed
 about your progress.}
{155}{}{I'll come back when I have something to report.}
#after 147 answer added
{156}{}{[Smiles.] I see you took your job seriously. Here's your payment... you earned it kid, $1000 for you. Well,
 since I won't be here for some time, don't bother coming. Your services could prove useful sometime in the future. But
 until then, stay out of trouble. Now excuse me, I have a trip to plan...}
{157}{}{[Leave.]}
#
{158}{}{It's about time you showed up... Alright, here's the deal. I'm not interested in your past and all that crap,
 but I've heard that you spent some time in that hellhole north-west of here. So I assume you're familiar with their
 security protocols, right?}
{159}{}{Well, I guess I've seen a bit of it. What's on your mind?}
{160}{}{I was just a prisoner like all those other poor bastards, nothing more...}
{161}{}{I don't like what you're getting at. I'm going now, don't try to stop me.}
#after 159 and 168
{162}{}{I have some unresolved issues with those bastards. They captured one of my informants while traveling near
 Miners Town. Some bandits attacked my man and he managed to fight them off but unfortunately, he was badly hurt
 and these guys just came out of nowhere and took him to their "death camp". They just shoved him in a cell, like some
 fucking animal ...}
{163}{}{This is serious. What can I do?}
#this is serious...
{164}{}{You can bet your ass it's serious! They don't even want to give him any medical attention so I'm forced to send
 somebody to sneak in and help him get up on his feet, [sighs,] at least while I figure how to get him out. I will give
 you $5000 if you help my man. Now is the time to prove your worth, can I count on you?}
{165}{}{Five thousand reasons to go, enough for me.}
{166}{}{Are you serious? Because I'm not going back there...}
#just prisoner/nothing more...
{167}{}{What the... are you fucking deaf? [Talking to his man.] I never thought this kid was that stupid, are we sure
 this is the same person? Hm, let me think... This is your last chance, punk! I've asked you a question, I want an
 answer, now!}
{168}{}{Alright, what do you want?}
{169}{}{Are you calling me stupid? You piece of shit!}
#165...
{170}{}{...and one more thing. You have to find medicine to treat infections. Otherwise it would be a waste of precious
 time. Just keep your mouth shut and you'll be fine, now go.}
{171}{}{I'm on it.}
#floating message job not done...
{172}{}{My man is dying, what are you waiting for!}
{173}{}{Get the medical supplies for my man, he can't wait!}
#job done...
{174}{}{Once again you've proven your worth. Here's your payment... And since you're good with guns, you might
 find this useful. Take it. [Gives you a sub-machine gun.] You must go now, I have a lot of work to do.}
{175}{}{Sure, thanks.}
#not going back...
{176}{}{You don't have much of a choice now. You agreed to do this and now you don't want to... Ah, you're just full
 of crap, get the fuck out of my sight!}
{177}{}{[Leave.]}
{178}{}{Why don't you make me!}
#weapon plans...
{179}{}{Can you make me copies of these? [You show him the plans.]}
#
{180}{}{[Looking at the plans.] Well, you've got some serious stuff there. You know, copying these ain't a walk
 in the park. I'll charge you $6000 for my work, take it or leave it.}
{181}{}{Alright, here's $6000.}
{182}{}{That's too much for me. Some other time then.}
#
{183}{}{Alright, we're done here. Here are your papers. [Hands you the plans.] Nice doing business with you.}
{184}{}{Sure.}
#
{185}{}{I have the money, can you make me a copy of these? [Show him the plans.]}
#123
{186}{}{I'm sorry for the disruption. Can you make me a copy of these? [You show him the plans.]}
{187}{}{My apologies. I have cash, can you make me a copy of these? [Show him the plans.]}
#143
{188}{}{Not yet. Can you make me a copy of these? [You show him the plans.]}
{189}{}{I'm working on it. Can you make me a copy of these? I can pay in cash? [Show him the plans.]}
#after 118, added 20.9.2017, no critter
{190}{}{Did you kill it or what!? I ain't giving you shit until you bring the damn thing here, now go back
 there and do your fucking job!}
{191}{}{Change of plans, time to die!}
{192}{}{Excuse me.}
