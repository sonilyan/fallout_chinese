### {101}{}{[You read the plaque. It says:] John Doe (born 2072) left the vault after the great war. He traveled the mountains in search of his luck. He was down to his last 10mm bullet & half a stimpak, when in 2106 he found a valley of glittering gold. And John Doe decided that this was the place to build his home. The community grew, on the riches of golden rock, but it also brought from the waste a pack of villainous rats. Named mayor in 2116, John Doe promised to make a stand, and in a night of blazing guns, he drove the bandits to the desert and back to empty land. All was well, and all was fine.}
