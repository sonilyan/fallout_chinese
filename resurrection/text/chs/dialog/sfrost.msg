#{553}{}{I see. Gotta go.}
{553}{}{我懂了。我得走了。}
#{600}{}{Some group of motherfuckers simply want to ruin us. I've already run into those bastards a few times... And quite enjoyed sending them to hell! [He grins.] They've really started to get on my nerves.}
{600}{}{一些混蛋只想毁了我们。我已经见过那些混蛋好几次了。。。很高兴把他们送进地狱！[他咧嘴一笑]他们真的开始让我紧张了。}

#{700}{}{[Frost brings you to the bar called Crater.] I've been to a lotsa bars during my travels with caravans, but none of 'em got to me as close as this one. I give you my word. It's true it's a stinking fleahole, but there's a unique magic to it. You're about to find out for yourself soon. So, what shall we start with?}
{700}{}{[弗罗斯特把你带到一个叫“火山口”的酒吧]我和大篷车旅行时去过一个洛萨酒吧，但没有一个比这更接近我。我向你保证。的确，这是个臭烘烘的跳蚤洞，但它有一种独特的魔力。你很快就会发现的。那么，我们从什么开始呢？}

#{751}{}{I'll be right back.}
{751}{}{我马上回来。}
#{800}{}{[You drink the first glass... And another one... And another one... The time flies by, it really does. Your head's swimming, legs are doing what they want... It'll be best to start investigation right now, because you won't be able to hold on for much longer. Frost looks suprisingly just as he did before. It's like the booze had no effect on him.]}
{800}{}{[你喝了第一杯。。。还有一个。。。还有一个。。。时间过得真快。你的头在游动，腿在做他们想做的事。。。最好现在就开始调查，因为你撑不了多久了。弗罗斯特看起来和以前一样令人吃惊。就像酒对他没有影响一样。]}
#{801}{}{Hey, Frost... What do you really think of Frederyk?}
{801}{}{嘿，弗罗斯特。。。你觉得弗雷德里克怎么样？}
#{802}{}{How, how's it with them raiders?}
{802}{}{怎么了，突袭者怎么样了？}
#{850}{}{You 'bviously can't hold your liquor, eh? [He laughs.] Frederyk's fine. He pays well and doesn't order me around much. That's all I need from my boss so I don't pay more attention to him. What else do you need to know?}
{850}{}{你真是憋不住你的酒，嗯？[他笑了]弗雷德里克很好。他薪水很高，对我的要求也不高。我只需要从老板那里得到这些，这样我就不会多注意他了。你还需要知道什么？}
#{851}{}{Eh. What 'bout them raiders?}
{851}{}{嗯。那袭击者呢？}
#{900}{}{You 'bviously can't hold your liquor, eh? [He laughs.] They're pigs. They attack our caravans like cowardly rats. Whenever they come, there's at least twice as many of 'em as us. I'd shoot all of them if I could. But remember this! They won't get Frost!}
{900}{}{你真是憋不住你的酒，嗯？他们是猪。他们像胆小的老鼠一样袭击我们的商队。不管他们什么时候来，他们的人数至少是我们的两倍。如果可以的话，我会把他们都杀了。但是记住这个！他们不会冻死的！}
#{901}{}{Yeah, suuure! And Frederyk? What about him?}
{901}{}{是啊，苏瑞！弗雷德里克呢？他呢？}
#{950}{}{They're pigs. They attack our caravans like cowardly rats. Whenever they come, there's at least twice as many of 'em as us. I'd shoot all of them if I could. But remember this! They won't get Frost!}
