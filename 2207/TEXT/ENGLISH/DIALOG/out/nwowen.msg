### {10}{}{[You see a very big man. His face never saw a razor, and his butcher's apron has two colors - of fresh blood and dried blood. You try to say something, but he greets you first] Hello. Have we met before?}
{10}{}{[你看到一个很大的男人。他的脸上从来没有见过剃刀，他的屠夫围裙有两种颜色――新鲜血液和干血液。你想说点什么，但他先向你打招呼]你好。我们以前见过面吗？}

### {20}{}{Yes, I'm Owen, the cattle slaughterer. I put Lavash to sleep with my sledgehammer, debone their carcasses, and pass them further along the chain of technological progress, so to say. [he wipes sweat from his forehead with a bloody hand] Phew... So, what do you want, }
{20}{}{是的，我叫欧文，那个屠宰牛的人。可以说，我用大锤让熔岩入睡，给它们的尸体去骨，然后沿着技术进步的链条继续前行。[他用一只沾满鲜血的手擦去额头上的汗水]哇。。。那么，你想要什么，}

### {30}{}{Oh, no big deal, just a dislocated arm. A minor inconvenience. [He twitches in pain] Ooow, goddammit!! I should swing my sledge more careful...}
{30}{}{哦，没什么大不了的，只是手臂脱臼了。一个小小的不便。[他痛苦地抽搐]哦，该死的！！我应该更小心地摆动雪橇。。。}

{34}{999}{你看，欧文，这对我来说不是很有趣。处理好你的问题。}

#Node004
### {40}{}{As I said, my job is to put down an animal and carve the carcass. It's actually not hard - I bash the Lavash's head with that big-ass sledgehammer [he imitates the movement]. Then I take the saw and knives, separate meat from the bone, pick up the steak cuts, and put them away from the rest. A dirty job, I should say, but most of the time - I love it! [he kindly smiles]}
{40}{}{正如我所说，我的工作是放下一只动物并雕刻尸体。这其实并不难――我用那把大屁股大锤砸拉瓦什的头[他模仿动作]。然后我拿起锯子和刀子，把肉和骨头分开，拿起切好的牛排，把它们和其他的分开。我应该说，这是一项肮脏的工作，但大多数时候――我喜欢它！[他和蔼地微笑]}
### {41}{008}{Care to demonstrate? Bashing a head with a sledge must be very spectacular.}
{41}{008}{想演示一下吗？用雪橇撞击头部一定非常壮观。}

#Node005
### {50}{}{Community? What a word! Did you overhear that somewhere? [widely smiling, Owen slightly pushes you in the shoulder with the back of his palm] I'd put it like that - we are a family. New World Order supplies the whole Radius with meat! Without us, everyone would eat each other already.}
{50}{}{社区多好的一个词！你是在什么地方无意中听到的吗？[笑容满面，欧文用手掌轻轻地推你的肩膀]我会这么说的――我们是一家人。新世界秩序为整个Radius供应肉类！如果没有我们，每个人都会互相吃掉。}
### {51}{004}{Remind me about your role in this "family", please.}
{51}{004}{请提醒我你在这个“家庭”中的角色。}

### {601}{}{[you glance over Owen's hand. Everything seems better than you thought, so, knowingly turning the patient's limb, you successfully put the bone into a joint!] OW! Damn!

{601}{}{[你瞥了一眼欧文的手。一切似乎都比你想象的要好，所以，你故意转动病人的肢体，成功地将骨头放入了关节！]哇！该死[欧文停顿了一下，慢慢地移动他的手臂。他灿烂的笑容变得更加灿烂]谢谢！你真的很擅长这种医学！你知道，}

{61}{999}{很高兴能提供帮助，欧文。小心！}
### {603}{}{[You clumsily grab the butcher by the hand, inflicting him severe pain, which leads to you getting punched in the face with an elbow. You are lucky it wasn't hard] God frigging damn it! I told you, it hurts! Are you trying to completely drive me crazy?!}
{603}{}{[你笨拙地抓住屠夫的手，给他带来剧烈的疼痛，导致你的肘部被打在脸上。你很幸运，这并不难]该死的！我告诉过你，很疼！你想把我逼疯吗？！}
### {62}{020}{Okay, I need to think... }
{62}{020}{好吧，我需要思考。。。}
### {63}{007}{Hm... Looks more serious than I thought. Why don't you walk yourself to the doctor? Your legs are still alright.}
{63}{007}{嗯…看起来比我想象的更严重。你为什么不自己去看医生呢？你的腿还可以。}

#Node007
### {70}{}{Don't say it like that! The last thing I need is a problem with my legs. And about the doc, well... We had a little disagreement. It's entirely his fault, by the way! But he won't apologize. As for me, I'm too proud to go to this sadist first. So, don't think it's an option.}
{70}{}{不要那样说！我最不需要的就是我的腿出了问题。关于医生，嗯。。。我们有点意见分歧。顺便说一句，这完全是他的错！但他不会道歉。至于我，我太骄傲了，不能先去找这个虐待狂。所以，不要认为这是一种选择。}

{71}{011}{如果我把医生带到你身边，在这里治好你呢？}

### {80}{}{Oh, }
{80}{}{哦}
### {81}{}{, Of course, I will gladly show it to you sometime! But I'm done for today. If I put down more, they won't be able to process so much meat and it will be spoiled.}
{81}{}{，当然，我很乐意有时间给你看！但我今天完了。如果我多放一些，他们就无法加工这么多肉，而且会变质。}

{106}{}{我不知道。。。[欧文开始用他那只巨大的手抓着下巴沉思]山姆是马克的亲戚，对吧？作为市长，他可能会做得很好。我的意思是，他已经是一位优秀的市长了。。。是的，我想不会那么糟糕。}

#Node012
### {120}{}{Really? [Owen even stops smiling in surprise] This sadist said it himself? [suddenly, Hinder steps into the door. He silently approaches Owen, puts his bag on the ground, and starts examining the butcher's arm. Without saying a word.]}
{120}{}{真正地[欧文惊讶地停止了微笑]这个虐待狂是自己说的吗？[突然，辛德走进门。他默默地走近欧文，把包放在地上，开始检查屠夫的手臂。二话不说。]}
