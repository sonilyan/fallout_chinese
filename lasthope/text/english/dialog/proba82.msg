{100}{}{Stop there. This is a restricted area. State your business!}
{101}{}{Sorry, wrong room.}
{102}{}{You again. I told you this is not a public library!}
{103}{}{My mistake.}
#
{104}{}{I need some of the weapons you got here.}
{105}{}{Quincy told me you have stored some of the weapons I need.}
{106}{}{Do you happen to have weapons in your storage? I'd like to buy some.}
#
{107}{}{What weapons? We don't store any weapons, just survival equipment and food supplies.}
{108}{}{Sorry, wrong info.}
#
{109}{}{Quincy told you? That old bastard! So you just walk in here and ask for weapons!? No, we don't have any
 weapons but I might have something else for you!}
{110}{}{Lets party...}
# weapons you have in your storage
{111}{}{Well, it depends. What do you need?}
{112}{}{Some hunting rifles.}
{113}{}{Nothing at the moment.}
#
{114}{}{Hunting rifles, yes... We have some. Tell you what, I will give you a nice price... Ten rifles for, say, $4500?}
#
{115}{}{Sounds good, here's the money.}
{116}{}{I'll come back with the money.}
#
{117}{}{Do you have the money?}
#
{118}{}{OK. First locker from the right, take what you need. [Counts the money, mumbling to himself]... nice...}
{119}{}{Thanks.}
#
{120}{}{Yep, here's the money.}
{121}{}{Not yet.}
#
{122}{}{What else do you want?}
{123}{}{Take your stuff and leave.}
{124}{}{There's no need for you to linger around.}
{125}{}{Keep going.}
{126}{}{Nice to see you, too. Now, get going!}
