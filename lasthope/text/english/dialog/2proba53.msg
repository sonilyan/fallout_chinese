{100}{}{Hello customer, welcome to my store. Wanna take a look at my wares?}
{101}{}{Sure, that's why I'm here.}
{102}{}{Can you modify or upgrade anything that I have?}
{103}{}{Later.}
#modify...
{104}{}{Sorry, I see nothing interesting there. Try bringing me some small arms, you know, like handguns and such.}
{105}{}{Sure, let me ask you something else.}
#
{106}{}{Well I could work on that 10mm pistol you have. Actually, I've got an improved model. Say, you give me
 that one and $350 bucks and I'll sell you this upgraded model I have. Deal?}
{107}{}{OK, here you go...}
{108}{}{Not interested right now.}
#
{109}{}{Thank you. If you need some other stuff, I'm right here. Come back anytime.}
{110}{}{Sure.}
#
{111}{}{Anything else I can help you with?}
{112}{}{Show me your wares.}
