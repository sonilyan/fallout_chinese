### {100}{}{You see Christopher.}
{100}{}{你看到克里斯托弗了。}
### {101}{}{Here is a young military man with a very sad and thoughtful look.}
{101}{}{这是一个年轻的军人，他的表情非常悲伤和体贴。}
### {102}{}{Watch out for super mutants, buddy.}
{102}{}{小心超级变种人，伙计。}

### {200}{}{Hello... E... I didn't know there were civilians on board... e... Welcome aboard.}
{200}{}{你好E.…我不知道船上有平民。。。欢迎登机。}
### {201}{}{It seems that your thoughts are far from here.}
{201}{}{你的想法似乎离这里很远。}
### {202}{}{Exactly. What are you mumbling about? Not in a military way somehow.}
{202}{}{确切地你在喃喃自语什么？不知何故，不是以军事方式。}

### {210}{}{Khym. I've been thinking about home. Junior Paladin Christopher. What can I do for you?}
{210}{}{Khym。我一直在想家。小圣骑士克里斯托弗。我能为你做什么？}
### {211}{}{Sorry for worrying. I'll leave.}
{211}{}{抱歉担心。我要走了。}
### {212}{}{Junior Paladin Christopher. What can I do for you?}
{212}{}{小圣骑士克里斯托弗。我能为你做什么？}

### {220}{}{You were talking about home. Is it far from here?}
{220}{}{你说的是家。离这儿远吗？}
### {221}{}{Lost Hills Bunker. I was born and raised there. It's in California, far northwest of here. Convoys need at best a month to cover this distance. But usually much more.}
{221}{}{Lost Hills地堡。我在那里出生和长大。它在加利福尼亚州，离这里西北很远。车队最多需要一个月才能走完这段路程。但通常要多得多。}
### {222}{}{Tell me about life in the bunker.}
{222}{}{告诉我地堡里的生活。}
### {223}{}{Bunker, you say? Man was born to live under the sun, not in dark basements.}
{223}{}{你说地堡？人生来就生活在阳光下，而不是黑暗的地下室。}
### {224}{}{I miss the cute dark corridors and dangling wires. There, in the bunker, we had everything we needed - food, energy, even entertainment. And here we are free, but we live in terrible conditions.}
{224}{}{我想念可爱的黑暗走廊和悬挂的电线。在那里，在地堡里，我们有我们需要的一切――食物、能量，甚至娱乐。在这里我们是自由的，但我们生活在恶劣的条件下。}
### {225}{}{Don't you like Arizona?}
{225}{}{你不喜欢亚利桑那州吗？}
### {226}{}{It is not proper for a soldier to whine about a change of location.}
{226}{}{士兵抱怨地点的改变是不合适的。}
### {227}{}{A bare, suffocating desert for miles to Phoenix? No, thanks. I've already seen the sands in California. But there the sands were their own, native. Everything is alien here. And it will remain a stranger to most members of the Brotherhood.}
{227}{}{到凤凰城几英里外的一片光秃秃的、令人窒息的沙漠？不用了，谢谢。我已经在加利福尼亚看过沙子了。但那里的沙子是他们自己的，土生土长的。这里的一切都很陌生。对穆兄会的大多数成员来说，这仍然是一个陌生的问题。}
### {228}{}{You just haven't seen all the local beauties.}
{228}{}{你只是没见过当地所有的美女。}
### {229}{}{So you crawled out of your dark dungeon after all?}
{229}{}{所以你是从黑暗的地牢里爬出来的？}
### {230}{}{I was called up to the punitive squad just at the moment of initiation. And as soon as I received the official title, it was at this time that the Creator's army began to seize the settlements. I was thrown into battles, as if from heaven to hell.}
{230}{}{就在我开始上课的那一刻，我被召入了惩罚小组。当我获得正式头衔时，正是在这个时候，造物主的军队开始占领定居点。我被投入战斗，仿佛从天堂到地狱。}
### {231}{}{Was it hard in battle?}
{231}{}{战斗中艰难吗？}
### {232}{}{What, nerves are too weak for service?}
{232}{}{什么，神经太弱，不能服务？}
### {233}{}{If it wasn't for the training, I wouldn't have been able to stand it. It's easier now. The hardest thing was to survive the loss of brothers in arms. I still keep this photo. Our whole squad before a sortie to the Necropolis. Out of seven people, two survived - me and the commander.}
{233}{}{如果不是训练的话，我是受不了的。现在更容易了。最困难的事情是在失去战友的情况下幸存下来。我还保留着这张照片。我们整个小队在飞往墓地之前。七个人中，有两个人幸存了下来――我和指挥官。}
### {234}{}{Go on.}
{234}{}{继续}
### {235}{}{It's not even worth starting.}
{235}{}{这甚至不值得开始。}
### {236}{}{I pulled him out of the crossfire of super mutants and dragged him into the sewer at the last moment. After that, the mutants hit the hatch with a rocket, and the exit crumbled.}
{236}{}{我把他从超级变种人的交火中拉了出来，在最后一刻把他拖进了下水道。之后，变种人用火箭击中舱门，出口坍塌。}
### {237}{}{I'm really sorry.}
{237}{}{我真的很抱歉。}
### {238}{}{You just got lucky.}
{238}{}{你只是运气好。}
### {239}{}{So the two of us survived. But other groups were already engaged in cleaning up the mutants... I'm sorry, I must have tired you with stories... You're not one of us anyway, you wouldn't understand... And in general, why am I talking to you? Okay, good luck in the desert, or whatever you're doing there.}
{239}{}{所以我们两个活了下来。但其他小组已经在清理变种人。。。对不起，我一定是讲故事累了你。。。无论如何，你不是我们中的一员，你不会理解。。。总的来说，我为什么要和你说话？好吧，祝你在沙漠里好运，或者不管你在那里做什么。}
### {240}{}{Thanks for the story. Sometimes it's worth talking out, even if you're in front of a stranger. Good luck, Paladin.}
{240}{}{谢谢你的故事。有时候，即使你在陌生人面前，也值得说出来。祝你好运，圣骑士。}
### {241}{}{Yes, I don't understand how someone like you is still alive. I hope they'll take you back to the dark bunker.}
{241}{}{是的，我不明白像你这样的人怎么还活着。我希望他们能把你带回黑暗的地堡。}
