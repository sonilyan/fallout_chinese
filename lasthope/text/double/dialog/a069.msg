{106}{}{你好，有什么我能帮你的吗？ -- Hello again, something I can help you with?}
### {107}{}{Not really. If you are looking for entertainment or a place to stay for the night, you're out of luck, this is an industrial town after all. There's a fancy restaurant up north. If you feel hungry or thirsty that's the place for you. Besides that, we don't have any conventional hotels in town. Unless you want to spend a night in one of my two by two rooms. [Laughs.] Just kidding stranger.}
{107}{}{不是。如果你正在寻找娱乐或过夜的地方，那你就运气不好了，毕竟这是一个工业小镇。北边有一家高档餐馆。如果你觉得饿或渴，那就是适合你的地方。除此之外，我们城里没有任何传统的旅馆。除非你想在我的一个两乘两的房间里过夜。[笑]跟陌生人开玩笑。 -- Not really.

### {113}{}{[Looking at his files.] I think I have something for you. One of the locals is having problems with his brahmin. He claims that they refuse to eat and started behaving weird.

{113}{}{[看他的档案。]我想我有东西要给你。一个当地人对他的婆罗门有意见。他声称他们拒绝进食并开始表现怪异。他怀疑有人试图毒害他的婆罗门，但他在水中或他们的食物中找不到任何证据。 -- [Looking at his files.] I think I have something for you.

### {114}{}{So, any other possible cause?}
{114}{}{那么，还有其他可能的原因吗？ -- So, any other possible cause?}
### {115}{}{It could be wild dogs, rats... who knows. After all, I can't blame the man for being overly worried. He invested all his money into this. I promised I would check it out but I'm pretty busy around here so I trust you will help if you can, right?}
{115}{}{可能是野狗、老鼠。。。谁知道呢。毕竟，我不能责怪这个男人过于担心。他把所有的钱都投入到这件事上。我答应过我会去看看，但我在这里很忙，所以如果可以的话，我相信你会帮忙的，对吧？ -- It could be wild dogs, rats... who knows. After all, I can't blame the man for being overly worried.

{120}{}{祝你今天愉快，杰瑞。 -- Have a nice day, Jerry.}
### {121}{}{Alright, his small farm is just east of here. I suspect if anything is happening there, it has to be during the night. So if you head there after sunset you can get a better clue of what's going on.}
{121}{}{好吧，他的小农场就在这里的东边。我怀疑如果那里发生了什么事，那一定是在晚上。因此，如果你在日落后前往那里，你可以更好地了解发生了什么。 -- Alright, his small farm is just east of here. I suspect if anything is happening there, it has to be during the night. So if you head there after sunset you can get a better clue of what's going on.}

### {128}{}{All right.}
{128}{}{好吧 -- All right.}
### {129}{}{Well, one of the locals saw a few deathclaws in the forest, not far from here. That's just another confirmation of my suspicions that deathclaws have a lair in one of the forest caverns.

{129}{}{一个当地人在离这里不远的森林里看到了几只死爪。这再次证实了我的怀疑，即死亡之爪在森林洞穴中有一个巢穴。另一件事是你在城墙内看到的那个小小的死亡爪。这不可能是巧合，所以我们必须面对被占领的直接危险。。。 -- Well, one of the locals saw a few deathclaws in the forest, not far from here.

{132}{}{我们已经决定在事情失控之前处理死亡之爪，也就是说，在我们仍然可以有所作为的时候。我正在召集所有可用的人，所以我想问你是否可以加入我们。我们追捕的每一个死亡爪都有500美元的奖励，以提升人们的精神。我想我们大约一天左右就可以出发了，我希望你在那之前给我一个答案。 -- We have decided to deal with the deathclaws before things get out of control, that is, while we still can make a difference.

{136}{}{我会尽量准时到这里。 -- I'll try to be here on time.}
### {137}{}{Well, little bit of everything. We got ourselves a big ore mine which demands a lot of work. Its tunnels are stretching for kilometers and the only way of transportation through them is by simplified railway system. But very few workers go there because people say it's not worth the risk.

{137}{}{嗯，每样东西都有一点点。我们找到了一个需要大量工作的大矿场。它的隧道绵延数公里，唯一的交通方式是通过简化的铁路系统。但很少有工人去那里，因为人们说这不值得冒险。一些隧道段坍塌，没有任何投资，加上该矿已有200多年的历史，一些人说可能是时候永远关闭它了。 -- Well, little bit of everything.
