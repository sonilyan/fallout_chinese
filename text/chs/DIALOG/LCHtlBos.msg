#{100}{}{You see the Manager.}
{100}{}{你去见经理。}
#{101}{}{You see the hotel Manager. He's busy with blowing the dust off his suit.}
{101}{}{你去见旅馆经理。他正忙着把衣服上的灰尘吹掉。}
#{102}{}{Put the gun down, then we'll talk.}
{102}{}{把枪放下，我们再谈。}
#{109}{}{What?}
{109}{}{什么？}
#{110}{}{Want to book a room?}
{110}{}{想订房间吗？}
#{111}{}{Yes? What do you want?}
{111}{}{对？你想要什么？}
#{112}{}{Let's chat, I'm interested in the situation in the city. What's the news?}
{112}{}{我们聊聊吧，我对城里的情况很感兴趣。有什么消息？}
#{113}{}{Tell me about the city. What's there and where one can go to hang out?}
{113}{}{告诉我这个城市的情况。有什么可以去的地方？}
#{114}{}{It's quite boring in here. No music, no magazines.}
{114}{}{这里很无聊。没有音乐，没有杂志。}
#{115}{}{I need a room to rest. How much is it?}
{115}{}{我需要一个房间休息。多少钱？}
#{116}{}{Continue.}
{116}{}{继续。}
#{117}{}{I don't want anything, I'll go.}
{117}{}{我什么都不要，我去。}
#{118}{}{One more question, if I may...}
{118}{}{还有一个问题，如果我可以。。。}
#{119}{}{All right, thanks.}
{119}{}{好的，谢谢。}
#{120}{}{Well, what can I tell... [Relaxes himself in the chair crossing his fingers on the belly] It's not the coolest place in the region. I'm talking about Vegas and Reno... Although, I've not been there actually, but... Well, I have not much to tell to be honest.}
{120}{}{好吧，我能说什么。。。[在椅子上放松自己，手指交叉着腹部]这不是这个地区最酷的地方。我说的是维加斯和雷诺。。。虽然我没去过，但是。。。老实说，我没什么好说的。}
#{121}{}{Well, the hotel you are in, that's easy and obvious. Across the road from here, the cafe-club "Tin Angel" is shining. It has one cool feature about it - it's Gothic! People love gathering there on holidays, then vomiting at the entrance after a dozen bottles of beer.}
{121}{}{嗯，你住的酒店，很简单，很明显。从这里穿过马路，咖啡馆俱乐部“锡天使”闪闪发光。它有一个很酷的特点-它是哥特式的！人们喜欢在假期聚集在那里，然后在一打啤酒后在入口处呕吐。}
#{122}{}{On the other side of the street there is a trading hall, you can get weapons and other stuff there. Although, if you need medication you should find a pharmacist. He lives to the north, quite close. But the choice of goods there [he makes a vile gesture and shows a wrinkled face] - yuck...}
{122}{}{在街的另一边有一个交易大厅，你可以在那里买到武器和其他东西。不过，如果你需要药物治疗，你应该找个药剂师。他住在北边，很近。但是那里的商品选择[他做了一个卑鄙的手势，露出一张皱巴巴的脸]――恶心。。。}
#{123}{}{There is also the office of our Sheriff Burton nearby. He's in charge of almost everything, he is the chief here. So be cool and don't make troubles - he doesn't like that. It wasn't easy to calm the city down, but he succeeded. Damn, I shudder to think what could have happened without him...}
{123}{}{附近还有我们伯顿警长的办公室。他几乎掌管一切，他是这里的头儿。所以冷静点，别惹麻烦-他不喜欢那样。使城市平静下来并不容易，但他成功了。妈的，我一想到没有他会发生什么就不寒而栗。。。}
#{124}{}{There is also the Director at the Nuka-Cola factory, though. He is an enterprising man, if not for him, like hell we'd have some clean water, lighting and all other technical stuff now. Some even got domestic robots. Isn't that cool? [winks]}
{124}{}{不过，努卡可乐厂也有厂长。他是一个有进取心的人，如果没有他，我们现在会有一些干净的水，照明和所有其他技术的东西。有些甚至有家用机器人。很酷吧？[眨眼]}
#{125}{}{And the factory is quite a thing. It's near here, east on the road. It's only thanks to the factory that the people still know about Salt Lake's existence. All caravans come here mainly for for this liquid joy they produce.}
{125}{}{工厂是个很重要的东西。就在这附近，在东边的路上。正是由于这个工厂，人们才知道盐湖城的存在。所有的商队来这里主要是为了他们产生的这种流动的快乐。}
#{126}{}{By the way, the caravaneers have settled themselves down the street across the square.}
{126}{}{顺便说一句，商队已经在广场对面的街道上安顿下来了。}
#{127}{}{I don't know what else to add. Well, except that the cafe has a couple of slot machines. Have fun. [winks]}
{127}{}{我不知道还有什么要补充的。嗯，除了咖啡馆有几台老虎机。玩得高兴。[眨眼]}
#{128}{}{Ugh. On the square near the entrance there is a gallows stationed. If you like performances you can wait until 4 PM and see a cxomedy. It's not real. It's a sort of amusement - someone plays the role of the hangman, he is accused in complete bollocks and then hung on the rope. Everyone's having fun and till the end of the day people feel great.}
{128}{}{啊。在入口附近的广场上有一架绞刑架。如果你喜欢表演，你可以等到下午4点再去看一场音乐会。这不是真的。这是一种娱乐-有人扮演刽子手的角色，他被指控在完全胡说八道，然后挂在绳子上。每个人都很开心，直到一天结束，人们都感觉很棒。}
#{129}{}{I already told you everything. There's nothing interesting left.}
{129}{}{我已经把一切都告诉你了。没什么有趣的了。}
#{130}{}{[Raises an eyebrow blankly] It's not an entertaining venue. We need peace and quiet in here. And yet... I know, back then, in good hotels, there were coffee tables, for those who have nothing to do during their stay. But the situation with paper publications in Salt Lake fared poorly. The magazines either burned during a nuclear bombing, or decayed from damp climate and poor care. What survived was taken by the Mormons for their library.}
{130}{}{[茫然扬眉]这不是一个娱乐场所。我们这里需要和平和安静。但是。。。我知道，那时候，在好的酒店里，有咖啡桌，供那些在住宿期间无所事事的人使用。但盐湖城纸质出版物的情况却很糟糕。这些杂志要么在核爆炸中被烧毁，要么因潮湿的气候和糟糕的护理而腐烂。幸存下来的东西被摩门教徒拿去当图书馆。}
#{131}{}{[More]}
{131}{}{[更多]}
#{132}{}{Look, you travel often, right? Can you search for these magazines on behalf of me? I can't pay a lot, but you wouldn't be encumbered much by the task to get some magazines, right?}
{132}{}{听着，你经常旅行，对吗？你能帮我找这些杂志吗？我付不了多少钱，但你也不会被买杂志的任务拖累，对吧？}
#{133}{}{I'll try not to forget your request. Now let's change the subject.}
{133}{}{我尽量不忘记你的要求。现在我们换个话题。}
#{134}{}{If I run across anything like that, I'll remember about you. Goodbye.}
{134}{}{如果我遇到那样的事，我会记得你的。再见。}
#{135}{}{I have a comic book.}
{135}{}{我有一本漫画书。}
#{136}{}{It's about the coffee table.}
{136}{}{是关于咖啡桌的。}
#{137}{}{Managed to find something suitable?}
{137}{}{找到合适的了吗？}
#{138}{}{Here's a great comic magazine.}
{138}{}{这是一本很棒的漫画杂志。}
#{139}{}{I have the issue of the erotic magazine "Cat's paw".}
{139}{}{我有一期色情杂志《猫爪》。}
#{140}{}{Not yet, but I wanted to clarify: what kind of magazines are you interested in?}
{140}{}{还没有，但我想澄清一下：你对什么样的杂志感兴趣？}
#{141}{}{Not yet. I shouldn't have asked, let's change the subject.}
{141}{}{还没有。我不该问的，我们换个话题吧。}
#{142}{}{No. Got to get going.}
{142}{}{不，我得走了。}
#{143}{}{Entertaining or erotic. What else can you read before bed... Do you have something like that?}
{143}{}{娱乐的或色情的。你睡前还能读些什么。。。你有这样的东西吗？}
#{144}{}{Exactly what I need! I'll pay for this edition 40$. Agreed?}
{144}{}{正是我需要的！我要为这个版本付40美元。同意？}
#{145}{}{Sure, give the money, now this mag is yours.}
{145}{}{当然，把钱给我，现在这个杂志是你的了。}
#{146}{}{Let me have a think, and you tell me something else.}
{146}{}{让我想一想，你再告诉我点别的。}
#{147}{}{Sounds good, but I have to think about it, see you.}
{147}{}{听起来不错，但我得考虑一下，再见。}
#{148}{}{You gain experience for the delivery of the promised to the customer.}
{148}{}{你在向客户交付承诺的货物方面获得了经验。}
#{149}{}{}

#{150}{}{Room is for renting for a day. For you it will cost }
{150}{}{房间是租一天的。对你来说要花很多钱}
#{151}{}{I'll take the room, here is money.}
{151}{}{我要这个房间，这是钱。}
#{152}{}{I don't have enough money, I will come later.}
{152}{}{我没有足够的钱，我晚点再来。}
#{153}{}{Very well. I'll take you to your room.}
{153}{}{很好。我带你去你的房间。}
#{154}{}{[Follow him]}
{154}{}{[跟着他]}
#{155}{}{You vomited all over the floor! Now who's going to clean this up?!!}
{155}{}{你吐得满地都是！现在谁来清理这个？！！}
#{156}{}{You're well rested and feeling recuperated.}
{156}{}{你休息得很好，感觉很好。}
#{157}{}{ bucks. The next day you can pay again and continue to rest.}
{157}{}{美元。第二天你可以再次付款，继续休息。}
#{200}{}{Well, what's the news... What's the news...}
{200}{}{好吧，有什么消息。。。有什么消息。。。}
#{201}{}{Recently the thief was caught. They tried to catch him for a long time, but he's turned out to be quite a weasel. The Sheriff tried to track him down for two years, but could not. At first, everyone thought that the gang from Provo is doing its dirty work, but they are harsh people, they will rather hit you in the face straight away, and they afraid to enter the city, too. Well, now everything fell into place. Our Sheriff is awesome! Well done, real man!}
{201}{}{最近小偷被抓住了。他们试图抓住他很久了，但结果证明他是个十足的黄鼠狼。警长两年来一直试图追踪他，但未能成功。一开始，大家都以为普罗沃的那帮人在干脏活，但他们都是苛刻的人，他们宁愿直接打你的脸，也不敢进城。好吧，现在一切都安排妥当了。我们的警长太棒了！干得好，真男人！}
#{202}{}{It was recently revealed that some creep robs the machines with Nuka-Cola. Can you imagine? No one understands how. Come on! They come to the machine, and it's just empty! And no traces of tampering visible. How does he do it, I wonder...}
{202}{}{最近有消息称，一些卑鄙小人用努卡可乐抢劫了机器。你能想象吗？没人知道怎么做。加油！他们来到机器前，机器空空如也！没有任何篡改痕迹。他是怎么做到的，我想知道。。。}
#{203}{}{Terrible things are happening. They say, Whip hired a mercenary who massacred a settlement of that trash in Provo. Completely, [makes cutting motion] to the root. It must have been pretty damn difficult. The Sheriff doesn't admit it was done by his order, but it doesn't matter - everyone felt relief when they heard the news.}
{203}{}{可怕的事情正在发生。他们说，维普雇佣了一个雇佣军，他在普罗沃屠杀了一个垃圾定居点。完全地，[做出切割动作]到根部。一定很难。警长不承认这是他的命令，但没关系-每个人听到这个消息都感到欣慰。}
#{204}{}{Gilmore was executed. Quite a bastard he was. It was high time to do it, but nobody wanted to go to Provo where he holed up. Now his redneck cronies should calm down.}
{204}{}{吉尔摩被处决了。他真是个混蛋。是时候做了，但没有人想去普罗沃他藏身的地方。现在他的红领亲信应该冷静下来了。}
#{205}{}{The Nuka-Cola Factory is blooming! There are more and more caravans and the factory opened new vacancies. I can't get enough of it, I lived to see this moment!}
{205}{}{努卡可乐厂开花了！商队越来越多，工厂又开了新的空房。我受够了，我活着看到了这一刻！}
#{206}{}{Whether it was a sabotage, or the clerks of the Nuka-Cola Factory just suck. Well, you see, the Factory has been put on halt. It will be hard without it for the city, I hope that things there will return to normal someday...}
{206}{}{不管是蓄意破坏，还是努卡可乐厂的职员真是糟透了。嗯，你看，工厂已经停工了。如果没有它，城市将很难，我希望那里的事情有一天会恢复正常。。。}
#{207}{}{Now we have a lot more clean water, someone launched an artesian water tower. This is a real sensation!}
{207}{}{现在我们有了更多的清水，有人推出了自流水塔。这真是轰动！}
#{208}{}{Situation with water getting worse and worse. And nobody knows what to do. Every day the visitors foul the toiled, there are sprays even on the walls! I'm so tired of it!}
{208}{}{情况越来越糟。没人知道该怎么办。每天游客们都在污染辛苦劳作的人们，甚至墙上都有喷雾剂！我受够了！}
#{209}{}{Overall, the city blooms, becoming more beautiful and cleaner. Never thought I'd see this. Caravans come more often, more and more people are moving here to live. Salt Lake becomes a really cool city.}
{209}{}{总的来说，城市开花，变得更加美丽和清洁。从没想过我会看到这个。商队来的越来越多，越来越多的人搬到这里来居住。盐湖城变成了一个非常凉爽的城市。}
#{210}{}{Overall, the city languishes. People are leaving, the caravans come less often. It sucks. And I'm still lucky because at least I have a job.}
{210}{}{总的来说，这座城市正在衰退。人们离开了，商队来的次数减少了。太糟糕了。我仍然很幸运，因为至少我有工作。}
#{211}{}{Overall, the situation in the city is the same as before - not good. It's a boring, sleepy place. You can find better.}
{211}{}{总的来说，这个城市的情况和以前一样――不好。这是一个无聊、沉睡的地方。你可以找到更好的。}
