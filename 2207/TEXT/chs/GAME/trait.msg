#  TRAIT DESCRIPTIONS

### {200}{}{Your metabolic rate is twice as normal. This means that you are much less resistant to radiation and poison, but your body heals faster.}
{200}{}{你的新陈代谢率是正常水平的两倍。这意味着你对辐射和毒素的抵抗力要低得多，但你的身体愈合得更快。}
### {201}{}{A little slower, but a little bigger. You may not hit as often, but they will feel it when you do! Your total action points are lowered, but your Strength is increased.}
{201}{}{稍微慢一点，但稍微大一点。你可能不会经常打，但当你打的时候，他们会感觉到的！你的总动作点数会降低，但你的力量会增加。}

{205}{}{如果不注意任何威胁，你可以在转弯时更快地采取行动。这会将你的护甲等级降低到你所穿的等级，但你在战斗回合中的顺序会更快。}
### {206}{}{You swing harder, not better. Your attacks are very brutal, but lack finesse. You rarely cause a good critical, but you always do more melee damage.}
{206}{}{你挥杆更用力，而不是更好。你的攻击非常残忍，但缺乏技巧。你很少造成好的暴击，但你总是造成更多的近战伤害。}
### {207}{}{You don't have time to aim for a targeted attack, because you attack faster than normal people. It costs you one less action point for guns and thrown weapons.}
{207}{}{你没有时间瞄准有针对性的攻击，因为你的攻击速度比普通人快。它花费你少一个行动点的枪和投掷武器。}
### {208}{}{By some strange twist of fate, people around you die violently. You always see the worst way a person can die.}
{208}{}{由于某种奇怪的命运转折，你周围的人会暴毙。你总是看到一个人最糟糕的死亡方式。}
### {209}{}{The good thing is that everyone around you has more critical failures in combat, the bad thing is so do you!}
{209}{}{好的是你周围的每个人在战斗中都有更多的关键失败，坏的是你也是！}
### {210}{}{You studied less-combative skills as you were growing up. Your combat skills start at a lower level, but First Aid, Doctor, Speech and Barter are substantially improved.}

{213}{}{你的身体有很多弱点，但它会记住你的每一个动作和手势。你通过练习来学习技能，但你的主要统计数据都减少了1分。}
### {214}{}{Since you spent more time improving your skills than a normal person, you gain 5 additional skill points per experience level. The tradeoff is that you do not gain as many extra abilities. You gain a perk every four levels.}
