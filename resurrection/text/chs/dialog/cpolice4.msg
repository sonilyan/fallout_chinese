#{100}{}{You see a policeman.}

#{200}{}{You see a Corath policeman.}
{200}{}{你看到一个科拉斯警察。}
#{300}{}{I will not be ridiculed. You will die for your impudence.}
{300}{}{我不会被嘲笑的。你会为你的厚颜无耻而死。}
#{400}{}{He's a protester. Kill him!}
{400}{}{他是个抗议者。杀了他！}
#{401}{}{She's a protester. Kill her!}
{401}{}{她是个抗议者。杀了她！}
#{402}{}{Kill them all!}
{402}{}{把他们全杀了！}
#{403}{}{Strangers always mean trouble.}
{403}{}{陌生人总是意味着麻烦。}
#{500}{}{Hey you! [The policeman points his rifle at you.] What the hell are you doing down here? You're not a miner, and you're not one of Nestor's guards. And you better speak up, or you'll end up like one of them poor corpses. And I'm dead serious.}
{500}{}{嘿，你！[警察用步枪指着你]你到底在下面干什么？你不是矿工，也不是内斯特的守卫。你最好大声说，否则你会像一具可怜的尸体。我是认真的。}
#{501}{}{Please calm down. I'm not looking for trouble. I just want to get out of here as easy as possible.}
{501}{}{请冷静。我不是在找麻烦。我只想尽快离开这里。}
#{502}{}{There is no need for threats. I'm on your side. The miners were revolting and needed to be straightened out. Keeping the peace is your job.}
{502}{}{不需要威胁。我站在你这边。矿工们正在反抗，需要整顿。维持和平是你的工作。}
#{503}{}{What do you mean, me?! It's you who should answer for the bloodbath you've caused here. All the miners were fighting for was a little less misery in their lives!}
{503}{}{你什么意思，我？！你应该为你在这里造成的流血事件负责。矿工们为之奋斗的只是生活中少了一点痛苦！}
#{504}{}{Alright, let me tell you: I tried to convince the miners to start a riot. Their strike didn't cause enough trouble for their boss. Who would have thought I'd be so successful.}
{504}{}{好吧，让我告诉你：我试图说服矿工们发动暴动。他们的罢工没有给老板带来足够的麻烦。谁会想到我会如此成功。}
#{505}{}{Alright, let me tell you: I tried to convince the miners to start a riot. Their strike didn't cause enough trouble for their boss. Who would have thought I'd be so successful.}
{505}{}{好吧，让我告诉你：我试图说服矿工们发动暴动。他们的罢工没有给老板带来足够的麻烦。谁会想到我会如此成功。}
#{506}{}{Nooo that! Dead guy yuck. }
{506}{}{不，那个！死人真恶心。}
#{507}{}{ be good.}
{507}{}{做个好人。}
#{508}{}{Nooo that! Dead guy yuck. }
{508}{}{不，那个！死人真恶心。}
#{509}{}{ be good.}
{509}{}{做个好人。}
#{510}{}{Ugh? [Stroke the muzzle.] Nice a lot!}
{510}{}{呃？[抚摸枪口]非常棒！}
#{550}{}{Ok then. [He gestures to the other policemen to stand down.] Sorry about this, but we have a situation here. Nestor's fucked up and we're neck-deep in this bucket of shit. Riots in the mine are the last thing this city needed.}
{550}{}{那好吧。[他示意其他警察站下来]对不起，我们这里有情况。内斯特搞砸了，我们都陷在这狗屎桶里了。矿场的骚乱是这个城市最不需要的。}
#{551}{}{I can understand that, but was it really necessary to massacre all these miners? You could have just arrested them.}
{551}{}{我能理解，但真的有必要屠杀所有这些矿工吗？你可以逮捕他们。}
#{552}{}{Whatever. Can I go now?}
{552}{}{无论什么。我现在可以走了吗？}
#{600}{}{It's nice to talk to someone who appreciates the seriousness of this situation. [He gestures to the other policemen to stand down.] Nestor's fucked up and we're neck-deep in this bucket of shit. Riots in the mine are the last thing this city needed.}
{600}{}{很高兴能和一个了解事态严重性的人交谈。[他示意其他警察站下来]内斯特搞砸了，我们都陷在这桶屎里了。矿场的骚乱是这个城市最不需要的。}
#{601}{}{You're absolutely right. Can I go now?}
{601}{}{你完全正确。我现在可以走了吗？}
#{650}{}{Watch your mouth, stranger. We did what was necessary. The miners started an all-out riot. Nestor might be a useless idiot, having let things go this far, but that doesn't give anyone the right to break the law.}
{650}{}{小心你的嘴，陌生人。我们做了必要的事。矿工们发动了一场全面的暴动。内斯特也许是个没用的白痴，他让事情发展到现在，但这并没有给任何人违法的权利。}
#{651}{}{Watch your mouth, stranger. We did what was necessary. The miners started an all-out riot. Nestor might be a useless idiot, having let things go this far, but that doesn't give anyone the right to break the law.}
{651}{}{小心你的嘴，陌生人。我们做了必要的事。矿工们发动了一场全面的暴动。内斯特也许是个没用的白痴，他让事情发展到现在，但这并没有给任何人违法的权利。}
#{652}{}{Well I'm sure glad we have the sheriff's lot here to put things in order. Maybe Nestor could hire you guys to be his new guards.}
{652}{}{好吧，我很高兴我们有警长的位子把事情安排好。也许内斯特可以雇你们做他的新警卫。}
#{653}{}{I can understand that, but was it really necessary to massacre all these miners? You could have just arrested them.}
{653}{}{我能理解，但真的有必要屠杀所有这些矿工吗？你可以逮捕他们。}
#{700}{}{Your approach is too simple. These miners started killing Nestor's mercenaries. They would hardly let themselves be arrested by a few policemen. If we hadn't stopped them, the unrest would have spread and there would have been major bloodshed in the city. And we couldn't allow that, now could we?}
{700}{}{你的方法太简单了。这些矿工开始杀害内斯特的雇佣兵。他们很难让自己被几个警察逮捕。如果我们没有阻止他们，动乱就会蔓延，城市就会发生大的流血事件。我们不能允许这样，是吗？}
#{701}{}{Whatever. Can I go now?}
{701}{}{无论什么。我现在可以走了吗？}
#{702}{}{Find whatever excuses you want, copper. You and your buddies are a band of damn murderers. It's time you got a taste of your own medicine.}
{702}{}{你想找什么借口都行，库珀。你和你的兄弟是一群该死的杀人犯。你该尝尝自己的药了。}
#{750}{}{For now. Our work here is done anyway. But remember the police will watch your every step from now on. Any nonsense and you'll answer to us. [He gives the order to disengage.] I hope we understand each other.}
{750}{}{现在。不管怎样，我们这里的工作已经完成了。但请记住，警察会从现在开始监视你的每一步。任何废话你都会回答我们的。[他下令脱离接触]我希望我们能互相理解。}
#{751}{}{[Nod.] Completely.}
{751}{}{[点头]完全。}
#{800}{}{[He looks at you with disgust.] Damn you. [He gestures to the other policemen to stand down.] It's just some stupid asshole. Let's go.}
{800}{}{[他厌恶地看着你]该死。[他示意其他警察站下来]只是个蠢货。走吧。}
#{801}{}{Thankee. [Wave them goodbye.]}
{801}{}{谢谢。[向他们挥手告别。]}
