### {200}{}{Climbing right under a bullet and not afraid? You're either brave or just a fool. Who are you?}
{200}{}{在子弹下爬而不害怕？你要么勇敢，要么就是个傻瓜。你是谁？}
### {1200}{}{The count is so pathetic that he sends a woman to negotiate. Okay. But who are you?}
{1200}{}{伯爵太可怜了，他派了一个女人来谈判。可以但你是谁？}

{201}{}{我是你最后看到的人。}
### {202}{}{It doesn't matter who I am. The mayor sent me to negotiate.}
{202}{}{我是谁并不重要，市长派我来谈判。}

{205}{}{市长不可信任。他比荒原上的蛇还卑鄙。告诉他，如果他不满足我们的要求，我们就会杀死他的女儿。}

### {214}{}{What does it matter?}
{214}{}{这有什么关系？}

{216}{}{[听]}

### {221}{}{You're lying. And I will kill you so that others will not be offended...}
{221}{}{你在撒谎。我会杀了你，这样别人就不会被冒犯...}

{226}{}{你是说我只是自私吗？市长把我驱逐出我的土地后，你认为我该怎么生活？为了生存，我在高速公路上吃腐肉和抢劫大篷车。这一切都是因为一个贪婪的恶棍。}

{227}{}{所以离开这条路。你可以住在凤凰城或其他城市。}
### {228}{}{I don't think I'm ready to start over. It's too late to change anything. And yet your words have sunk into my soul. The girl can leave. It's not her fault. But if the mayor has any dignity left, then let him come to me. Let's have a duel with him, just like in the good old days.}
{228}{}{我想我还没有准备好重新开始。改变任何事情都为时已晚。然而你的话却深深地印在了我的灵魂里。女孩可以离开了。这不是她的错。但如果市长还有什么尊严，那就让他来找我吧。让我们和他决斗吧，就像过去一样。}
### {229}{}{Glad you listened to reason.}

{238}{}{（其中一名同伙打断了领导的话，把他带到角落里，开始积极地和他讨论一些事情）然后...对你是对的，伙计，冷静点...（回复您）我们接受您的条件。把瓶盖给我，你就可以带走那个女孩。}
