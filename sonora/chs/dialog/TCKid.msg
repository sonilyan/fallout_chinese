#The first dialog
### {200}{}{(in front of you is a teenage tinker with wide-open eyes; he is studying your person with interest) A man from the wasteland, you should know that in Two-Sun they do not like outsiders. Better not test our patience.}
{200}{}{（你面前是一个睁着大眼睛的十几岁修修补补的人；他饶有兴趣地研究着你的人）一个来自荒原的人，你应该知道，在《两个太阳》中，他们不喜欢外人。最好不要考验我们的耐心。}

{207}{}{这就是团队的想法。你觉得你怎么样？}
### {208}{}{Hey, who are you calling low-level?}
{208}{}{嘿，你叫谁低级？}
### {209}{}{Typical savage reaction. Even if there is a uranium generator in your village, and the authorities use laser weapons, you still remain savages.}
{209}{}{典型的野蛮反应。即使你的村庄里有铀发生器，当局使用激光武器，你仍然是野蛮人。}
### {210}{}{If our communication is "unproductive", then why did you still talk to me? Is there really any doubt?}
{210}{}{如果我们的交流是“无效的”，那么你为什么还和我说话？真的有什么疑问吗？}

### {227}{}{Childhood? So you're not from here?}
{227}{}{童年所以你不是这里人？}

### {228}{}{Previously, Two-Sun was closed to outsiders. But when the population decreased, the Team had to restore the population with children from other settlements. I was accepted and re-educated at the age of five. I haven't seen my family since.}
{228}{}{此前，《两个太阳》对外界关闭。但当人口减少时，小组不得不恢复其他定居点的儿童人口。我五岁时被录取并接受了再教育。从那以后，我再也没有见过我的家人。}

{229}{}{我经常旅行，我可以找到你亲戚的踪迹。}

### {230}{}{Are you really going to do this? Fine... But my file says that relatives died during the war in Casa Grande. Talk to the locals. I just want to know what happened on the day of our separation.}
{230}{}{你真的要这么做吗？好的但我的档案显示，在格兰德之家的战争中，有亲属死亡。与当地人交谈。我只想知道我们分手那天发生了什么。}
### {231}{}{Why not ask other tinkerers directly?}
{231}{}{为什么不直接问其他修补工呢？}

{232}{}{该队对违反命令的人不礼尚往来。拒绝服从多数人的意见将受到严厉惩罚。这样的先例已经发生了。我不想在自己身上考验团队的耐心。}

### {240}{}{Actually, I'm not on my way, so I'm sorry.}
{240}{}{事实上，我不在路上，所以我很抱歉。}
### {241}{}{Sorry... But if you find yourself in Casa Grande, then remember my request. And now we'd better go our separate ways. Consider that this conversation did not happen.}
{241}{}{很抱歉但如果你发现自己在格兰德之家，那就记住我的请求。现在我们最好分道扬镳。想想看，这次谈话没有发生。}

#Dialogue when the quest is open

{300}{}{你有什么消息要告诉我吗？}
### {301}{}{I'll come back when I find out something.}
{301}{}{我发现什么事就回来。}

#Quest - the family died
### {302}{}{I managed to find your family, but she turned out to be dead. Don't ask, the tinsmiths have nothing to do with it.}
{302}{}{我设法找到了你的家人，但她已经死了。别问了，打铁的人与此无关。}
### {303}{}{This was to be expected... Apparently, the team was right - you can't cling to the past. After all, it is not even known if we could find mutual understanding after so many years of separation. Now, thanks to you, I can finally get rid of the old splinter. And from now on I will not let feelings take over my mind.}
{303}{}{这是意料之中的事...显然，球队是对的――你不能执着于过去。毕竟，在分开这么多年后，我们是否能找到相互理解还不得而知。现在，多亏了你，我终于可以摆脱旧碎片了。从现在起，我不会让感情占据我的头脑。}

{312}{}{我想你不会喜欢他们的故事。据他们说，修补工在突袭期间刚刚把你带走了。}
### {313}{}{That is, my metal brothers have been deceiving me all this time?! That's what I've always been afraid of... You know, Master Hard won't like me digging into the past. Especially after what I learned...}
{313}{}{也就是说，我的金属兄弟一直在欺骗我？！这就是我一直害怕的...你知道吗，哈德大师不会喜欢我挖掘过去。尤其是在我学到了...}
### {314}{}{My part of the deal is done, then figure it out for yourself.}
{314}{}{我的部分交易已经完成，然后自己想办法。}
### {315}{}{Well, no. I have to get proof of your words, otherwise the deal will be canceled.}

### {322}{}{You have to run.}
{322}{}{你必须跑。}
### {323}{}{Okay, I'll help you escape. What should I do?}
{323}{}{好的，我帮你逃跑。我该怎么办？}
### {324}{}{I can ask to join the caravan, but first I need to get rid of the chip control. Every tinker has such a chip sewn under the skin on his neck. It transmits data about my location. Help me remove it! I won't do it myself.}
{324}{}{我可以要求加入车队，但首先我需要摆脱芯片控制。每个修补匠的脖子上都缝着这样一块芯片。它传输有关我所在位置的数据。帮我把它取下来！我不会自己做的。}

{329}{}{我从一开始就对这里很陌生...也许，现在我的情绪在说话，但我宁愿牺牲我在《两个太阳》中岌岌可危的地位，回到我的家人身边。}

#Quest - Hard managed to convince
### {330}{}{Hard has agreed to meet with your family in Two-Sun. You don't have to go against the collective anymore.}
{330}{}{Hard已同意在Two Sun与您的家人见面。你不必再反对集体了。}
### {331}{}{How did you manage it?! It's hard to argue with Master Hard, even for his narrow circle of confidants. But you're not even a tinker. Amazingly... I mean, I'm grateful to you. With your help, I will finally be able to sort out the old thorn. This is very important to me.}
{331}{}{你是怎么做到的？！很难与哈德大师争论，即使是他的密友圈子很窄。但你甚至不是一个修补匠。令人惊奇的是...我的意思是，我很感激你。在你的帮助下，我终于能够解决这个老刺了。这对我来说非常重要。}
### {332}{}{Well, I think we have resolved this issue.}
{332}{}{嗯，我认为我们已经解决了这个问题。}

### {335}{}{Your chip is no longer a problem. You can leave Two-Sun.}

### {337}{}{Well, have a good trip.}

### {340}{}{I think you should know that. The tinsmiths didn't take you away, but took me as payment for helping repair the water station.}
{340}{}{我想你应该知道这一点。铁匠们没有把你带走，而是把我当作帮修理供水站的报酬。}
### {341}{}{Me... sold by parents?! It changes a lot... You know, Master Hard won't like it if I keep bringing up the past. Especially after what I found out. Anyway, thanks to you, I can get rid of the old splinter.}
{341}{}{我…被父母出卖了？！它变化很大...你知道吗，如果我继续提起过去，哈德大师不会喜欢的。尤其是在我发现之后。不管怎样，多亏了你，我可以摆脱旧碎片。}
### {342}{}{Exactly. It's time to put an end to this story and move on.}
{342}{}{确切地是时候结束这个故事，继续前进了。}
### {343}{}{It's up to you.}
