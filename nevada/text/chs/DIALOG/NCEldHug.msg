#{100}{}{You see Huey.}
{100}{}{你看到休伊了。}
#{101}{}{You see a young man with messy hair and a scowl on his face.}
{101}{}{你看到一个头发凌乱、满脸愁容的年轻人。}
#{102}{}{Who are you? Take that off so I could see you.}
{102}{}{你是谁？把它脱下来，这样我就能看见你了。}
#{103}{}{I've got nothing to say to you. Leave me.}
{103}{}{我没什么好说的。离开我。}
#{110}{}{Ah, another one of my dad's goons. What do you need?}
{110}{}{啊，又是我爸爸的手下。你需要什么？}
#{111}{}{So you're Ricardo Bertolini's son? Where's your mother, I wonder?}
{111}{}{你是里卡多・贝托里尼的儿子？我想知道你妈妈在哪儿？}
#{112}{}{Nothing.}
{112}{}{没有什么。}
#{113}{}{Do you really care? Died giving birth.}
{113}{}{你真的在乎吗？生孩子的时候死了。}
#{114}{}{Sorry I asked.}
{114}{}{抱歉我问了。}
#{115}{}{I don't give a shit about your apologies. It's God who should apologize, if he exists.}
{115}{}{我才不管你的道歉呢。上帝应该道歉，如果他存在的话。}
#{116}{}{Are you on your period right now, or you are always this pissed off?}
{116}{}{你现在是来月经了，还是你总是这么生气？}
#{117}{}{Listen, I just want to be left alone. Shit, what I *really* want is for Reno to be nice and quiet, like when I was a kid. But it's a fucking hellhole now, and my father's loving it. And he's trying to show me the "right" way to be just like him. It makes me sick. The world doesn't have to be this shit, you know. But no one wants to fix it.}
{117}{}{听着，我只想一个人呆着。妈的，我真正想要的是里诺和善安静，就像我小时候那样。但现在是个地狱，我父亲很喜欢。他想告诉我怎样才能像他一样。它让我恶心。你知道，世界不必是这样的。但没人想修。}
#{118}{}{You don't approve of your father's ways?}
{118}{}{你不赞成你父亲的方式？}
#{119}{}{I don't approve of many things in this world. Now leave me alone before I get worked up enough to hang myself.}
{119}{}{我不赞成这个世界上的很多事情。别烦我，不然我就上吊了。}
#{120}{}{We'll talk later.}
{120}{}{我们稍后再谈。}
#{121}{}{Fine, don't worry.}
{121}{}{好吧，别担心。}
#{130}{}{Your father sent me to sort some things out. Explain.}
{130}{}{你父亲派我来处理一些事情。解释一下。}
#{131}{}{[Sighs theatrically] Stryker's put a mole in our staff. Now father wants me to end him. The mole doesn't know he's been found. And you're here to... Listen, I'm not stupid, I know why you're here.}
{131}{}{史崔克在我们的工作人员里放了个内奸。现在父亲要我结束他。鼹鼠不知道他被找到了。你来这里是为了...听着，我不傻，我知道你为什么在这里。}
#{132}{}{Is that a problem?}
{132}{}{有问题吗？}
#{133}{}{This isn't about whether he deserves to die. The problem is that it meant for me to prove something to someone that way. I don't want that.}
{133}{}{这与他是否该死无关。问题是这意味着我要用这种方式向别人证明一些东西。我不想那样。}
#{134}{}{Oh boo-hoo, we don't always get what we want. Load your gun, wipe the snot off your nose and lead me to the place. Got it?}
{134}{}{哦，呜呜，我们不是总能得到我们想要的。把枪装上，擦去鼻涕，带我到那个地方。知道了？}
#{135}{}{Just trust me, we'll take care of it out when we get there.}
{135}{}{相信我，我们到了那里会处理好的。}
#{136}{}{[He narrows his eyes, thinking] Fine, let's get this over with. We're doing this on the railroad station where no one will see us. I'll let everyone know we're moving out. Wait here...}
{136}{}{[他眯起眼睛，心想]好吧，让我们结束这一切。我们在火车站做这件事，没人会看到我们。我会告诉大家我们要搬走了。在这里等着...}
#{137}{}{[Wait]}
{137}{}{[等等]}
#{140}{}{Thanks for your help. }
{140}{}{谢谢你的帮助。}
#{141}{}{Can you help me out with another job?}
{141}{}{你能帮我换份工作吗？}
#{142}{}{Go ahead.}
{142}{}{前进。}
#{143}{}{Talk.}
{143}{}{说话。}
#{144}{}{Well, I want one of those funny-looking guns the security here uses.}
{144}{}{嗯，我想要一把保安用的看起来很滑稽的枪。}
#{145}{}{They're called Tommy guns. Father raided museums for them as part of the casino's pre-war image. Stupid, if you ask me, but I it doesn't matter. What matters is they're all locked up on the second floor. The only key's on that big guy in the blue suit, and they see you try to crack the lock, they'll cut you down.}
{145}{}{他们叫汤米枪。作为赌场战前形象的一部分，父亲为他们搜查了博物馆。愚蠢，如果你问我，但我不在乎。重要的是他们都锁在二楼。唯一的钥匙在那个穿蓝色西装的大个子身上，他们看到你试图撬锁，就会把你砍下来。}
#{146}{}{Well, I need some cash.}
{146}{}{嗯，我需要一些现金。}
#{147}{}{You're not getting it from me. Father doesn't give me money without a good reason. But he's got 20 grand in his safe! All of it made off the backs of better people. It'd serve him right if someone took it, but you'll never get in there alive.}
{147}{}{你不会从我这里得到的。父亲没有正当理由不给我钱。但他的保险箱里有两万块！所有这些都是从好人的背上赚来的。如果有人拿了它，他会很高兴的，但你永远不会活着进去的。}
#{148}{}{Do you know the safe combination?}
{148}{}{你知道安全密码吗？}
#{149}{}{Sure. 9-7-5-3-1. You still won't get to it without a fight.}
{149}{}{当然。9-7-5-3-1. 不打一架你还是打不到的。}
#{150}{}{I'm sure there's another way.}
{150}{}{我肯定还有别的办法。}
#{151}{}{Well, if you're gonna try it either way, you should do it at night. The guards get careless around then - playing pool, snoozing in the chairs, that kind of thing. I guess you could cut the lights too. That would stir them up.}
{151}{}{好吧，如果你想试试的话，你应该在晚上做。卫兵们到处乱逛――打台球，在椅子上打盹，诸如此类。我想你也可以把灯关了。那会激起他们的兴趣。}
#{1114}{}{Sorry I asked.}
{1114}{}{抱歉我问了。}
