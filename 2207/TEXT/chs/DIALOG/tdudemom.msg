### {1201}{}{Of course you will! You just have to believe it! [mom leans over and whispers in your ear] But you also need to pray to our Gods for it, they will help you. [she smiles and kisses you on the forehead] Well, I need to go. Oh, yeah, Dad got you a tasty candy - but don't eat it right away. Why don't you share it with Catty? [winks] And if you get bored, come to me, I'll find something for you to do!}
{1201}{}{你当然会的！你只需要相信它！[妈妈俯身在你耳边低语]但你也需要为此向我们的上帝祈祷，他们会帮助你的。[她微笑着亲吻你的额头]好吧，我得走了。哦，是的，爸爸给你买了一个美味的糖果，但不要马上吃。你为什么不和凯蒂分享呢？[眨眼]如果你觉得无聊，就来找我，我会给你找点事做的！}

### {164}{}{Nothing, thanks. I... Feel so sleepy... [go to bed]}
{164}{}{没什么，谢谢。我…感觉很困。。。[上床睡觉]}
### {170}{}{Well. You know, people used to live under the sky. But they stopped appreciating it, stopped respecting the Gods. Because of it, the sky and the earth broke open - and in the end, there was nothing left but death and terrible creatures. The Gods then erected the great Mount Olympus, and under this mountain, they sheltered the purest-spirited people.}
{170}{}{好你知道，人们曾经生活在天空之下。但他们不再欣赏它，不再尊重上帝。正因为如此，天空和大地都裂开了――最后，除了死亡和可怕的生物，什么都没有了。众神随后建造了伟大的奥林匹斯山，在这座山下，他们庇护着最纯洁的精神之人。}
### {171}{}{And the purest-spirited means us, right?}
{171}{}{最纯粹的精神意味着我们，对吧？}
### {172}{}{And where do the Gods themselves live?}
{172}{}{上帝自己住在哪里？}
### {1801}{}{Yes, honey, we are their descendants. We take care of food, repair divine machinery, extract and clean water, and in return the Gods protect us from terrible creatures and shelter us from death. The hour will come, when the Gods will mend the sky and the earth, and all people will be able to live again as before!}
{1801}{}{是的，亲爱的，我们是他们的后代。我们照顾食物，修理神圣的机器，提取和清洁水，作为回报，上帝保护我们免受可怕的生物的伤害，庇护我们免于死亡。时间将到来，上帝将修复天空和大地，所有的人都将能够像以前一样生活！}
### {1802}{}{The gods settled on the top of Olympus. From there, they scare away the terrible creatures and keep mending the sky and the earth. I believe that one day everything will be the same as before, and we will live under the warm sun, just like it was written in that book. Remember?}
{1802}{}{众神定居在奥林匹斯山顶。从那里，他们吓跑了可怕的生物，并不断修补天空和大地。我相信有一天一切都会和以前一样，我们会生活在温暖的阳光下，就像那本书中写的那样。回想起}
### {181}{}{Great! Tell me more!}
{181}{}{太棒了告诉我更多！}
### {182}{}{Yeah, that's great. I feel very sleepy now... [go to bed]}
{182}{}{是的，太棒了。我现在觉得很困。。。[上床睡觉]}
### {190}{}{Do you think it would be good for your sleep? To listen to the stories about such things before your bedtime? Oh, well, you're a grown boy now, aren't you... There are two caves on both sides of our home, the Purgatory and the Caves of the Undead. There are rumors that some Servants once escaped to the caves - and scary things happened to them.}
{190}{}{你认为这对你的睡眠有好处吗？睡前听关于这些事情的故事？哦，好吧，你现在已经长大了，不是吗。。。我们家的两侧有两个洞穴，炼狱和亡灵洞穴。有传言说，一些仆人曾经逃到洞穴里，可怕的事情发生在他们身上。}
### {191}{}{What? What happened to them?}
{191}{}{什么他们怎么了？}
### {200}{}{No one knows, but they ended up turning into terrible creatures because even the broken earth would not bear them! It would be better if these lost ones were thrown into the Mouth of Hades, so they would at least be of help to us in some form... Remember - the entrance to their lair is just outside the room. Don't you ever dare to go in there!!!}
{200}{}{没有人知道，但它们最终变成了可怕的生物，因为即使是破碎的地球也无法忍受它们！如果这些丢失的人被扔进冥口会更好，所以他们至少会以某种形式帮助我们…记住，他们巢穴的入口就在房间外面。你从来不敢进去！！！}
### {201}{}{Of course I won't! Tell me more!}
{201}{}{我当然不会！告诉我更多！}
### {202}{}{Of course I won't... Good night, mom... [go to bed]}
{202}{}{我当然不会。。。晚安，妈妈。。。[上床睡觉]}
### {210}{}{I don't know, baby. The Gods must have decided so. Someone has to take care of us, protect us, defend us. Do you think it's easy to be chosen by the Gods and bear such responsibility?}
{210}{}{我不知道，宝贝。上帝一定已经决定了。必须有人照顾我们，保护我们，保卫我们。你认为被上帝选择并承担这样的责任容易吗？}
### {211}{}{I think yes! I want to be one of the children of the Gods!}
{211}{}{我想是的！我想成为上帝的孩子之一！}
### {212}{}{I wouldn't want to be the Son of the Gods...}
{212}{}{我不想成为众神之子。。。}
### {2201}{}{I don't think it's easy to be one of them. You will have to maintain order, battle hideous monsters... I know I couldn't... And you know how brave I am! [smiles]}
{2201}{}{我认为成为他们中的一员并不容易。你必须维持秩序，与丑陋的怪物作战。。。我知道我不能。。。你知道我有多勇敢！[微笑]}
### {2202}{}{You know, I like being an ordinary Life Servant. You do what you're told, and hope for the better. Isn't that great? [smiles]}
{2202}{}{你知道，我喜欢做一个普通的生活仆人。你按照别人告诉你的去做，并希望一切变得更好。这不是很棒吗？[微笑]}
### {221}{}{Yes, I understand... But tell me more!}
{221}{}{是的，我理解。。。但告诉我更多！}
### {222}{}{Well, yes, I guess. And also I'm very tired now... [go to bed]}
{222}{}{嗯，是的，我想。而且我现在很累。。。[上床睡觉]}
### {2301}{}{Go see your dad, seems like he lost something again! [chuckles]}
{2301}{}{去看看你爸爸，他好像又丢了什么东西！[咯咯笑]}
### {2302}{}{Okay, then talk to your brother. He's been kind of upset lately and he doesn't want to tell me anything.}
{2302}{}{好吧，那就和你哥哥谈谈。他最近有点不高兴，什么都不想告诉我。}
### {2303}{}{I dunno... Have you seen your friend Catty lately? I've heard her mom, Stella, has fallen very ill... Run to see them, maybe they need some help with something?}
{2303}{}{我不知道。。。你最近见过你的朋友凯蒂吗？我听说她的妈妈斯特拉病得很重…跑去看他们，也许他们需要一些帮助？}
### {231}{}{Great, I'll see Dad!}
{231}{}{太好了，我要见爸爸！}
### {232}{}{What's up with him? I'll check it out!}
{232}{}{他怎么了？我来看看！}
### {233}{}{Really? I should run over and talk to them.}
{233}{}{真正地我应该跑过去和他们谈谈。}
