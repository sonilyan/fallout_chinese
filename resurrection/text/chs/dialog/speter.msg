#{100}{}{You see a farmer.}

{150}{}{你看到彼得了。}
#{200}{}{You see an elderly farmer. He's not looking exactly friendly.}
{200}{}{你看到一个上了年纪的农民。他看起来不太友好。}
#{250}{}{You see farmer Peter. He looks grumpy as usual.}
{250}{}{你看到农夫彼得了。他像往常一样脾气暴躁。}
#{300}{}{::Sigh:: Another greenhorn?}
{300}{}{又一个新手？}
#{301}{}{Kill those mantises.}
{301}{}{杀死那些螳螂。}
#{450}{}{You'll regret this!}
{450}{}{你会后悔的！}
#{451}{}{Oh no, I'm not gonna die here!}
{451}{}{哦不，我不会死在这里！}
#{500}{}{Let me guess. You just came to Sedit for the first time and now you got a bunch of nosey questions 'cause you want to find out as much as you can about it. And me, farmer Peter, should be givin' you all the answers? Am I right?}
{500}{}{让我猜猜。你只是第一次来Sedit，现在你有一大堆问题要问，因为你想尽可能多地了解它。而我，农夫彼得，应该给你所有的答案？我说得对吗？}
#{501}{}{Let me guess. You just came to Sedit for the first time and now you got a bunch of nosey questions 'cause you want to find out as much as you can about it. And me, farmer Peter, should be givin' you all the answers? Am I right?}

#{502}{}{Spot on. How did you know?}
{502}{}{当场。你怎么知道的？}
#{503}{}{No, you are not. I've already been here.}
{503}{}{不，你不是。我已经来过这里了。}
#{504}{}{Ghee?!}
{504}{}{酥油？！}
#{550}{}{You see, Sedit is quite a big town, big and well-known. You won't find a better place for living far and wide. That's the reason why every now and then someone new shows up with a vision of a better life. Most of these people drop by me first 'cause I'm the first person they bump into and, of course, they start botherin' me with loads of silly questions. I didn't expect you to be any different.}
{550}{}{你看，塞迪特是一个相当大的城市，又大又有名。你再也找不到更好的地方住了。这就是为什么时不时有新的人带着对美好生活的憧憬出现的原因。大多数人都是先来找我的，因为我是他们第一个碰到的人，当然，他们开始用很多愚蠢的问题来烦我。我没想到你会有什么不同。}
#{551}{}{Ah, I get it. So can I start asking?}
{551}{}{啊，我明白了。我可以开始问了吗？}
#{552}{}{I don't like your tone. You'd better watch out for me, you filthy redneck!}
{552}{}{我不喜欢你的语气。你最好小心我，你这个肮脏的乡巴佬！}
#{553}{}{I have to go. Good-bye.}
{553}{}{我得走了。再见。}
#{600}{}{You have? Well in that case you could explain to me why you're botherin' me. Don't you see I have work to do?}
{600}{}{你有吗？既然这样，你可以向我解释你为什么来烦我。你没看到我还有工作要做吗？}
#{601}{}{Can I ask you a few questions?}
{601}{}{我能问你几个问题吗？}
#{602}{}{Are you trying to get rid of me? How dare you, you filthy pile of brahmin dung?!}
{602}{}{你想摆脱我吗？你怎么敢，你这肮脏的双头牛粪？！}
#{603}{}{I'm sorry, I should go. Good-bye.}
{603}{}{对不起，我该走了。再见。}
#{650}{}{What? Are you high or somethin'? Get back to Lost Town, you filthy junkie! That's where your kind belongs. Here's only for decent folk.}
{650}{}{什么？你是吸毒还是什么？回到迷路的小镇，你这个肮脏的瘾君子！那才是你们的归属。这里只给正派的人。}

{652}{}{恩，你这个坏蛋！糟糕！}
#{653}{}{Me better go, frr! Bye-bye.}

#{705}{}{[Show him your talisman.] Have you seen this sign before?}
{705}{}{[给他看你的护身符]你以前见过这个标志吗？}
#{706}{}{Actually I have to go. Good-bye.}
{706}{}{实际上我得走了。再见。}
#{750}{}{I don't know which dump you came here from but we don't tolerate this kind of behavior in this town. The police like it peaceful here which can mean only two things for troublemakers like you - jail or kicking the bucket. You better behave if you want to avoid both. For your own good.}
{750}{}{我不知道你是从哪个垃圾场来的，但我们不能容忍这种行为。警察喜欢这里的宁静，这对像你这样的捣乱者来说只意味着两件事――坐牢或踢桶。如果你想避免两者，你最好表现得好一点。为了你自己的利益。}

{752}{}{谢谢你的建议。现在我要问你一件事。}
#{753}{}{Enough of this bullshit. Time to die, redneck!}
{753}{}{别说这些废话了。该死了，乡巴佬！}
#{754}{}{Yeah, right. I'd better go.}
{754}{}{是的，没错。我最好走了。}
#{800}{}{Okay then, ask, but be quick about it. My work won't wait...}
{800}{}{好吧，那就问吧，但要快一点。我的工作等不及了。。。}
#{801}{}{Tell me about Sedit.}

{806}{}{实际上我得走了。再见。}
#{850}{}{Sedit is a caravan town. Everyone here's living off of it. Whether you work directly for one of the three caravan companies or just sell them your merchandise, you're always somehow connected. Everybody is. Caravan trade is the reason why the town's so big and prosperous.}
{850}{}{塞迪特是一个大篷车镇。这里的每个人都以此为生。无论你是直接为三家商队公司之一工作，还是仅仅向他们推销你的商品，你总是有某种联系。每个人都是。商队贸易是这个城镇如此大而繁荣的原因。}

{851}{}{我明白了，我还有一个问题。}
#{852}{}{I have to go now. See you later, Peter.}
{852}{}{我得走了。再见，彼得。}
#{900}{}{Try one of the caravan companies. They are always hirin'. Otherwise I'd say you read the bulletin board just a few steps from here in Downtown. You could definitely find something interesting there.}
{900}{}{试试大篷车公司。他们总是雇佣人。否则我会说你在离市区几步远的地方看了公告牌。你肯定能在那里找到一些有趣的东西。}
#{901}{}{Thank you, I have another question.}
{901}{}{谢谢，我还有一个问题。}
#{902}{}{I have to go now. Good-bye.}
{902}{}{我得走了。再见。}
#{950}{}{Sedit should be governed by the town council, but those big-heads are hardly capable of settin' up a meetin'. That's the reason why almost all of the governin' is in the hands of the cops. I'm sure you'll soon find out for yourself.}

{1000}{}{什么流言蜚语，该死？！我是个诚实的农民。我对别人说什么不感兴趣。}
#{1001}{}{But maybe you at least know someone who knows any?}
{1001}{}{但也许你至少认识一个熟人？}
#{1002}{}{In that case I have another question.}
{1002}{}{既然如此，我还有一个问题。}
#{1003}{}{I should go. So long, Peter.}
{1003}{}{我该走了。再见，彼得。}
#{1050}{}{I'm afraid I haven't. But you can try askin' one of the local merchants. They practically deal with everythin' so one of 'em might've come across that trinket of yours.}
{1050}{}{恐怕没有。不过你可以问问当地的一个商人。他们几乎处理所有的事情，所以其中一个可能会碰到你的小饰物。}
#{1051}{}{Thank you, I have another question.}

#{1052}{}{I have to go now. Good-bye.}

#{1103}{}{I have to go now. Good-bye.}
{1103}{}{我得走了。再见。}
#{1150}{}{They are a disgrace to this town. That place of theirs is nothin' else but one big, ugly mess of trouble. Somebody shoud finally kick them outta there. I don't understand what the sheriff's still waitin' for. And... well, forget it! I don't want to talk about them anymore.}
{1150}{}{他们是这个城市的耻辱。他们的那个地方除了一个又大又难看的麻烦，别无他物。总得有人把他们踢出去。我不明白警长还在等什么。还有。。。算了吧！我不想再谈论他们了。}

#{1205}{}{Huh?!}
{1205}{}{呵呵？！}
#{1250}{}{[He makes a grimace.] Took 'em long enough. Sedit Caravan and Frederyk's Dream made a deal with me a long time ago.

{1250}{}{[他做了个鬼脸]花了他们很长时间。塞迪特商队和弗雷德里克的梦想很久以前就和我达成了协议。我想他们不太关心他们的双头牛在深红色大篷车里的幸福。好吧，我的调料的价格和其他调料一样，每月供应500个瓶盖。}
#{1251}{}{OK, we have a deal. I'll let the people at the Crimson Caravan know.}
{1251}{}{好吧，我们说好了。我会让深红色车队的人知道的。}
