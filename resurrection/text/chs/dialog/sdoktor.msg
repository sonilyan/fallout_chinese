{1300}{}{什么？嗯，她可能是指艾滋病。愚蠢的妓女。有个顾客在她脑袋里塞满了这样的垃圾，她只是相信。她肯定没听我说。我甚至不能诊断出这种病。}
#{1301}{}{So what do you know about AIDS?}
{1301}{}{你对艾滋病了解多少？}
#{1350}{}{Not much. Only what I've read in pre-war medical manuals. The disease is transmitted by a virus which can begin to manifest at any time, or not at all. If this occurs, it causes reduced immunity... At least, I think so. That's all I remember.}
{1350}{}{不多。只有我在战前的医疗手册上读到的。这种疾病是由病毒传播的，这种病毒可以在任何时候开始出现，也可以根本不出现。如果发生这种情况，会导致免疫力降低。。。至少，我想是这样。我只记得这些。}
#{1351}{}{Thank you.}
{1351}{}{非常感谢。}
