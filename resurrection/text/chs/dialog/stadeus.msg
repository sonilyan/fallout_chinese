#{100}{}{You see an old man.}
{100}{}{你看到一个老人。}
#{150}{}{You see Tadeus.}
{150}{}{你看到塔德斯了。}
#{200}{}{You see an old bent man in a faded purple robe.}
{200}{}{你看到一个穿着褪了色的紫色长袍的弯腰老人。}
#{250}{}{You see Tadeus, a former member of the Children of the Cathedral.}
{250}{}{你看塔德乌斯，一位前主教大教堂成员。}
#{301}{}{Go ahead, do it! You can take my stuff after that if you want.}
{301}{}{去吧，去做！如果你愿意的话，你可以拿走我的东西。}
#{302}{}{I follow Unity!}
{302}{}{我追随团结！}
#{303}{}{Master! I'm joining you!}
{303}{}{主人！我要加入你们！}
#{304}{}{Hey! Right here! Wants to kill me!}
{304}{}{嘿！就在这里！想杀了我！}
#{305}{}{Heeelp! Over here!}
{305}{}{嘿，帮帮我！在这里！}
#{306}{}{They're after me!}
{306}{}{他们在追我！}
#{307}{}{They're trying to kill me!}
{307}{}{他们想杀了我！}
#{500}{}{Leave me alone.}
{500}{}{别管我。}
#{501}{}{Are you Tadeus, former member of the Children of the Cathedral?}
{501}{}{你是塔德乌斯，主教大教堂，前成员吗？}
#{502}{}{Why? Something happened? Do you want to talk about it?}
{502}{}{为什么？出什么事了？你想谈谈吗？}
#{503}{}{Ugh.}
{503}{}{啊。}
#{504}{}{Fine.}
{504}{}{好的。}
#{550}{}{Leave me alone, I think I made myself very clear.}
{550}{}{别管我，我想我说得很清楚。}
#{551}{}{OK, I'm going.}
{551}{}{好的，我要走了。}
#{600}{}{That's me. It seems you came to me with something specific in your mind.}
{600}{}{那是我。看来你来找我的时候脑子里有什么特别的想法。}
#{601}{}{I came here to kill you because Demetre from the Crimson Caravan wants you dead. It's a revenge for supermutants destroying the Hub.}
{601}{}{我来这里杀你是因为深红色车队的德米特里想杀了你。这是对摧毁中心的超级变种人的报复。}
#{602}{}{Demetre from the Crimson Caravan wants me to kill you as revenge for supermutants destroying the Hub. I want to make sure you really deserve to die.}
{602}{}{深红色商队的德米特里想让我杀了你，作为超级变种人摧毁中心的报复。我想确定你真的活该死。}
#{603}{}{I've come to warn you Demetre from the Crimson Caravan wants to kill you. He hired me to do it.}
{603}{}{我来警告你，深红色车队的德米特里想杀了你。他雇我来做的。}
#{650}{}{Demetre? Yes, I've heard about him. I hear he didn't speak kindly about me. Even if you try avoiding people, there are things you'll end up knowing, anyway. I'm supposed to die because I wanted to stop with the killing and that fool won't even face me on his own!}
{650}{}{德米特里？是的，我听说过他。我听说他对我不友好。即使你试着避开别人，无论如何，有些事情你最终还是会知道的。我应该死，因为我想停止杀戮，而那个傻瓜甚至连自己都不会面对我！}
#{651}{}{What are you talking about?}
{651}{}{你在说什么？}
#{700}{}{Strange question. We're already dead, all of us! Humankind should have died out when we destroyed ourselves. What's happening now, that ain't living, that's dying. Nobody cares, me the least of all. Go ahead and kill me, but I'd appreciate if you fulfilled my last wish.}
{700}{}{奇怪的问题。我们都已经死了！当我们毁灭自己的时候，人类应该灭绝。现在发生的事，不是活着，而是死。没人在乎，尤其是我。去杀了我吧，如果你能实现我的遗愿我会很感激的。}
#{701}{}{What do you want?}
{701}{}{你想要什么？}
#{750}{}{I'm talking about the Master being our one and only salvation! He was the one true hope! We could have become better. By ceasing to be human! Humans never managed anything apart from killing one another. And one human doomed the Master, doomed our hope.}
{750}{}{我说的是主教是我们唯一的救世主！他是唯一真正的希望！我们本可以变得更好的。不再是人类！人类除了互相残杀之外，什么也没做过。一个人注定了主教，注定了我们的希望。}
#{751}{}{But...}
{751}{}{但是……}
#{800}{}{Mutants! I know what you're about to say. But the mutants and the Master were one! Unity! With him gone, they turned to dreadful, mindless murdering to avenge their Master. That's why they destroyed the Hub and other places! Supermutants are only a sad memory now. Too much radiation meant their transformation went wrong, they are so stupid they now listen to anyone wearing the robe of the Children. That's not how it was supposed to be.}
{800}{}{变种人！我知道你要说什么。但是变种人和主教是一体的！团结！他走后，他们转向可怕的，无意识的谋杀，以报复他们的主教。这就是为什么他们摧毁了中心和其他地方！超级变种人现在只是一个悲伤的记忆。太多的辐射意味着他们的转变出了问题，他们是如此愚蠢，他们现在听任何人穿长袍的孩子。事情本来不是这样的。}
#{801}{}{OK, you bled your heart out with your tongue, it's time you bled for real.}
{801}{}{好吧，你的舌头把你的心都流出来了，是时候你真的流出来了。}
#{802}{}{Maybe you're right. But what should I do?}
{802}{}{也许你是对的。但我该怎么办呢？}
#{803}{}{Maybe you're right. But what should I do?}
{803}{}{也许你是对的。但我该怎么办呢？}
#{850}{}{I want you to carry out my revenge on Demetre, because it's obvious I'll never be able to do it on my own. I want you to inject him with this. [He pulls out a syringe filled with green liquid.] I've been saving it for myself but it doesn't matter now. Once, it could have been my salvation, now it's going to be his punishment.}
{850}{}{我要你替我报复德米特里，因为很明显我一个人永远做不到。我要你给他注射这个。[他拿出一个装满绿色液体的注射器]我一直在为自己留着，但现在没关系了。曾经，这可能是我的救赎，现在，这将是他的惩罚。}
#{851}{}{What is it?}
{851}{}{这是怎么一回事？}
#{900}{}{FEV! Don't be afraid, it's just a small, diluted amount, he won't feel anything. But the virus will start working, slowly, and he'll feel the change in a several weeks or months. At first, it will be fine, he will be stronger, he'll feel better. Later, the slow change will become painful, visible, and he will become aggressive. In the end, he'll become that which he hates most - a supermutant.}
{900}{}{费夫！别害怕，这只是一个小的，稀释的量，他不会感觉到什么。但是病毒会慢慢地开始工作，他会在几周或几个月内感受到这种变化。一开始，一切都会好起来的，他会更强壮，他会感觉更好。后来，缓慢的变化会变得痛苦、明显，他会变得咄咄逼人。最后，他会变成他最讨厌的人――一个超级变种人。}
#{901}{}{So you want me to inject him this stuff?}
{901}{}{所以你想让我给他注射这种东西？}
#{902}{}{So you want me to inject him this stuff?}
{902}{}{所以你想让我给他注射这种东西？}
#{950}{}{Yes! You have to promise me. There's nothing left for me but to believe you and hope you'll really do it. If you can promise this, you can kill me, I won't be any trouble. It'll be a sweet release for me.}
{950}{}{对！你得答应我。除了相信你并希望你真的做到，我什么都没有了。如果你能答应，你可以杀了我，我不会有任何麻烦。对我来说这将是一个甜蜜的释放。}
#{951}{}{Fine, I promise. [Take the injection from him.]}
{951}{}{好吧，我保证。[从他那里打针。]}
#{952}{}{I like trouble.}
{952}{}{我喜欢麻烦。}
#{953}{}{I like trouble.}
{953}{}{我喜欢麻烦。}
#{954}{}{I'm not planning to kill you, so just hold on to that syringe.}
{954}{}{我不打算杀你，所以拿着注射器。}
#{1000}{}{Yes? And how fast can you be? You think you can take me down before some cop hears me? How many cops can you kill at one time? Think about it! The police don't like it when someone who doesn't give them something extra is shooting in the streets. You're gonna shoot the whole town because of me?}
{1000}{}{对？你能跑多快？你觉得你能在警察听到我之前把我干掉吗？你一次能杀多少警察？好好想想！警察不喜欢有人不给他们额外的东西在街上开枪。因为我你要开枪打整个镇子？}
#{1001}{}{Fine, I'll fulfil your wish. [Take the injection from him.]}
{1001}{}{好吧，我会实现你的愿望。[从他那里打针。]}
#{1002}{}{I'll risk it!}
{1002}{}{我要冒这个险！}
#{1050}{}{Remember, nothing's what it seems to be at first glance. Now I am ready to walk through the Holy Flame! I follow Unity, we will soon meet, Master!}
{1050}{}{记住，乍一看什么都不像。现在我准备好穿过圣火了！我跟随团结，我们很快就会相遇，主教！}
#{1051}{}{Bye.}
{1051}{}{再见。}
#{1100}{}{And why haven't you done it yet? Why haven't you killed another stranger for a handful of cursed caps like I'm sure you've done so many times before?}
{1100}{}{你为什么还没做呢？你为什么不为一把该死的瓶盖杀了另一个陌生人呢？我相信你以前做过很多次了？}
#{1101}{}{If that's how you see it, I'm going to kill you. No sweat.}
{1101}{}{如果你这么看，我就杀了你。没有汗水。}
#{1102}{}{You really wish to die?}
{1102}{}{你真的想死吗？}
#{1103}{}{That's not how I am, I came here to warn you. I'm leaving now.}
{1103}{}{我不是这样的，我是来警告你的。我要走了。}
#{1150}{}{Wait! Hear me out! I deserve the right of revenge, just like Demetre! It's a natural way of humans, just like all our vices.}
{1150}{}{等待！听我说完！我应该得到复仇的权利，就像德米特里一样！这是人类的天性，就像我们所有的恶习一样。}
#{1151}{}{What are you talking about?}
{1151}{}{你在说什么？}
#{1152}{}{What are you talking about?}
