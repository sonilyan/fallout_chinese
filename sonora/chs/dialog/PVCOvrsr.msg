#The first dialog
### {200}{}{Impressive. You managed to get into the Vault without raising an alarm, get past the guards and get to the command center itself. Such a level of espionage is extremely rare. So why are you here?}
{200}{}{给人印象深刻的你设法在没有发出警报的情况下进入了保险库，越过了警卫，到达了指挥中心。这种程度的间谍活动极为罕见。那你为什么在这里？}
### {201}{}{Impressive. Even after raising the alarm throughout the Vault, you managed to get to the command center itself. Few people are capable of this. What do you want?}
{201}{}{给人印象深刻的即使在整个Vault中发出警报后，您还是设法到达了命令中心本身。很少有人能做到这一点。你想要什么？}
### {202}{}{Hmm. A stranger in a Vault is always suspicious. Why are you here?}
{202}{}{嗯。避难所里的陌生人总是很可疑。你为什么在这里？}
### {203}{}{Aaron sent me. I want to serve the Sacred Fire.}
{203}{}{亚伦派我来的。我想为圣火服务。}
### {204}{}{I'm here for one purpose - to kill you.}
{204}{}{我来这里的目的只有一个――杀了你。}
### {205}{}{Then let's not waste time...}
{205}{}{那我们就不要浪费时间了...}
### {206}{}{Die for the freedom of the Villa!}
{206}{}{为别墅的自由而死！}
### {207}{}{I won't answer until I know who I'm talking to.}
{207}{}{我不会回答，直到我知道我在和谁说话。}
### {208}{}{Apparently, you don't understand your situation well. Well, my name is Ulysses Grant, I am the first advisor to the Phoenix Lord Aaron. That should be enough for you.}
{208}{}{显然，你不太了解自己的处境。我的名字叫尤利西斯・格兰特，我是凤凰领主亚伦的第一位顾问。这对你来说应该足够了。}
### {209}{}{You're exactly who I'm looking for. Looking to finish it off.}
{209}{}{你正是我要找的人。希望完成它。}

#The first dialogue if GG is a peasant
### {210}{}{I'm looking for my tribesmen from the Villa. They say the Followers of Fire enslaved them.}
{210}{}{我在别墅里找我的部落成员。他们说火的追随者奴役了他们。}
### {211}{}{Villa... I remember. One of the primitive villages in the northwest. The slaves were transported from there to Two-Sun and now they will become fuel in the progress machine. It's a great honor, even if you don't like it.}
{211}{}{别墅...我记得。西北部的一个原始村庄。奴隶们从那里被运送到两个太阳，现在他们将成为进步机器的燃料。这是一种莫大的荣誉，即使你不喜欢。}
### {212}{}{Why do you need slaves?}
{212}{}{你为什么需要奴隶？}
### {213}{}{Oh, there are many reasons - infrastructure restoration, work in mines, transportation between cities and much of what will be much more difficult to do by the forces of free mercenaries. The development of civilization requires large labor resources. And slavery is the most appropriate way to get them.}
{213}{}{哦，原因有很多――基础设施的恢复、矿山的工作、城市之间的运输，以及自由雇佣军部队更难做到的许多事情。文明的发展需要大量的劳动力资源。奴役是获得它们的最合适的方式。}
### {214}{}{Is it possible to enslave innocent people?}
{214}{}{奴役无辜的人有可能吗？}
### {215}{}{Most of the locals are busy surviving and do not contribute to the development of the region at all. On the contrary, they are ready to fight and are not ready to cooperate. Narrow-minded egoism is what tribes like your Villa live by. To turn the power of these savages to the benefit of the whole region is a worthy goal to sacrifice the ethical side of the issue.}
{215}{}{大多数当地人忙于生存，根本没有为该地区的发展做出贡献。相反，他们准备战斗，却不准备合作。狭隘的利己主义是像你的别墅这样的部落赖以生存的。将这些野蛮人的力量转化为整个地区的利益是一个值得牺牲道德方面的目标。}
### {216}{}{What kind of progress are you talking about?}
{216}{}{你在说什么样的进步？}
### {217}{}{You've come a long way, haven't you? The usual landscape now is a barren wasteland or the ruins of ancient cities. Life in such conditions is difficult and dangerous. But there are places where civilization returns. Electricity, medicine, education - all this has returned to the lands of Sonora thanks to us. And compared to this, the small household concerns of the Villa are nothing more than a mouse fuss.}
{217}{}{你已经走过了很长的路，不是吗？现在通常的景观是贫瘠的荒地或古城废墟。在这样的条件下生活是困难和危险的。但也有文明回归的地方。电力、医疗、教育――多亏了我们，所有这些都回到了索诺拉的土地上。与此相比，别墅的小家庭问题只不过是小题大做。}
### {218}{}{And what's next - are you going to enslave the whole of Sonora?}
{218}{}{接下来你会奴役整个索诺拉吗？}
### {219}{}{That would be too wasteful. It is much easier to create habitable centers of civilization. By themselves, these colonies will be an example - a model to which the rest of the savages will catch up.}
{219}{}{那太浪费了。创造宜居的文明中心要容易得多。就其本身而言，这些殖民地将是一个榜样――其他野蛮人将效仿的榜样。}
### {220}{}{The villa didn't need your "civilization". We had a lot of food and a complete order in the community.}
{220}{}{别墅不需要你的“文明”。我们在社区里有很多食物和完整的订单。}
### {221}{}{You're wrong. Your community is living out the last generations. Exhaustion of fertility, accumulation of mutations, high mortality rate, insecurity from external enemies and ordinary narrow-mindedness - all this limits your community and leads to imminent death. Don't you believe it? In vain. We have seen entire settlements go crazy just because the only water pump there broke down.}
{221}{}{你错了。你们的社区正在延续上一代人的生活。生育能力的耗尽、突变的积累、高死亡率、来自外部敌人的不安全感和普通的狭隘思想――所有这些都限制了你的社区，并导致迫在眉睫的死亡。你不相信吗？徒劳。我们看到整个定居点因为那里唯一的水泵坏了而变得疯狂。}
### {222}{}{And what does your cult offer?}
{222}{}{你的邪教提供了什么？}
### {223}{}{A return to civilization, of course. And we have already achieved a lot.}
{223}{}{当然是文明的回归。我们已经取得了很多成就。}
### {224}{}{Nonsense. You are simply parasitizing other people.}
{224}{}{胡说你只是寄生在别人身上。}
### {225}{}{That's reasonable. Sonora clearly lacks a strong hand to unite the fallen population.}
{225}{}{这是合理的。索诺拉显然缺乏团结衰落人口的有力力量。}
### {226}{}{It's a pity that you didn't manage to get into our ideas. However, nothing new. You're just an ordinary hindrance to our plans. I'll have to eliminate you...}
{226}{}{很遗憾你没能理解我们的想法。然而，没有什么新鲜事。你只是我们计划的一个普通障碍。我必须淘汰你...}
### {227}{}{Wait, we haven't...}
{227}{}{等等，我们还没有...}
### {228}{}{To do this, it is necessary to abandon the past - from superstitions, traditions and even family ties. Are you ready for such hardships?}
{228}{}{要做到这一点，就必须抛弃过去――抛弃迷信、传统甚至家庭关系。你准备好面对这样的困难了吗？}
### {1228}{}{To do this, it is necessary to abandon the past - from superstitions, traditions and even family ties. Are you ready for such hardships?}
{1228}{}{要做到这一点，就必须抛弃过去――抛弃迷信、传统甚至家庭关系。你准备好面对这样的困难了吗？}
### {229}{}{Quite. I wish the Villa to join the path of progress and civilization.}
{229}{}{相当地我希望别墅能加入进步和文明的道路。}
### {230}{}{You're offering the impossible. Go to hell!}
{230}{}{你在提供不可能的东西。见鬼去吧！}
### {231}{}{In this case, prove your intentions - become a part of the cult of the Sacred Fire. By this you will give an example to your fellow tribesmen.}
{231}{}{在这种情况下，证明你的意图――成为圣火崇拜的一部分。这样，你将给你的部落同胞们树立一个榜样。}
### {232}{}{Become a Follower? I'll have to talk to Aaron first. And what's next?}
{232}{}{成为追随者？我得先和亚伦谈谈。接下来是什么？}
### {233}{}{The villa must become our new colony, otherwise time will wipe it off the face of the earth. Try to explain this to the rest of the peasants. And if you succeed, I will free all the slaves from the Villa.}
{233}{}{别墅必须成为我们的新殖民地，否则时间会把它从地球上抹去。试着向其他农民解释一下。如果你成功了，我会把所有的奴隶从别墅里解放出来。}
### {234}{}{Agreed.}
{234}{}{同意。}
### {235}{}{You're offering the impossible. Go to hell!}
{235}{}{你在提供不可能的东西。见鬼去吧！}
### {236}{}{Talk to Aaron. He will give further instructions.}
{236}{}{和亚伦谈谈。他将作出进一步指示。}
### {237}{}{OK.}
{237}{}{好啊}
### {238}{}{It's unthinkable. People like you need to be destroyed urgently!}
{238}{}{这是不可想象的。像你这样的人急需被摧毁！}
### {239}{}{Yes, you're just covering up ordinary evil with beautiful words. You can't confuse me.}
{239}{}{是的，你只是在用美丽的文字掩盖普通的邪恶。你不能把我弄糊涂。}

#The first dialogue if GG became a member of BS
### {240}{}{Glad to meet you, brother. The Brotherhood's agents have already passed on information about you and your service. The General Staff considers you promising, but my agents have a slightly different opinion.}
{240}{}{很高兴见到你，兄弟。兄弟会的特工已经传递了关于你和你的服务的信息。总参谋部认为你很有前途，但我的特工们的意见略有不同。}
### {1240}{}{Glad to meet you, Sister. The Brotherhood's agents have already passed on information about you and your service. The General Staff considers you promising, but my agents have a slightly different opinion.}
{1240}{}{很高兴认识你，姐姐。兄弟会的特工已经传递了关于你和你的服务的信息。总参谋部认为你很有前途，但我的特工们的意见略有不同。}
### {241}{}{Glad to meet you, brother. The Brotherhood's agents have already passed on information about you and your service. I must say, you're showing great promise.}
{241}{}{很高兴见到你，兄弟。兄弟会的特工已经传递了关于你和你的服务的信息。我必须说，你表现出了巨大的希望。}
### {1241}{}{Glad to meet you, Sister. The Brotherhood's agents have already passed on information about you and your service. I must say, you're showing great promise.}
{1241}{}{很高兴认识你，姐姐。兄弟会的特工已经传递了关于你和你的服务的信息。我必须说，你表现出了巨大的希望。}
### {242}{}{Aren't you also a member of the Brotherhood of Steel?}
{242}{}{你不是也是钢铁兄弟会的成员吗？}
### {243}{}{Paladin Ulysses Grant. But in the Cathedral they call me a Counselor. I try to stay incognito in this city.}
{243}{}{圣骑士尤利西斯・格兰特。但在大教堂里，他们叫我辅导员。我尽量在这个城市隐姓埋名。}
### {244}{}{What is the Brotherhood paladin doing in the heart of a strange cult?}
{244}{}{兄弟会圣骑士在一个奇怪的邪教中心做什么？}
### {245}{}{In fact, I run this cult, although few people know about it. The fact is that the Church of the Sacred Fire was organized by the Brotherhood of Steel a few years ago. Back then there was a time of troubles in Phoenix, we helped one of the clans seize power over the city and then put the people we needed at the helm. I still lead this elite for the sake of the Brotherhood.}
{245}{}{事实上，我管理着这个邪教，尽管很少有人知道它。事实上，圣火教堂是几年前由钢铁兄弟会组织的。当时凤凰城有一段麻烦时期，我们帮助其中一个部族夺取了城市的权力，然后让我们需要的人掌舵。为了兄弟会，我仍然领导着这个精英。}
### {246}{}{In other words, are Aaron and the other sectarians just a puppet in the hands of the Brotherhood?}
{246}{}{换句话说，亚伦和其他宗派主义者只是兄弟会手中的傀儡吗？}
### {247}{}{All right. The Brotherhood needs various resources and power over the region. But there are too few of us to keep the situation under control on our own. The idea of a revolution and the creation of a subsidiary cult turned out to be an ideal solution. Now we can only give commands, the real work is done by people accountable to us.}
{247}{}{好吧兄弟会需要在该地区拥有各种资源和权力。但我们中的人太少，无法独自控制局势。革命和建立附属邪教的想法被证明是一个理想的解决方案。现在我们只能下达命令，真正的工作是由对我们负责的人完成的。}
### {248}{}{It should be convenient. And what about the slavery in which the cult is seen?}
{248}{}{应该很方便。邪教所处的奴隶制又如何呢？}
### {249}{}{The elders of the order dislike slavery. But at the moment it is an inevitable sacrifice for the benefit of the development of the region. It will take a couple of generations until we can give up forced labor. Unfortunately, the local savages are not yet ready to take an independent step towards progress.}
{249}{}{骑士团的元老们不喜欢奴隶制。但目前，为了该地区的发展，这是一种不可避免的牺牲。我们需要几代人才能放弃强迫劳动。不幸的是，当地的野蛮人还没有准备好向进步迈出独立的一步。}
### {250}{}{What about the Villa?}
{250}{}{别墅怎么样？}
### {251}{}{Oh, yes, the Villa... One of the primitive villages in the northwest. The report says you're from there. I'm sorry about what happened. In any case, your tribesmen have become fuel in the progress machine, and this is a great honor. And as a member of the Brotherhood of Steel, you should understand and accept this.}
{251}{}{哦，是的，别墅...西北部的一个原始村庄。报告说你来自那里。我对发生的事情感到抱歉。无论如何，你的部落成员已经成为进步机器的燃料，这是一种莫大的荣誉。作为钢铁兄弟会的一员，你应该理解并接受这一点。}
### {252}{}{Is it possible to free the Villa from bondage?}
{252}{}{有可能把别墅从束缚中解放出来吗？}
### {253}{}{Of course. But the Villa should become one of our colonies. Unfortunately, right now I have too much work to deal with this issue. You're going to have to help me. Talk to Aaron, he will give further instructions.}
{253}{}{当然但别墅应该成为我们的殖民地之一。不幸的是，现在我有太多的工作要处理这个问题。你必须帮助我。和亚伦谈谈，他会给出进一步的指示。}
### {254}{}{Okay, I'll talk to him.}
{254}{}{好吧，我和他谈谈。}
### {255}{}{Of course. But the Villa should become one of our colonies. This question will take some time.}
{255}{}{当然但别墅应该成为我们的殖民地之一。这个问题需要一些时间。}
### {256}{}{Then we'll talk about it a little later.}
{256}{}{那我们稍后再谈。}
### {257}{}{Glad to meet you, brother. The Brotherhood's agents have already passed on information about you and your service. I must say, you're showing great promise. However, it was very rash of you to raise the alarm on the way here.}
{257}{}{很高兴见到你，兄弟。兄弟会的特工已经传递了关于你和你的服务的信息。我必须说，你表现出了巨大的希望。然而，你在来这里的路上拉响警报真是太鲁莽了。}

#After the destruction of Puerto
### {260}{}{I knew you'd show up... Savage! Even after destroying our base in Puerto, you can't stop in your thirst for revenge? This is the problem of all local tribes - you cling to the past, although a bright future is revealed to you. We just need to accept progress and abandon old prejudices. But no, it's too difficult for you!}
{260}{}{我就知道你会出现...凶恶的即使在摧毁了我们在波多黎各的基地后，你也不能停止复仇的渴望？这是所有当地部落的问题――你执着于过去，尽管光明的未来展现在你面前。我们只需要接受进步，摒弃旧的偏见。但不，这对你来说太难了！}
### {261}{}{In other words, the Brotherhood has failed in the lands of Sonora. Get over it, you idiot.}
{261}{}{换句话说，兄弟会在索诺拉的土地上失败了。忘掉它，你这个白痴。}
### {262}{}{It's just a postponement of the inevitable. The elders in California will open a new fort in Sonora sooner or later. By this time I will have time to prepare the Phoenix. Everything is just beginning.}
{262}{}{这只是不可避免的事情的延期。加利福尼亚州的长老们迟早会在索诺拉开设一座新堡垒。到这个时候，我将有时间准备凤凰号。一切才刚刚开始。}
### {263}{}{Hey, why do you need these machine guns... wait, you're not going to...}
{263}{}{嘿，你为什么需要这些机关枪...等等，你不会...}
### {264}{}{You're wrong. The Brotherhood failed because of mistakes in its ideology, not because of the backwardness of the region.}
{264}{}{你错了。兄弟会的失败是因为其意识形态上的错误，而不是因为该地区的落后。}
### {265}{}{Nonsense!}
{265}{}{胡说}
### {266}{}{Not at all. You imposed ideas on the population that they were not ready to accept. So they were rebuffed.}
{266}{}{一点也不。你把人们还没有准备好接受的想法强加给他们。所以他们被拒绝了。}
### {267}{}{We tried to change you, to make you better! And instead of gratitude, they got a knife in the back. Look at how much the Brotherhood has done for you-electricity, education, economy. Does all this mean nothing?}
{267}{}{我们试图改变你，让你变得更好！他们非但没有感激，反而在背后捅了一把刀。看看兄弟会为你们在电力、教育和经济方面做了多少。这一切毫无意义吗？}
### {268}{}{No, you weren't trying to make us better. You tried to make us your subjects. We are secondary to you. And we will always be like this.}
{268}{}{不，你不是想让我们变得更好。你试图让我们成为你的主题。我们比你次要。我们永远都是这样。}
### {269}{}{Maybe so. But peaceful means did not work. All we had to do was impose our ideas by force.}
{269}{}{也许是这样。但和平手段没有奏效。我们所要做的就是强行推行我们的想法。}
### {270}{}{But who decided that your ideas about the world are correct? Because they are taken from the pre-war era? But you know how that story ended.}
{270}{}{但是谁认为你对世界的看法是正确的呢？因为它们取自战前时代？但你知道这个故事是怎么结束的。}
### {271}{}{War... war doesn't change. We wanted to restore the former greatness of these lands.}
{271}{}{战争战争不会改变。我们想恢复这些土地昔日的伟大。}
### {272}{}{And as a result, they became ordinary invaders.}
{272}{}{结果，他们变成了普通的入侵者。}
### {273}{}{Enough! Get back to your garden beds, savage. These lands are unworthy of our attention...}
{273}{}{足够地回到你的花园床上，野蛮人。这些土地不值得我们关注...}
### {274}{}{Hmm...}

### {327}{}{In a way. To be honest, we used the experience of another cult that had recently operated in California. It turned out to be a good idea.}
{327}{}{在某种程度上老实说，我们使用了最近在加利福尼亚州运作的另一个邪教的经验。结果证明这是个好主意。}
### {328}{}{What kind of Vault is this?}

### {330}{}{What do you know about the Great War?}

### {335}{}{Someday he will resist his position.}

### {343}{}{How did it turn out that the Brotherhood runs a cult?}
{343}{}{兄弟会是如何运作邪教的？}

{344}{}{兄弟会需要控制周围的土地。我们不能自己提供。因此，我们决定在凤凰城建立一个傀儡政府，并通过它来管理这个地区。我们创建了这个邪教，并在它的旗帜下发动了一场革命。}
### {345}{}{What are the Brotherhood's plans for this region?}
{345}{}{兄弟会对这个地区有什么计划？}
### {346}{}{We collect pre-war technologies and some resources. Mainly the general staff in California needs nuclear fuel. To ensure supplies, we need workers. And for this - the power in all of Arizona. To establish, strengthen and expand this power is our immediate task.}
{346}{}{我们收集战前的技术和一些资源。主要是加州的普通员工需要核燃料。为了确保供应，我们需要工人。为了这个――亚利桑那州的权力。建立、加强和扩大这种力量是我们的当务之急。}

{351}{}{不，去波多黎各吧，现在没有什么比这更重要的了。}
### {352}{}{The task is clear.}
{352}{}{任务很明确。}
### {353}{}{Perhaps, yes. Upon returning to Phoenix, George Crook began to create problems. The old soldier talks too much and demands too much. It is necessary to shut it up.}
{353}{}{也许，是的。回到凤凰城后，乔治・克鲁克开始制造麻烦。老战士说得太多，要求太高。有必要闭嘴。}
### {354}{}{What's the catch?}

{356}{}{那我怎么能被人忽视呢？}
### {357}{}{Think about it. I will pay 500 caps for the elimination of the commander.}

### {363}{}{Here's your fee. Don't you dare tell anyone about our agreement. No one will believe you anyway.}
{363}{}{这是您的费用。你不敢把我们的协议告诉任何人。不管怎样，没有人会相信你。}
### {364}{}{Only one question - why was it necessary to kill Crook? Didn't he serve for the glory of the empire?}
{364}{}{只有一个问题――为什么有必要杀死克鲁克？他不是为帝国的荣耀服务吗？}
### {365}{}{Roger that, sir. Can I go?}
{365}{}{收到，先生。我能去吗？}
### {1365}{}{Copy that, sir. Can I go now?}
{1365}{}{收到，先生。我现在可以走了吗？}
### {366}{}{There are two reasons for this. First of all, Commander Crook has done his job, he will only be a burden. The empire no longer has strong enemies, and the old war wolves don't like to sit around.}
{366}{}{这有两个原因。首先，克鲁克指挥官已经完成了他的工作，他只会成为一个负担。帝国不再有强大的敌人，古老的战狼也不喜欢坐视不管。}
### {367}{}{And the second reason?}
{367}{}{第二个原因是什么？}
### {368}{}{Aaron deserved a little punishment. Thanks to his recent victories, he began to think too much of himself, began to demand a lot. We need to remind him where he started and who is the true master here.}
{368}{}{亚伦应该受到一点惩罚。由于最近的胜利，他开始对自己考虑太多，开始要求很多。我们需要提醒他从哪里开始，谁才是真正的大师。}
### {369}{}{I see.}
{369}{}{我明白了。}
### {370}{}{It doesn't change anything for you, recruit. You know your task - they are waiting for you in Puerto. Go.}
{370}{}{这对你来说没有任何改变，新兵。你知道你的任务――他们在波多黎各等着你。去}
### {371}{}{I have the honor.}
{371}{}{我很荣幸。}

#Your quest
### {400}{}{You managed to outsmart Aaron and ingratiate yourself with him. But this number won't work with me. After all this history at the Villa, you must have very different ambitions.}
{400}{}{你设法智胜亚伦，讨好他。但这个数字对我不起作用。在维拉度过了这么长的历史之后，你一定有着非常不同的抱负。}
### {401}{}{Thu... How are you...}
{401}{}{周四...你好吗}
### {402}{}{I know everything that happens in this city. There are eyes and ears everywhere. Of course, the Villa reports did not pass by. So what are you trying to achieve with all this conspiracy?}
{402}{}{我知道这个城市发生的一切。到处都是眼睛和耳朵。当然，维拉的报道并没有被忽略。那么，你想通过这些阴谋达到什么目的呢？}
### {403}{}{I only want freedom for my people.}
{403}{}{我只想让我的人民获得自由。}
### {404}{}{A worthy goal for a person who knows nothing about freedom. As the Ancients said, freedom has a price. Your little people are not able to survive and even more so to preserve freedom in this world. Your only way out is to join the progress and become a part of this world.}
{404}{}{对于一个对自由一无所知的人来说，这是一个有价值的目标。正如古人所说，自由是有代价的。你们的小人物无法生存，更无法在这个世界上维护自由。你唯一的出路就是加入进步，成为这个世界的一部分。}
### {405}{}{So... become a colony?}
{405}{}{所以…成为殖民地？}
### {406}{}{After such a long journey, I realize that the Villa has to change.}
{406}{}{经过这么长的旅程，我意识到维拉必须改变。}
### {407}{}{Hmm, curious. In that case, the only way out for your people is to become our colony.}
{407}{}{嗯，很好奇。在这种情况下，你们人民唯一的出路就是成为我们的殖民地。}
### {408}{}{A colony?}
{408}{}{殖民地？}
### {409}{}{Exactly. You will partially lose your independence, but in return you will receive a profitable exchange of knowledge, technologies and products. Everyone will be in the black, but there is one problem - your society must change. You will have to explain to your fellow tribesmen the need to destroy outdated traditions and transition to a new way of life.}
{409}{}{确切地你将部分失去独立性，但作为回报，你将获得有利可图的知识、技术和产品交流。每个人都将是黑人，但有一个问题――你们的社会必须改变。你必须向你的部落同胞解释，有必要摧毁过时的传统，过渡到新的生活方式。}
### {410}{}{It won't be easy. But I'll do whatever it takes. They'll listen to me.}
{410}{}{这并不容易。但我会不惜一切代价。他们会听我的。}
### {411}{}{Good. In this case, you will have to make a small and dangerous journey. Take this holodisk with an important message. It must be taken to the military base in the Steel Port. It is safest to move there accompanied by caravans.}
{411}{}{好的在这种情况下，你将不得不进行一次小而危险的旅行。拿着这个全息图和一个重要的信息。它必须被带到钢铁港的军事基地。在大篷车的陪同下前往那里是最安全的。}
### {412}{}{But what about the enslaved peasants?}
{412}{}{但是被奴役的农民呢？}
### {413}{}{You don't have to worry about it, I'll pass on the orders for their safety. But the issue of colonization should be decided by the General Staff. Get back to Puerto Penasco and show my report to the Commander-in-Chief.}
{413}{}{你不必担心，为了他们的安全，我会把命令传下去的。但殖民化问题应由总参谋部决定。回到佩纳斯科港，把我的报告给总司令看。}
### {414}{}{I'm leaving right now.}
{414}{}{我现在就走。}
### {415}{}{I've completed Aaron's assignments. Now I ask you to free the peasants of the Villa from bondage.}
{415}{}{我已经完成了亚伦的任务。现在我请求你把别墅里的农民从束缚中解放出来。}
### {1415}{}{I've completed Aaron's assignments. Now I ask you to free the peasants of the Villa from bondage.}
{1415}{}{我已经完成了亚伦的任务。现在我请求你把别墅里的农民从束缚中解放出来。}
### {416}{}{Your prowess amazes people like Aaron. But I have more information. What do you really want for your small and proud people?}
{416}{}{你的能力让像亚伦这样的人感到惊讶。但我有更多的信息。你真正想要的是那些渺小而自豪的人是什么？}
### {417}{}{What is this base to which you need to take the holodisk?}
{417}{}{你需要把全息盘带到什么基础上？}
### {418}{}{A military base in the port of Puerto Penasco on the shore of the Gulf of California. Few people know about it. You'll find out everything on the spot when you get there.}
{418}{}{位于加利福尼亚湾沿岸佩纳斯科港的一个军事基地。很少有人知道它。当你到达那里时，你会当场发现一切。}
### {419}{}{Clear. Can I ask other questions?}
{419}{}{清楚的我可以问其他问题吗？}
### {420}{}{I will go there immediately.}
{420}{}{我马上去那里。}
### {421}{}{I could explain a little bit. Well, okay, I'll go take a look.}
{421}{}{我可以解释一下。好吧，我去看看。}
### {422}{}{And what is written on the holodisc?}
{422}{}{全息图上写着什么？}
### {423}{}{A secret report to the General Staff, among other things, it relates to the situation with the Villa. Don't show the disk to anyone and don't try to read it, it's encrypted anyway.}
{423}{}{给总参谋部的一份秘密报告，除其他外，与别墅的情况有关。不要向任何人显示磁盘，也不要试图读取它，它无论如何都是加密的。}
### {424}{}{Looks like you've figured out my plan. I'll have to kill you!}
{424}{}{看来你已经想出了我的计划。我得杀了你！}
### {425}{}{That's enough! This will never happen. You are just robbers and extortionists.}
{425}{}{够了！这永远不会发生。你们只是强盗和勒索者。}
### {426}{}{What narrowness of views... It looks like you can't be of any use to us.}
{426}{}{多么狭隘的观点...看来你对我们没有任何用处。}
### {1426}{}{What narrowness of views... It looks like you can't be of any use to us.}
{1426}{}{多么狭隘的观点...看来你对我们没有任何用处。}
### {427}{}{Hey, is that a gun?}
{427}{}{嘿，那是把枪吗？}
