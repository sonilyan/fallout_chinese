#{300}{}{You can enter the elevator.}
{300}{}{你可以进入电梯。}

#{600}{}{I see, you're new here. So let me explain how basic security rules work around here.}
{600}{}{我明白了，你是新来的。让我来解释一下这里的基本安全规则是如何工作的。}
#{601}{}{Go on.}
{601}{}{继续。}
#{650}{}{It's simple. You tell the elevator guard, me in this case, your name and if you've got security clearance, he lets you in. You have to be registered in the system. Leonard will take care of that, so just talk to him if you haven't done that already. That's basically it. And just let me warn you that if guards spot someone who shouldn't be on a certain level, they'll shoot without warning. We accept everybody into the Rebirth, that's why we have to be cautious.}
{650}{}{很简单。你告诉电梯保安，在这种情况下告诉我，你的名字，如果你有安全许可证，他会让你进去。你必须在系统中注册。莱纳德会处理好的，如果你还没做的话就跟他谈谈。基本上就是这样。我要警告你，如果守卫发现有人不应该在某个高度，他们会毫无预兆地开枪。我们接受每个人的重生，这就是为什么我们要谨慎。}

You gain access to the third level only if you have some job allocated that requires it. Besides various technicians it's also us guards and soldiers, because the storeroom is located there. And only those with a thorough background check, who serve the Rebirth for several years, can gain access to red levels, and even to Blue 6. Scientific research is conducted there and most importantly, the machine of the rebirth, and the Savior are there.}
