#Gustavo Obanel Vallejo at your service. I'm the manager of San Isidro. Now, to hell with the niceties. I want to know the reason why you're disturbing our posthumous peace. We don't tolerate smooth-skinned racists here. Our family has suffered enough from you. So explain clearly and without lying ? why should we tolerate your presence?
### {201}{}{To hell with ghouls. I'm here for profit. I was told you can make good money here.}
{201}{}{和食尸鬼见鬼去吧。我来这里是为了盈利。有人告诉我你在这里可以赚很多钱。}

{1207}{}{我不是种族主义者。我崇拜你，食尸鬼，我愿意和你一起生活。}
### {208}{}{You have such a slippery skin that you will be with us for sweets, normie. I won't tolerate any more lies. But I'll give you one chance. You will cope - and you will have hugs with ghouls for the rest of your days.}
{208}{}{你皮肤太滑了，你会和我们一起吃糖的，诺米。我再也不能容忍谎言了。但我给你一次机会。你会应付的――在接下来的日子里，你会和食尸鬼拥抱在一起。}

### {211}{}{Thank you, brother. So what would I do in this beautiful city?}
{211}{}{谢谢你，兄弟。那么，在这个美丽的城市我该做什么呢？}

{212}{}{夜光仍然无法发光。你可以去车站帮我们的工人把电还给城市。我会给你丰厚的报酬，让你在圣伊西德罗度过余生。}

### {1221}{}{This is some kind of coincidence. The entrance was open, so I went in.}
{1221}{}{这是某种巧合。入口是敞开的，所以我进去了。}
### {222}{}{Hmm, if I find out that you're lying, I'll personally rip off your slippery skin and sprinkle radioactive ash on the bleeding meat. You will feel all the pain that ghouls experience every day of their lives.}
{222}{}{嗯，如果我发现你在撒谎，我会亲自扯下你光滑的皮肤，在流血的肉上撒上放射性灰。你会感受到食尸鬼每天所经历的痛苦。}
### {223}{}{I believe every word. But who are you?}
{223}{}{我相信每一个字。但你是谁？}
### {224}{}{That ghoul threatened me. I was just defending myself.}

### {226}{}{You have no right to set boundaries. This wasteland is for everyone, not just you.}
{226}{}{你无权设定界限。这片荒地适合所有人，而不仅仅是你。}
### {227}{}{We just want to live like normal people. Without wars. Without grandiose missions to save humanity. You may not understand this. But since you're here, you don't have much choice ? to redeem yourself or... die.}
{227}{}{我们只想像普通人一样生活。没有战争。没有拯救人类的宏伟使命。你可能不理解这一点。但既然你来了，你就别无选择了? 救赎自己或者...死亡}
### {228}{}{I choose death. Your death!}
{228}{}{我选择死亡。你的死！}
### {229}{}{Shall we try to negotiate? By the way, we haven't introduced ourselves yet.}

### {233}{}{Certainly not me. So you run everything here?}
{233}{}{当然不是我。所以你在这里管理一切？}
### {234}{}{To live here, you have to work. Even a mutant like you should understand that. We have enough freeloaders without you.}

### {235}{}{I understand...}
{235}{}{我明白...}
### {236}{}{Any ideas how to fix a radio station?}
{236}{}{你知道如何修理一个电台吗？}

{1252}{}{你在干什么，光滑的脸？}

{253}{}{看看我们这里有谁。光滑的枪口要求打得好。别担心，我会把你的皮移植到我的尸体上。在此期间，你会告诉我一切。}

### {264}{}{Thank you.}
{264}{}{非常感谢。}
### {265}{}{Not bad.}
{265}{}{不错。}
### {266}{}{I also owe you an apology. I gave this assignment in the expectation that robots or radiation would kill you. And there will be one less smooth-skinned in the Glow. But I was wrong. You can stay in our city as long as you want.}
{266}{}{我也应该向你道歉。我做这项任务是希望机器人或辐射会杀死你。在Glow中会有一个不那么光滑的皮肤。但我错了。你想在我们城市呆多久就呆多久。}

{267}{}{我理解你，我不怪你。}
### {268}{}{Don't expect me to shake your hand after this.}
{268}{}{别指望我在这之后会和你握手。}
### {1268}{}{Don't expect me to hug you after that.}
{1268}{}{别指望我会在那之后拥抱你。}
### {269}{}{Now that we have electricity, we need to restore the broken radio station. She is in the next room. This task is just for you.}
{269}{}{现在我们有电了，我们需要修复坏了的电台。她在隔壁房间。这项任务只适合你。}
### {270}{}{Isn't she too broken? Are you sure it can be repaired?}
{270}{}{她是不是太崩溃了？你确定它可以修理吗？}
### {271}{}{Fix it ? no. She needs a replacement. I know that the patrol center operates one of the same. And I'll pay if you bring the parts from there.}
{271}{}{修复它? 没有。她需要一个替代品。我知道巡逻中心也是这样运作的。如果你把零件从那里带来，我会付钱的。}
### {272}{}{OK. I'll try.}
{272}{}{好的，我试试。}
### {273}{}{If I'm in the mood, then I'll try. In the meantime, I don't want to do this. Bye.}
{273}{}{如果我有心情，我会试试的。与此同时，我不想这样做。再见}
### {274}{}{The radio station is working. More precisely, I had to replace it with a new one from the border guards office.}
{274}{}{电台正在工作。更确切地说，我不得不用边防办公室的一个新的来代替它。}
### {275}{}{Here's another great news in this scorched world! And I like you more and more, smooth-skinned. You're just like me when I was young.}
{275}{}{在这个焦灼的世界里，又有一个好消息！我越来越喜欢你，皮肤光滑。你就像我年轻时一样。}

### {277}{}{Not the most pleasant comparison, you know.}
{277}{}{你知道，这不是最令人愉快的比较。}
### {278}{}{Let's just not hug, okay?}
{278}{}{我们不要拥抱，好吗？}
### {279}{}{Let's not waste time. Here are 500 caps for the job. And now I'm asking you to take this holodisk to Mayor Butler in the Old Town. This is very important.}
{279}{}{我们不要浪费时间。这是这份工作的500个瓶盖。现在我请你把这个全息图带给老城区的巴特勒市长。这一点非常重要。}

{289}{}{我会尽力回答的。}
### {290}{}{Is it that important to you?}
{290}{}{对你来说有那么重要吗？}
### {291}{}{We need this radio station. The areas of Glow are torn apart by impassable ruins, and radiation is jamming the usual weak radio. Constant communication will change the whole city. Try for the sake of all of us.}
{291}{}{我们需要这个电台。Glow地区被无法通行的废墟撕裂，辐射干扰了通常微弱的无线电。不断的交流将改变整个城市。为我们所有人的利益而努力。}
### {292}{}{And what is recorded on this disc?}

{297}{}{有两种方法。你可以直接沿着805号联邦公路走，然后从标志处向东转弯。但这条公路有军用机器人巡逻。一条不那么危险的道路穿过Chula Vista的有毒沼泽。}

{298}{}{好吧，我会试着找到它。}

#Questions
### {300}{}{Can I ask a few questions?}
{300}{}{我能问几个问题吗？}
### {301}{}{Amigo, I'm always happy to listen to you and answer your questions. But there are more important things to do now. You know what to do.}
{301}{}{Amigo，我很乐意听你说话，回答你的问题。但现在还有更重要的事情要做。你知道该怎么做。}
### {302}{}{It's better if you get busy. You know what I mean.}
{302}{}{如果你忙起来会更好。你知道我的意思。}
### {303}{}{No talking. I'm not sure it's worth talking to you at all.}
{303}{}{不要说话。我不确定是否值得和你谈谈。}
### {304}{}{I understand. We'll talk some time later.}
{304}{}{我理解。我们稍后再谈。}
### {305}{}{I would say that you just don't want to see me. Bye.}

### {307}{}{Okay, see you later.}
{307}{}{好的，回头见。}

### {310}{}{I want to know more about you.}
{310}{}{我想更多地了解你。}
### {311}{}{Who am I? Strange question. I was a doctor once. But the War nullified my license. Now, as you can see, I run a small town. You can learn everything if life forces you to.}
{311}{}{我是谁？奇怪的问题。我曾经是一名医生。但是战争取消了我的执照。现在，正如你所看到的，我经营着一个小镇。如果生活迫使你学习，你可以学到一切。}
### {312}{}{By the way, about this town. I don't understand, so where is the Dayglow then? What is it?}
{312}{}{顺便说一下，关于这个小镇。我不明白，那么夜光在哪里呢？它是什么？}
### {313}{}{It's in our heart. Glow is a ghoul's dream. The dream of a city where we can safely meet old age. And San Isidro is one of his neighborhoods. The old border wall protects us here.}
{313}{}{它在我们心中。辉光是食尸鬼的梦想。一个城市的梦想，在那里我们可以安全地迎接老年。圣伊西德罗是他的一个社区。古老的边境墙保护着我们。}
### {314}{}{So your goal is to build a Glow?}
{314}{}{所以你的目标是建立一个辉光？}
### {315}{}{A city for ghouls is my goal. We just want to live like normal people. Without harassment. Without wars. Without grandiose missions to save humanity.}
{315}{}{一个食尸鬼之城是我的目标。我们只想像普通人一样生活。没有骚扰。没有战争。没有拯救人类的宏伟使命。}
### {316}{}{I see.}
{316}{}{我明白了。}
### {317}{}{Does the Old City also aspire to this paradise?}
{317}{}{老城也向往这个天堂吗？}
### {318}{}{It's not like the Old Town shares your dream.}
{318}{}{这不像是老城区分享你的梦想。}
### {319}{}{The Old Town is making a mistake. He is too close to the caravan trail and therefore cannot get rid of the corrupting influence of the normies from the northern cities.}
{319}{}{老城区犯了一个错误。他离商队路线太近了，因此无法摆脱北方城市正常人的腐败影响。}
### {320}{}{How do I get to the Old Town?}
{320}{}{我怎么去老城？}
### {321}{}{Go north. You can go straight through the piers, in the most radioactive heat. Or you can make a detour through the ruins of the suburbs, providing yourself with new and not always welcome meetings.}
{321}{}{往北走。在放射性最强的高温下，你可以直接穿过码头。或者你可以绕道穿过郊区的废墟，为自己提供新的、并不总是受欢迎的会议。}
### {322}{}{Clear.}
{322}{}{清楚的}
### {323}{}{What is the Dayglow? Where is it located?}
{323}{}{什么是夜光？它在哪里？}
### {324}{}{Which city are you trying to build?}
{324}{}{你想建哪个城市？}
### {325}{}{It will be the city as it would have been a hundred years ago. We're collecting everything that's left of the Old World. No one cares about us here, so we can relax and live out our lives in peace.}
{325}{}{这将是一座一百年前的城市。我们正在收集旧世界剩下的一切。这里没有人关心我们，所以我们可以放松下来，平静地生活。}
### {326}{}{Tell me about yourself.}
{326}{}{告诉我你自己。}

### {350}{}{I gave the holodisk to Butler. Your message didn't convince him.}
{350}{}{我把全息盘给了巴特勒。你的信息没有说服他。}
### {1350}{}{I gave the holodisk to Butler. Your message didn't convince him.}
{1350}{}{我把全息盘给了巴特勒。你的信息没有说服他。}
### {351}{}{Not surprising. John and I are arguing about the Dayglow. About how the city of ghouls should be. He pays too much attention to the normies and completely forgot that we are people of the Old World. We can revive the city, rebuild it anew! Yes, the ghouls are weak, but we have remnants of old cars and energy. With the help of technology, we can create for ourselves all the necessary conditions for life, even in the midst of scorched ruins.}
{351}{}{这并不奇怪。约翰和我在为“夜光”争论。关于食尸鬼之城应该是什么样子。他太关注普通人了，完全忘记了我们是旧世界的人。我们可以复兴这座城市，重建它！是的，食尸鬼很虚弱，但我们有旧汽车和能源的残余。在技术的帮助下，我们可以为自己创造一切必要的生活条件，即使是在烧焦的废墟中。}
### {352}{}{By the way, after reading the holodisk, he asked me to help him in the production of chips at the aircraft factory.}
{352}{}{顺便说一句，在阅读了全息图之后，他让我帮助他在飞机工厂生产芯片。}
### {353}{}{What a fool! This plant will still serve us, the gulyams. Don't give the chips to the Old Town, give them to me. Our technician uses them to repair robots, and with their help we will restore the city. This will give us more advantages in the future than a stupid exchange for food from the caravaneers.}
{353}{}{真是个傻瓜！这种植物仍然会为我们服务，古利亚姆人。不要把芯片给老城，给我。我们的技术人员用它们来修理机器人，在他们的帮助下，我们将恢复这座城市。这将在未来给我们带来更多的优势，而不是从房车司机那里愚蠢地交换食物。}
### {354}{}{I'll think about it.}
{354}{}{我会考虑的。}
### {355}{}{OK. I will do so.}
{355}{}{好的，我会的。}
### {356}{}{I knew you'd say that, so I took these chips with me in advance. Here they are.}
{356}{}{我知道你会这么说，所以我提前带上了这些筹码。它们在这儿。}
### {1356}{}{I knew you'd say that, so I took these chips with me in advance. Here they are.}
{1356}{}{我知道你会这么说，所以我提前带上了这些筹码。它们在这儿。}
### {357}{}{Thank you. Here are 1000 caps for the job. The plant will also serve us. You can't leave him to be torn to pieces. I think you should personally tell John that the plant is under my control and that I will not give him the chips.}
{357}{}{非常感谢。这是这份工作的1000个瓶盖。植物也会为我们服务。你不能让他被撕成碎片。我认为你应该亲自告诉约翰，工厂在我的控制之下，我不会给他筹码。}
### {358}{}{Okay.}
{358}{}{可以}
### {359}{}{Here are the chips that Butler wanted to sell. But he won't be able to.}
{359}{}{这是巴特勒想卖的筹码。但他做不到。}
### {360}{}{Then I have bad news for you ? Butler has already taken the chips and is preparing to sell them.}
{360}{}{那我有个坏消息要告诉你? 巴特勒已经拿到了筹码，正准备把它们卖掉。}
### {361}{}{This is really bad news. I think you should keep an eye on Butler. Let me know if you find out what new he's up to.}
{361}{}{这真是个坏消息。我认为你应该关注巴特勒。如果你知道他在干什么，请告诉我。}
### {362}{}{OK.}
{362}{}{好啊}
### {363}{}{I have bad news for you ? Butler has already taken the chips and is preparing to sell them.}
{363}{}{我有个坏消息要告诉你? 巴特勒已经拿到了筹码，正准备把它们卖掉。}
### {364}{}{Yes, and also ? let me know what Butler is up to if you find out.}
{364}{}{是的，而且? 如果你发现了，让我知道巴特勒在干什么。}
### {365}{}{OK.}
{365}{}{好啊}

### {370}{}{Butler is going to open a military base on the island...}
{370}{}{巴特勒将在岛上开设一个军事基地...}
### {371}{}{He's making a mistake! He will sell most of the finds to people! And this will provoke a big redistribution in human settlements. As soon as the war with super mutants has subsided, the battles for old technologies will begin again. Normies don't understand how to handle the legacy of the Old World. Besides, they can use it against us. Technology should stay for free! We need them more. And we know better how to use them.}
