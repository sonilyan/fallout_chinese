### {208}{}{We honor the Brotherhood of Steel. You have given us Energy and taught us how to use many forgotten technologies. How can we help one of the metal brothers?}
{208}{}{我们向钢铁兄弟会致敬。你们给了我们能量，教会了我们如何使用许多被遗忘的技术。我们该如何帮助其中一个金属兄弟？}

{209}{}{事实上，我想见我的亲人。他们在这儿吗？}

### {233}{}{What is a former scout of the Brotherhood of Steel doing here?}
{233}{}{钢铁兄弟会的前侦察员在这里干什么？}
### {234}{}{The Steel Gods have fallen. Their Olympus was destroyed by a nuclear explosion. But some managed to survive. Despite the loss of their former greatness, they still carry unique skills and knowledge inaccessible to mere mortals. We will kindly provide them with Vault. But on our terms.}
{234}{}{钢铁之神已经倒下了。他们的奥林巴斯被核爆炸摧毁了。但有些人成功地活了下来。尽管他们失去了昔日的伟大，但他们仍然拥有凡人无法企及的独特技能和知识。我们将为他们提供保险库。但按照我们的条件。}
### {235}{}{In other words, do you want to extract all the useful information from them and use it at your discretion?}
{235}{}{换句话说，你想从他们那里提取所有有用的信息并自行使用吗？}

### {238}{}{Well, it seems that one steel god will have a difficult life for a mere mortal.}
{238}{}{看来一个钢铁之神对于一个凡人来说生活会很艰难。}

### {240}{}{How can I save my fellow tribesmen?}
{240}{}{我该如何拯救我的部落同胞？}
### {241}{}{The only way is to go to the Forbidden Zone and find slaves. To get back out, you'll have to disable the internal security systems. This is a severe test even for tinsmiths. The chances of surviving in the Forbidden Zone are small. Talk to the instructor when you're ready to go.}
{241}{}{唯一的办法就是去禁区找奴隶。要退出，你必须禁用内部安全系统。这对锡匠来说也是一个严峻的考验。在禁区内生存的几率很小。准备出发时与教练交谈。}
### {242}{}{Why is the Restricted Area so important to you?}
{242}{}{为什么禁区对你如此重要？}
### {243}{}{People of the last era brought military equipment there. Over the years, a huge territory has been filled with the most valuable deposits of technology, and the center of this repository is knowledge and drawings. With free access to this repository, we could bring ancient technologies back to life. And with them the greatness of Progress throughout the Wasteland!}
{243}{}{上个时代的人们把军事装备带到了那里。多年来，一个巨大的领域充满了最有价值的技术储备，而这个储存库的中心是知识和图纸。通过免费访问这个存储库，我们可以让古老的技术复活。和他们在一起的是整个荒原上的伟大进步！}

{244}{}{你知道以后该怎么办吗？}
### {245}{}{The Brotherhood of Steel will help in the wise use of these finds for the benefit of all mankind. We, as servants of Progress, are obliged to help the Brotherhood.}
{245}{}{钢铁兄弟会将帮助明智地利用这些发现，造福全人类。作为进步的仆人，我们有义务帮助兄弟会。}
### {246}{}{What kind of Brotherhood is this?}
{246}{}{这是什么兄弟会？}
### {247}{}{Don't you know? Not surprising. Maybe you shouldn't know, but I'll tell you. The Brotherhood of Steel is one of the military units of a bygone era. A small fragment of the past that came to our lands to revive the Old World. A worthy goal for which we tinkerers are ready to sacrifice our Tension. We also strive to have Two Suns shining over the world again.}
{247}{}{你不知道吗？这并不奇怪。也许你不应该知道，但我会告诉你的。钢铁兄弟会是过去时代的军事单位之一。过去的一小部分来到我们的土地上复兴旧世界。这是一个有价值的目标，我们修修补补者准备为此牺牲我们的紧张局势。我们也努力让两个太阳再次照耀世界。}
### {248}{}{Two Suns? I only know about one thing.}
{248}{}{两个太阳？我只知道一件事。}
### {249}{}{That's right, a pathetic man of flesh and blood. You only know the sun that shines in the sky and gives warmth to the maize shoots. But you don't know the charms of Nuclear Energy, which shines much brighter.}
{249}{}{没错，一个可怜的有血有肉的人。你只知道阳光在天空中照耀，给玉米芽带来温暖。但你不知道核能的魅力，因为它更加明亮。}
### {250}{}{By the way, where is this Brotherhood of Steel?}
{250}{}{顺便问一下，这个钢铁兄弟会在哪里？}
### {251}{}{You don't deserve an answer, stranger.}
{251}{}{你不配得到答案，陌生人。}
### {1251}{}{You don't deserve an answer, stranger.}
{1251}{}{你不配得到答案，陌生人。}
### {252}{}{You deserve an answer. Go west past Casa Nueva. And on the shore of the Gulf of California you will find a Steel Port - this is the citadel of the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{252}{}{你应该得到一个答案。往西经过努瓦之家。在加利福尼亚湾的岸边，你会发现一个钢铁港――这是钢铁兄弟会的堡垒。}
### {253}{}{Who are you?}
{253}{}{你是谁？}
### {254}{}{Outsiders call us tinsmiths because our passion is ancient technology. We devoted ourselves to their service, sacrificing even our mortal human bodies. Because technology will save the world and will not let it finally fade away. People will live as long as Two Suns shine, otherwise they will be degraded to the level of savages. And this time the process will be irreversible.}
{254}{}{外界称我们为锡匠，是因为我们对古老技术的热爱。我们献身于他们的服务，甚至牺牲了我们凡人的身体。因为技术将拯救世界，不会让它最终消失。只要两个太阳发光，人们就会活得很长，否则他们就会堕落到野蛮人的水平。而这一次，这个过程将是不可逆转的。}
### {255}{}{Are you somehow connected with the Followers of Fire?}
{255}{}{你是否与火的追随者有某种联系？}
### {256}{}{A church that was created to carry the banner of Progress, but in words more understandable to commoners. We respect and cooperate with these funny people in cassocks, because their faith makes people closer to our ideas about the world. But they are one fee below us.}
{256}{}{这座教堂是为了高举进步的旗帜而创建的，但用通俗易懂的语言来说。我们尊重并与这些穿着袈裟的有趣的人合作，因为他们的信仰使人们更接近我们对世界的看法。但他们比我们低一笔费用。}
### {257}{}{So this is where they bring uranium from Flagstaff?}
{257}{}{所以这就是他们从弗拉格斯塔夫运铀的地方？}
### {258}{}{Energy requires fuel. And we need a lot of energy. If it weren't for the greed of primitive creatures from Phoenix and other settlements, we would get all the uranium from Flagstaff.}
{258}{}{能源需要燃料。我们需要大量的能量。如果不是因为凤凰城和其他定居点的原始生物的贪婪，我们会从弗拉格斯塔夫得到所有的铀。}
### {259}{}{What will you do now that the uranium mines are ruined?}
{259}{}{既然铀矿被毁了，你会怎么办？}
### {260}{}{As before, look for remnants of pre-war resources. We rely on the Forbidden Zone, it holds a great many resources and secrets.}
{260}{}{和以前一样，寻找战前资源的残余。我们依靠的是紫禁城，它蕴藏着大量的资源和秘密。}
### {261}{}{Is it ethical to send people to their deaths?}
{261}{}{送人送死合乎道德吗？}
### {262}{}{Existence in the wastelands is survival. So let these savages survive in the Forbidden Zone and thereby benefit Progress and the whole world. Every life in our time is valuable no more than a cog in a huge machine.}
{262}{}{在荒原上生存就是生存。因此，让这些野蛮人在禁区内生存，从而造福进步和整个世界。我们这个时代的每一个生命都只不过是一台巨大机器上的一个齿轮。}
### {263}{}{What if the slaves manage to disable the protection?}
{263}{}{如果奴隶设法禁用了保护呢？}
### {264}{}{Anyone who brings a valuable artifact from the Forbidden Zone, and even more so turns off the protective system, is waiting for freedom and the ascension of honors. We tinsmiths keep our word.}
{264}{}{任何从禁区带来贵重文物，甚至关闭保护系统的人，都在等待自由和荣誉的提升。我们锡匠信守诺言。}
### {265}{}{Do you know that the Brotherhood of Steel is no more?}
{265}{}{你知道钢铁兄弟会已经不复存在了吗？}
### {266}{}{Only some Progress relays are missing. Other followers will take their place. The Steel Port was not the main conduit in the network of this great organization. Their general staff is located in California and is still functioning. Someday Arizona will feel the weight of the metal of the Brotherhood of Steel again.}
{266}{}{只有一些进度继电器丢失。其他追随者将取代他们的位置。钢铁港并不是这个伟大组织网络中的主要管道。他们的总参谋部设在加利福尼亚州，目前仍在运作。总有一天，亚利桑那州将再次感受到钢铁兄弟会金属的重量。}
### {267}{}{Now that the Temple of Fire has been destroyed, are you less trusting of this cult?}
{267}{}{现在火神庙已经被摧毁了，你是不是对这个邪教不那么信任了？}
### {268}{}{The faith of this church does not matter to us. Another thing is important - with her help, Arizona learned about Progress. It remains for us to properly use this opportunity and continue to broadcast our ideas by taking the vacant place in Phoenix.}
{268}{}{这个教会的信仰对我们来说并不重要。另一件事很重要――在她的帮助下，亚利桑那州了解了进步。我们仍然需要好好利用这个机会，并通过占据凤凰城的空缺继续传播我们的想法。}

### {270}{}{You've lost your humanity. And he became a soulless robot. You need to be unplugged, you fucking freak.}
{270}{}{你失去了人性。他变成了一个没有灵魂的机器人。你需要拔掉插头，你这个该死的怪胎。}
### {271}{}{All I know is that this energy destroyed the Old World. Are you going to do the same?}
{271}{}{我只知道这种能量摧毁了旧世界。你也要这么做吗？}
### {272}{}{We are not going to repeat the mistakes of our ancestors. We have studied their experience and become wiser. Technology should bring back civilization.}
{272}{}{我们不会重蹈祖先的覆辙。我们学习了他们的经验，变得更聪明了。技术应该带回文明。}
### {273}{}{People like you shouldn't even be allowed near a wrench. I will destroy you before you destroy the whole world.}
{273}{}{像你这样的人甚至不应该被允许靠近扳手。在你毁灭整个世界之前，我会先毁灭你。}
### {274}{}{I need time to think about your words. See you... maybe.}
{274}{}{我需要时间想想你的话。再见大概}
### {275}{}{How interesting. I would like to know more about you and your ideas.}
{275}{}{真有趣。我想更多地了解你和你的想法。}
### {276}{}{You know, you're right. Because of a few mistakes in the past, we should not limit ourselves in development.}
{276}{}{你知道，你是对的。因为过去的一些错误，我们不应该限制自己的发展。}
### {277}{}{It's good that your tiny biological brain is able to accept this.}
{277}{}{你小小的生物大脑能够接受这一点是件好事。}
### {278}{}{Yes, uh, but I have a few more questions.}
{278}{}{是的，但是我还有几个问题。}

### {300}{}{The Forbidden Zone is now under your control, Master Hard.}
{300}{}{禁地现在在你的控制之下，硬法师。}
### {301}{}{ZAX has fallen! His sacred artifacts will return to us, the people for whom they were created. This is a great day for our entire nation. The beginning of a new era.}
{301}{}{ZAX倒下了！他的神圣文物将回归我们，回归为之创造的人们。这对我们整个国家来说都是伟大的一天。一个新时代的开始。}
### {302}{}{Suppose you're right. But what about my people?}
{302}{}{假设你是对的。但我的人呢？}
### {303}{}{I demand the liberation of my people from slavery.}
{303}{}{我要求把我的人民从奴隶制中解放出来。}
### {304}{}{You and your people deserve freedom. You can go now. But know that we are only part of a common mechanism. Just like you. Someday the Brotherhood of Steel will come to your homes. What will you do? Be reasonable and surrender to the will of Progress. This is the only way for you to survive in the New World.}
{304}{}{你和你的人民应该得到自由。你现在可以走了。但要知道，我们只是一个共同机制的一部分。就像你一样。总有一天，钢铁兄弟会会来到你的家。你会怎么做？理智一点，服从进步的意志。这是你在新世界生存的唯一途径。}
### {305}{}{I'll think about your offer. In the meantime, I have to go.}
{305}{}{我会考虑你的报价。在此期间，我得走了。}
### {306}{}{And what does the Brotherhood of Steel have to do with it?}
{306}{}{钢铁兄弟会和它有什么关系？}
### {307}{}{We are only servants of these gods. They rule our lands in the name of Progress. They manage our resources and technologies for the development of the entire Wasteland. The story of the enslavement of the Villa was only part of this process. You are lucky to be in the center of a great change.}
{307}{}{我们只是这些神的仆人。他们以进步的名义统治着我们的土地。他们管理我们的资源和技术，以开发整个荒原。别墅被奴役的故事只是这个过程的一部分。你很幸运能处于一个巨大变化的中心。}
### {308}{}{Your point of view... deserves attention.}
{308}{}{你的观点。。。值得关注。}
### {309}{}{Rub this nonsense into the rest of the tinkerers, but not me.}

### {352}{}{Then tell me your "official" version.}
{352}{}{然后告诉我你的“官方”版本。}

{353}{}{多么傲慢的要求。但你会得到一个善意的回答。我们没有绑架科迪，而是把他从资不抵债的父母手中买下，当时他们甚至无法养活自己。}
### {354}{}{Was it that bad in Casa Grande?}
{354}{}{格兰德之家有那么糟糕吗？}

{355}{}{与此同时，这个悲惨的定居点需要紧急修理水泵。我们是唯一能解决这个问题的人。作为回报，人们捐出了他们为数不多的储备。商品中有科迪。这对我们团队来说是一笔宝贵的收购。}
### {356}{}{Why do you need children?}{357}{}{Our society knows the technology, but there are certain problems with childbearing. Taking a three-year-old child and re-educating them according to their principles is one of the ways to maintain our population. The child gets survival and a decent future.}
{356}{}{Why do you need children?}{357}{}{我们的社会知道这项技术，但生育也存在一些问题。带着一个三岁的孩子，按照他们的原则对他们进行再教育，是维持我们人口的方法之一。孩子得到了生存和体面的未来。}
### {358}{}{You don't think his real story will remain a secret, do you?}
{358}{}{你不认为他的真实故事会是个秘密，是吗？}
### {359}{}{Stupid sentimentality. From now on, Cody is a member of our Team. He is a stranger to the outside world.}
