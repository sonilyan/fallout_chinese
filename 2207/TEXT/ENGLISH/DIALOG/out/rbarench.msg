{1002}{}{[他向你致敬]你好吗，冠军？变得嗜血？哈每个人最终都会回到这里。。。它带给你的不仅仅是滴滴答答。}

### {1005}{}{[with a grim look, he polishes his bald head with a dirty cloth] Oh, it's you... Sorry, I don't feel like talking today. The Hog... I had a dream - to see someone who could beat him in the Arena! Instead, he was murdered in a ditch, like Lavash in a slaughterhouse...}
{1005}{}{[他神情严肃，用脏布擦着光头]哦，是你。。。对不起，我今天不想说话。猪。。。我做了一个梦――在竞技场上看到一个能打败他的人！相反，他是在一条沟里被谋杀的，就像屠宰场里的拉瓦什一样。。。}
### {1016}{015}{Life is a bitch, huh? Still, is there anyone who wants to fight me?}
{1016}{015}{生活是个婊子养的，是吗？不过，有人想和我打架吗？}
### {1017}{014}{Can I make a bet though?}
{1017}{014}{我可以打赌吗？}
### {1018}{012}{I have a small favor to ask - just to pick up something from the Arena.}
{1018}{012}{我有一个小小的请求――只是想从竞技场上取些东西。}
### {1019}{999}{I won't bother you then.}
{1019}{999}{那我就不麻烦你了。}
### {1006}{}{[Warden looks lost, despite his huge size] What happens now?... Everything is going to hell... [he notices you] What do you come here for?}
{1006}{}{[典狱长看起来很失落，尽管他身材魁梧]现在发生了什么？。。。一切都在走向地狱。。。[他注意到你了]你来这里干什么？}

{1023}{999}{只是检查一下。很高兴见到你，但我得走了。}


### {110}{}{[he spreads his arms] This is the Arena! You haven't seen the Rainbow if you didn't visit this place! Here the boys with the balls of metal turn each other into a bloody pulp to the roaring of the crowd! Even observing the Chimeras in their mating season can't compare to this! As for me, you can call me Warden. I'm leading this place, so - tell me, if you need something.}
{110}{}{[他张开双臂]这就是竞技场！如果你不去这个地方，你就没见过彩虹！在这里，带着金属球的男孩们在人群的咆哮中把彼此变成了血腥的果肉！即使在交配季节观察嵌合体也无法与此相比！至于我，你可以叫我典狱长。我在领导这个地方，所以，如果你需要什么，告诉我。}
### {111}{014}{Can I make bets here?}
{111}{014}{我可以在这里下注吗？}
### {112}{015}{Sounds good... I might even want to participate. Is that possible?}
{112}{015}{听起来不错。。。我甚至可能想参加。这可能吗？}
### {113}{999}{I see. Okay, see you around, Warden.}
{113}{999}{我明白了。好吧，回头见，典狱长。}


### {1201}{}{And I'd like a blowjob from both of Hog's bitches simultaneously. Want to get to the Arena? Come and fight. That's the rule.}
{1201}{}{我想让霍格的两个婊子同时吹口哨。想去竞技场吗？来战斗吧。这就是规则。}
### {121}{013}{Here's how it is... That thing belonged to one Seeker, who's at the Bar now. Get it? He's always going around Radius, knows every nook. You would want to have a friend like him. And if I can't go to Arena, maybe you could help? It's a badge, you can't mix it up. And I'll have a word with him for you.  }
{121}{013}{事情是这样的…那东西属于一个现在在酒吧的探索者。明白了吗？他总是围着Radius转，知道每一个角落。你会希望有一个像他一样的朋友。如果我不能去竞技场，也许你可以帮忙？这是一个徽章，你不能把它弄混。我会替你和他谈谈的。}
### {122}{015}{This is definitely an option. Is there anyone ready to stand against me?}
{122}{015}{这绝对是一个选择。有人准备好反对我了吗？}
### {123}{999}{If that's how it is - I'd better go.}
{123}{999}{如果是这样的话，我最好去。}
### {1202}{}{No problem, champ! You can stop asking because this is your second home now! Haha!}
{1202}{}{没问题，冠军！你可以不再问了，因为这是你的第二个家！哈哈！}
### {124}{999}{Man, it really is! Be well, Warden.}
{124}{999}{伙计，真的！好好的，典狱长。}
### {1203}{}{[he is staring into some burned book, slowly moving his lips.] What? To pick up something? Is it about taking out the trash? It's about time for you to show up. Go to Arena, don't bother me. And come earlier next time.}
{1203}{}{[他盯着一本烧过的书，慢慢地动了动嘴唇。]什么？去捡东西？是关于倒垃圾吗？你该露面了。去竞技场吧，别打扰我。下次早点来。}
### {125}{999}{Uh... Yeah, thanks. I'm going.}
{125}{999}{嗯是的，谢谢。我要走了。}


### {130}{}{Well, yeah, but... Wait for a moment... [he leaves. You observe local flies for some time, then he returns] Here. But if you try to fuck me up, I'll give you a lot of unforgettable moments in the Arena. [he smiles, showing his metal teeth]}
{130}{}{嗯，是的，但是。。。等一下。。。[他离开了。你观察当地的苍蝇一段时间，然后他回来了]这里。但如果你想搞砸我，我会在竞技场给你很多难忘的时刻。[他微笑着，露出他的金属牙齿]}
### {131}{999}{Everything's going to be alright, man! Don't you doubt it. Okay, see you around.}
{131}{999}{一切都会好起来的，伙计！别怀疑。好的，回头见。}
### {132}{999}{Did I ever lie to you? No! Let's not waste time then. Thanks again, for your help.}
{132}{999}{我曾经骗过你吗？不那我们就不要浪费时间了。再次感谢您的帮助。}


### {140}{}{[his eyes are flashing] Bets? Bets are good... Of course, come closer and join our celebration! No sweat! It's easy - here's one fighter, here's another. Look at them, pick any. Bets are 1 to 3.}
{140}{}{[他的眼睛在闪烁]打赌？赌注很高。。。当然，走近一点，加入我们的庆祝活动吧！举手之劳这很容易――这是一个战士，这是另一个。看看他们，随便挑一个。赌注是1比3。}
### {141}{016}{Let's start with a small one - I'm betting fifty.}
{141}{016}{让我们从一个小的开始――我赌五十。}
### {142}{016}{Here's a hundred, wish me luck!}
{142}{016}{这是一百，祝我好运！}
### {143}{016}{Two hundred or nothing!}
{143}{016}{两百或者什么都没有！}
### {144}{015}{Actually, I prefer to earn my coin with my fists. Can you do something about that?}
{144}{015}{事实上，我更喜欢用拳头挣硬币。你能做点什么吗？}
### {145}{999}{No. Not today.}
{145}{999}{不，今天不行。}

### {220}{}{You do realize that we have one-on-one fights only? [looks at your brother] Let the gentleman stand aside.}
{220}{}{你知道我们只有一对一的打斗吗？[看着你哥哥]让这位先生靠边站。}
### {221}{}{You do realize that we have one-on-one fights only? [looks at robotron] This bucket of yours is going to destroy my whole Arena! Turn it off for now.}
{221}{}{你知道我们只有一对一的打斗吗？[看着robotron]你的这个桶要毁了我的整个竞技场！暂时把它关掉。}
### {222}{}{You do realize that we have one-on-one fights only? [looks at Shaggy]. No animals. Especially Fire Wolves! Tell him to sit somewhere nearby.}
{222}{}{你知道我们只有一对一的打斗吗？[看着沙吉]。没有动物。尤其是火狼！让他坐在附近的某个地方。}
### {226}{}{You do realize that we have one-on-one fights only? [looks at Ludwig, who is trying to hide behind you] I see that you are, uh, "close", but you are not going to Arena together.}
{226}{}{你知道我们只有一对一的打斗吗？[看着试图躲在你身后的路德维希]我看到你，呃，“很亲密”，但你们不会一起去竞技场。}
### {223}{}{You do realize that we have one-on-one fights only? [looks at your company] I won't let your team go with you. Let them stay around.}
{223}{}{你知道我们只有一对一的打斗吗？[看看你的公司]我不会让你的团队和你一起走的。让他们留在身边。}
### {224}{999}{Of course. Be right back.}
{224}{999}{当然马上回来。}
### {225}{999}{One-on-one only? Then I'll think about it some more.}
{225}{999}{一对一？然后我再考虑一下。}

### {1501}{}{[he critically looks at you] Hmm... Okay, as a newbie, you're getting a newbie opponent. Recently, we had one guy from the east coming here - that's who you're gonna be fighting. Don't forget to pay the entrance fee - four hundred.}
{1501}{}{[他严厉地看着你]嗯……好吧，作为一个新手，你会遇到一个新手对手。最近，我们有一个来自东方的家伙来到这里――那就是你要和之战斗的人。别忘了付入场费――四百元。}
### {151}{018}{I'm ready. Shall we start?}
{151}{018}{我准备好了。我们开始吧？}
### {152}{018}{I'm itching to taste his blood!}
{152}{018}{我很想尝尝他的血！}
### {153}{999}{Although, I think I'll pass.}
{153}{999}{尽管如此，我想我会通过的。}
### {1502}{}{Not bad for a start. This time you will fight the ex-bodyguard of our boss. His screws are a little loose, thanks to the Drop. He bulldozes forward like a rabid Chimera, not caring about protection. Keep that in mind. The fee is four hundred, just like the last time.}
{1502}{}{一开始还不错。这次你要和我们老板的前保镖决斗。多亏了Drop，他的螺丝有点松了。他像一个狂热的奇美拉一样奋力向前，不在乎保护。记住这一点。费用是四百，和上次一样。}
### {154}{018}{I've seen worse. I'm ready.}
{154}{018}{我见过更糟糕的情况。我准备好了。}
### {155}{018}{Ha! The only one who has his screws loose is me! I hope you dug up a grave for him...}
{155}{018}{哈唯一松开螺丝的是我！我希望你为他挖一个坟墓。。。}
### {156}{999}{Let's do it some other time. I've got things to do.}
{156}{999}{改天再做吧。我有事情要做。}
### {1503}{}{I have a feeling that it's going to be a spectacular show today. Be warned though - your opponent is not that simple. He is a savage, bad at talking, even worse at thinking, but already put down seven guys. He doesn't mind eating some human flesh after the fight - or so I've heard. Still, if he kills you, I think you wouldn't care... The fee is usual.}
{1503}{}{我有一种感觉，这将是一个壮观的表演今天。不过，请注意，你的对手并不是那么简单。他是个野蛮人，不善言辞，甚至不善思考，但已经放下了七个人。他不介意打架后吃一些人肉――或者我听说过。尽管如此，如果他杀了你，我想你不会在乎。。。费用一般。}
### {157}{018}{It is I who will rip his liver and eat it! Let me at him!}
{157}{018}{是我要把他的肝撕裂吃掉！让我对着他！}
### {158}{018}{I hope you're right about your feeling. Let me warm up a little, and we can start.}
{158}{018}{我希望你的感觉是对的。让我稍微暖和一下，我们就可以开始了。}
### {159}{999}{Uh... No. Not now.}
{159}{999}{嗯不，现在不行。}
### {1504}{}{I have a special one for you. Check this out - I called him from the other side or the Radius! He is a professional fighter, albeit not young. He put down so many people... I had a chance to fight him too. Those were the days... Watch for his right hook and keep distance. I'm not trying to make you piss yourself, just giving you a picture of what you're dealing with.}
{1504}{}{我有一个特别的给你。看看这个-我从另一边或半径打电话给他！他是一名职业拳击手，尽管并不年轻。他放倒了那么多人。。。我也有机会和他决斗。那些日子。。。注意他的右勾拳并保持距离。我不是想让你尿自己，只是给你一张你正在处理的事情的照片。}
### {1510}{018}{Did you warn him too? If he approaches, I'll gouge his eyes out! Yeah! Time to kill!}
{1510}{018}{你也警告过他吗？如果他走近，我就把他的眼睛挖出来！是 啊是时候杀人了！}
### {1511}{018}{I'm in. Let's go.}
{1511}{018}{我在，走吧。}
### {1512}{999}{Wait, I need to prepare.}
{1512}{999}{等等，我需要准备。}
### {1505}{}{[he sighs] That's how it is - Mate expressed his desire to fight you. Don't look at his appearance, the Hog made him his right hand not just for kicks. He is smart and cunning... Honestly, I'm getting no joy from this kind of fight. Mate is my friend, but you, champ, are no stranger to me too. You made me so much money! Yeah... Anyway, give him your best, the crowd is waiting!}
{1505}{}{[他叹了口气]事情就是这样――Mate表达了他想和你战斗的愿望。别看他的外表，猪让他成为自己的右手不仅仅是为了踢球。他既聪明又狡猾。。。老实说，我从这种打斗中没有得到任何乐趣。伴侣是我的朋友，但你，冠军，对我来说也并不陌生。你给我赚了那么多钱！是 啊不管怎样，给他你最好的，人群在等着！}
### {1513}{018}{I hear you. Let's mess his hair a little.}
{1513}{018}{我听到了。让我们把他的头发弄乱一点。}
### {1514}{018}{I can only promise that he dies quickly... And painfully! That's it, I'm going!}
{1514}{018}{我只能保证他会很快死去。。。痛苦！就这样，我要走了！}
### {1515}{999}{I need to prepare for this kind of fight... }
{1515}{999}{我需要为这种战斗做准备。。。}
### {1506}{}{[he makes a long pause] Hog himself became interested in you, champion. I don't know what's going on in his head, but... This is really serious. You've never seen anything like it. Are you aware that he doesn't sleep? Or that he can squash Ursa's skull with his one hand? Try to avoid getting close - if he grabs you, you're going to be broken in half. So, ready?}
{1506}{}{（他停顿了很长时间）霍格自己也对你感兴趣了，冠军。我不知道他脑子里在想什么，但是。。。这真的很严重。你从来没有见过这样的事。你知道他不睡觉吗？或者说他可以用一只手压扁熊的头骨？尽量避免靠近――如果他抓住你，你会被摔成两半。那么，准备好了吗？}
### {1516}{018}{It's time to rip this Hog's fangs! Tell them I'm going!}
{1516}{018}{是时候扯下这只猪的獠牙了！告诉他们我要去！}
### {1517}{018}{I'm ready. Don't worry, we'll make this beautiful.}
{1517}{018}{我准备好了。别担心，我们会让它变得美丽的。}
### {1518}{999}{I need to deal with something. Talk later.}
{1518}{999}{我需要处理一些事情。稍后再谈。}
### {1507}{}{[he sighs with regret] No, champ. There's no one like you, so people are not betting against you... And I can't make a profit in this situation. Sorry.}
{1507}{}{[他遗憾地叹了口气]不，冠军。没有人能像你一样，所以人们不会把赌注押在你身上。。。在这种情况下我无法盈利。很抱歉}
### {1519}{999}{That's how the price of glory looks like... Okay, I had my share of fights.}
{1519}{999}{这就是荣耀的价格。。。好吧，我也打过架。}


### {1601}{}{[he gives you winnings] We are dealing honestly here - take your share, lucky guy. As agreed - }
{1601}{}{[他给你奖金]我们在这里诚实地交易――幸运的家伙，分享你的一份。按约定-}
### {161}{}{ batteries.}
{161}{}{电池。}
### {162}{999}{Ha! The fortune favors strong! Be well.}
{162}{999}{哈幸运眷顾强者！好好的。}
### {1602}{}{[he shrugs in regret] Tough luck, kid. It happens sometimes.}
{1602}{}{[他遗憾地耸耸肩]运气不好，孩子。这种情况有时会发生。}
### {163}{017}{The fight was a set-up! Get me back my batteries, bitch, or I'll carve your name on your bald head!}
{163}{017}{这场打斗是一场阴谋！把我的电池拿回来，婊子，否则我会把你的名字刻在你的光头上！}
### {164}{999}{A fucking rip-off... I'll be back soon.}
{164}{999}{他妈的敲竹杠。。。我很快就会回来。}
### {165}{999}{Yes, it happens. Maybe next time.}
{165}{999}{是的，它确实发生了。也许下次吧。}


### {170}{}{[he stretches his neck] Nice, a chance to remember the glory days on the Arena... Do you know what a "windmill with a back entrance" is? Or "winky molerat"? I'll show you...}
{170}{}{[他伸长脖子]很好，有机会回忆竞技场上的辉煌岁月。。。你知道什么是“有后门的风车”吗？还是“winky molerat”？我给你看。。。}
### {171}{998}{Come at me!}
{171}{998}{来吧！}


### {1801}{}{[he nods, looking satisfied] Pretty good. You have some potential, and the crowd likes you. Here are your winnings.}
{1801}{}{[他点点头，看起来很满意]还不错。你有一定的潜力，观众喜欢你。这是您赢得的奖金。}
### {181}{999}{Thank you very much. Later!}
{181}{999}{非常感谢。后来}
### {1802}{}{[he pats you on the shoulder] Good job, kid! As you broke his jaw, I understood right away that it was a good idea to bet on you! Keep it up! And don't forget your winnings.}
{1802}{}{[他拍了拍你的肩膀]干得好，孩子！当你打断了他的下巴时，我立刻明白了把赌注押在你身上是个好主意！继续加油！别忘了你的奖金。}
### {182}{999}{Yes, it was a good warm-up. Now I can get some rest.}
{182}{999}{是的，这是一次很好的热身。现在我可以休息了。}
### {1803}{}{You are just like me in my best years! Went so hard on that asshole, now I have to clean the Arena for a whole day after you... I need to think really hard about who to put you against next time. For now - here, you earned it.}
{1803}{}{你就像我最好的时候一样！对那个混蛋如此严厉，现在我必须在你之后打扫竞技场一整天。。。我需要认真考虑下一次该和谁对抗。就目前而言，这是你应得的。}
### {183}{999}{Notice that I won't count it! Okay, see you.}
{183}{999}{注意，我不会数的！好的，再见。}
### {1804}{}{My champion! If you only knew how much money I made on you... I'm going to fuck every girl in a brothel - and then drink every bottle of Apothecary's booze! This was a hell of a fight! Where did you learn that tricks? Teach me, when you'll get the chance. Here's your cut... And a little extra, from me.}
{1804}{}{我的冠军！如果你知道我在你身上赚了多少钱。。。我要操妓院里的每一个女孩，然后喝下每一瓶药剂师的酒！这是一场地狱般的战斗！你在哪里学的那些把戏？教我，什么时候你会有机会。这是你的伤口。。。还有一点额外的，来自我。}
### {184}{999}{Blood money... Nice. Until next time.}
{184}{999}{血腥钱美好的直到下次。}
### {1805}{}{[he silently watches Mate's body, leaving a blood trail, being dragged off the Arena] Oh, Mate, my Mate... Anyway, that was his choice. And you? You did a clean job, as always. Here, champ.}
{1805}{}{[他默默地看着Mate的尸体，留下血痕，被拖下竞技场]哦，Mate，我的Mate。。。不管怎样，那是他的选择。你呢？你一如既往地干干净净。来，冠军。}
### {185}{999}{Don't feel bad. Better him than we.}
{185}{999}{别难过。他比我们好。}
### {1806}{}{[he gazes at the Arena, unable to say any word] Fuck me sideways by a ghoul... It's worth living to see a fight like this! It's like the next Great War! There was a Hog - and now it's just a puddle of blood with a pile of meat... Here, this is yours. [he starts counting the batteries, but suddenly gives you everything he holds] You know, take it all! Holy shit... What's going to happen now?}
{1806}{}{[他凝视着竞技场，一句话也说不出来]被一个食尸鬼从侧面操我。。。看到这样的打斗是值得活着的！这就像是下一次大战！曾经有一只猪，现在它只是一滩血和一堆肉。。。给，这是你的。[他开始数电池，但突然把他所有的东西都给了你]你知道，全部拿走！我的天呐现在会发生什么？}
### {186}{999}{You'll see. Wait here, I'm going to have a talk with you very soon.}
{186}{999}{你会看到的。在这里等一下，我很快就要和你谈谈。}


### {190}{}{[he puts his hands up, laughing] No, boss! I don't want to become a cripple for the rest of my days.}
{190}{}{[他举起双手大笑]不，老板！我不想在剩下的日子里成为一个跛子。}
### {191}{020}{Okay then, relax. Better tell me - how's the situation around here?}
{191}{020}{好吧，放松。最好告诉我这里的情况如何？}
### {192}{021}{Will you enlighten me about local business then?}
{192}{021}{那你能告诉我当地的生意吗？}
### {193}{999}{Take care of yourself, big guy. See you around.}
{193}{999}{照顾好自己，大个子。回头见。}


### {2001}{}{[he shows his clenched fist] Like this! I'm holding the situation tightly under my control, boss! The fighters are coming to me themselves, and since you put Hog down, Arena is always full with the crowd. The place is famous now! Maybe I should put a memorial sign.}
{2001}{}{[他露出紧握的拳头]像这样！老板，我正在控制局势！战士们自己也来找我，自从你放倒霍格之后，竞技场总是挤满了观众。这个地方现在很有名！也许我应该挂个纪念牌。}
### {201}{021}{A good idea, by the way... So, this means that our finances are good?}
{201}{021}{顺便说一句，这是个好主意。。。那么，这意味着我们的财务状况良好？}
### {202}{999}{Glad to hear. Keep them on their toes, bud. And I need to go.}
{202}{999}{很高兴听到。让他们保持警觉，伙计。我得走了。}
### {2002}{}{[he shrugs his strong shoulders] More or less. Like before, I'd say. We won't find anyone like Hog, that's for sure, but the Arena is still providing a steady income. }
{2002}{}{[他耸耸结实的肩膀]或多或少。就像以前一样，我想说。我们肯定找不到像霍格这样的人，但竞技场仍然提供稳定的收入。}
### {203}{021}{Elaborate on that, be so kind - what about the profits?}
{203}{021}{详细说明一下，请友善一点――利润如何？}
### {204}{999}{Good. Well, I need to go.}
{204}{999}{好的好吧，我得走了。}
### {2003}{}{[he shakes his head, like stunned Ursa] Everything is shit, kid. Soon the Rainbow will become a memory of itself, especially with this fucking anarchy around. We're in dire need of a leader, someone with metal balls... Man... Only the Arena keeps me from getting drunk all the time.}
{2003}{}{[他摇摇头，像是目瞪口呆的乌尔萨]一切都是垃圾，孩子。彩虹很快就会成为自己的记忆，尤其是在这种该死的无政府状态下。我们急需一个领袖，一个有金属球的人。。。伙计…只有竞技场能让我一直不喝醉。}
### {205}{999}{This is something to think about... I won't be distracting you anymore.}
{205}{999}{这是一件值得思考的事情。。。我不会再分散你的注意力了。}


### {2101}{}{[with a happy look, he weighs a little black bag in his hand] All here, boss! It's so much, my biceps are getting tired to hold it! }
{2101}{}{[他高兴地看了看，手里拿着一个黑色的小袋子]都来了，老板！太多了，我的二头肌都累了！}
### {211}{999}{Great! Give it to me. Good job, tough guy!}
{211}{999}{太棒了给我。干得好，硬汉！}
### {2102}{}{[he bites a tip of his mustache] Steadily, boss. It's going to be a lot of money, just wait for the payday. As usual, come 5-th and 20-th.}
{2102}{}{[他咬了一口小胡子]稳扎稳打，老板。这将是一大笔钱，只是等待发薪日。像往常一样，来第5和第20次。}
### {212}{999}{Glad to hear. See you soon.}
{212}{999}{很高兴听到。再见。}
### {2103}{}{[he throws you a bag of batteries] All there is. It's not going to be more than that.}
{2103}{}{[他扔给你一袋电池]就这样。不会超过这个的。}
### {213}{999}{Money is money. See you around.}
{213}{999}{钱就是钱。回头见。}
### {2104}{}{[he yawns, showing his metal teeth] There's something... Come by at 5-th or 20-th - we'll see what we have.}
{2104}{}{[他打了个哈欠，露出金属牙]有什么。。。5号或20号过来，我们看看有什么。}
### {214}{999}{Right. And I need to go now. See you.}
{214}{999}{正确的我现在需要走了。再见}
