#{100}{}{You see: Supervisor}
{100}{}{你看：主管}
#{101}{}{You see the Vault City maintenance supervisor.}
{101}{}{你去见保险库城市维护主管。}
#{102}{}{What did Joshua screw up this time?}
{102}{}{乔舒亚这次搞砸了什么？}
#{103}{}{Citizen? Please don't distract Joshua, he's on a tight schedule.}
{103}{}{公民？请不要分散约书亚的注意力，他日程很紧。}
#{104}{}{What have I done...}
{104}{}{我做了什么...}
#{105}{}{Don't try that again!}
{105}{}{别再试了！}
#{106}{}{*error executing script*}
{106}{}{*执行脚本时出错*}
#{110}{}{Hello, }
{110}{}{你好，}
#{111}{}{. Did you want something?}
{111}{}{. 你想要什么吗？}
#{112}{}{What can you tell me about Joshua?}
{112}{}{关于约书亚你能告诉我什么？}
#{113}{}{Did you know Joshua lost one of the scouting robots?}
{113}{}{你知道约书亚失去了一个侦察机器人吗？}
#{114}{}{Could you let me use your computer?}
{114}{}{你能让我用一下你的电脑吗？}
#{115}{}{Tell me about your department.}
{115}{}{告诉我你所在部门的情况。}
#{116}{}{I got this piece of information from the nearby nuclear power plant. What can you tell me about it?}
{116}{}{我从附近的核电站得到这条消息。你能告诉我些什么吗？}
#{117}{}{Don't worry.}
{117}{}{别担心。}
#{120}{}{Absolutely. We maintain all of the city's technology, from simple lights to computers, terminals, and robots.}
{120}{}{当然。我们维护着这个城市的所有技术，从简单的灯光到计算机、终端和机器人。}
#{121}{}{I fixed that light your man was having trouble with.}
{121}{}{我修好了你手下的灯。}
#{122}{}{Oh, uh... Yeah, I heard. It's hard to find experienced workers these days, you know? Well, anyway, thanks for the help, }
{122}{}{哦，呃...是的，我听说了。现在很难找到有经验的工人，你知道吗？不管怎样，谢谢你的帮助，}
#{123}{}{.}
{123}{}{.}
#{124}{}{Absolutely not! The information on our servers can be dangerous to common citizens! The Overseer declared it classified. Try logging a request with the Information Bureau and they'll decide what you can and can't see.}
{124}{}{绝对不是！我们服务器上的信息对普通公民来说是危险的！监工宣布它是机密的。试着向信息局记录一个请求，他们会决定你能看到什么，不能看到什么。}
#{125}{}{That's enough.}
{125}{}{够了。}
#{126}{}{*Another* one? No, I don't think so. If he did, he'd tell me.}
{126}{}{*又一个？不，我不这么认为。如果他有，他会告诉我的。}
#{127}{}{Here's the holodisk from the missing robot. Believe me now?}
{127}{}{这是失踪机器人的全息光盘。相信我吧？}
#{128}{}{[Sigh] I feel bad for him, I really do. He has a lot on his plate. But he's already lost two robots, and that puts him on thin ice. We need these robots to work in hazardous zones, and they're not easy to replace. Joshua's received a number of warnings already. If he can't be trusted, he must be isolated.}
{128}{}{我为他感到难过，真的。他有很多事要做。但他已经失去了两个机器人，这使他如履薄冰。我们需要这些机器人在危险区域工作，而且它们不容易更换。约书亚已经收到了很多警告。如果他不能被信任，他必须被孤立。}
#{129}{}{That's a little harsh, don't you think?}
{129}{}{这有点苛刻，你不觉得吗？}
#{130}{}{No, I don't. Rules are rules. If we can't uphold the laws written by the committee and the Overseer, then there will be chaos in the city.}
{130}{}{不，我没有。规则就是规则。如果我们不能坚持委员会和督察制定的法律，那么城市就会混乱。}
#{131}{}{Joshua lied to me? That's it, no more kid gloves. I'll have the committee place Joshua in correctional isolation.}
{131}{}{约书亚骗了我？就这样，别再戴小手套了。我会让委员会把约书亚关起来。}
#{132}{}{That's right! He deserves no less!}
{132}{}{这是正确的！他活该！}
#{133}{}{Well, if you say so.}
{133}{}{好吧，如果你这么说的话。}
#{134}{}{Thank you for telling me this, }
{134}{}{谢谢你告诉我这个，}
#{135}{}{! You did the right thing, exposing this vermin! Keep it up. Oh, and long live Vault City!}
{135}{}{! 你做得对，暴露了这个害虫！坚持下去。哦，避难所城万岁！}
#{136}{}{Of course.}
{136}{}{当然。}
#{140}{}{Hmm, interesting. It looks like a list of nearby radio stations and their broadcasting parameters. We probably won't be able to listen to them, though.}
{140}{}{嗯，很有趣。它看起来像是附近电台及其广播参数的列表。不过，我们可能听不进去。}
#{141}{}{Where are those stations located?}
{141}{}{那些车站在哪里？}
#{142}{}{Uh... I'm afraid that's classified...}
{142}{}{Uh...恐怕这是机密...}
#{143}{}{Then there's no way in hell you're getting this then!}
{143}{}{那你就不可能得到这个！}
#{144}{}{What?! You wouldn't... If I tell the Overseer how the wastes have changed you...}
{144}{}{什么？！你不会...如果我告诉监工废物是如何改变你的...}
#{145}{}{What? It's just a simple request. But... I think I'll let you be, just in case.}
{145}{}{什么？这只是一个简单的要求。但是...我想我会让你去的，以防万一。}
#{146}{}{...then I'll tell him how you drove Joshua insane. How does that sound?}
{146}{}{……那我就告诉他你是怎么把约书亚逼疯的。听起来怎么样？}
#{147}{}{Too bad. I think I'll go.}
{147}{}{太糟糕了。我想我要走了。}
#{148}{}{I never thought I'd hear that from one of our own citizens. Is this really what the wastes do to a man? Fine, I won't argue, if you're capable of *that*.}
{148}{}{我从没想过我会从我们的公民那里听到这些。这真的是废物对人的影响吗？好吧，我不会争辩的，如果你能做到的话。}
#{149}{}{Perfect. We'll go our separate ways, then.}
{149}{}{很 完美。那我们各奔东西吧。}
#{150}{}{I cross-compared the information with our own data. It looks like only two of these locations are somewhere nearby. One is the nuclear power plant to the north, and the other is a few days to the south-east. Here, I'll mark it on your map.}
{150}{}{我把这些信息和我们自己的数据进行了交叉比较。看起来只有两个地点在附近。一个是北面的核电站，另一个是东南面的几天。给，我在你的地图上标出。}
#{151}{}{You have learned of a new location in the south-east}
{151}{}{你听说东南部有个新地方}
#{152}{}{Hey, this is Cheyenne's territory! That's interesting...}
{152}{}{嘿，这是夏延的地盘！真有趣...}
#{153}{}{That will keep me busy, at least...}
{153}{}{那会让我很忙，至少...}
#{160}{}{Can you help fix this onboard computer?}
{160}{}{你能帮我修一下这台机载电脑吗？}
#{161}{}{I can't do that for you while your citizenship is suspended. I'll need authorization from Peter Graves. If he gives the okay, I'll do my best to help you.}
{161}{}{你的公民身份被吊销了，我不能帮你这么做。我需要彼得・格雷夫斯的授权。如果他同意，我会尽力帮助你。}
#{162}{}{Understood.}
{162}{}{理解。}
#{163}{}{Sure thing. Sergeant Graves gave the okay. Let me take a look at it.}
{163}{}{当然。格雷夫斯中士同意了。让我看看。}
#{164}{}{Here you go.}
{164}{}{干得好。}
#{165}{}{Actually, I'll try and fix it myself.}
{165}{}{实际上，我会自己去修的。}
#{166}{}{You found a simple way to fix the train.}
{166}{}{你找到了一个简单的方法来修理火车。}
#{200}{}{Joshua! Get over here!}
{200}{}{约书亚！过来！}
#{201}{}{You bastard! You ratted me out!}
{201}{}{你这个混蛋！你出卖了我！}
#{202}{}{Too late.}
{202}{}{太晚了。}
#{203}{}{To hell with this! You won't get me!}
{203}{}{去他妈的！你抓不到我！}
#{204}{}{Josh! Stop!!!}
{204}{}{乔希！停下！！！}
#{205}{}{Halt, citizen!}
{205}{}{站住，市民！}
#{206}{}{Get back here, citizen!}
{206}{}{回来，市民！}
#{207}{}{Joshua has fled the city in depression. You're pretty sure you won't be seeing him again.}
{207}{}{约书亚在大萧条中逃离了这个城市。你肯定再也见不到他了。}
#{1103}{}{Citizen? Please don't distract Joshua, he's on a tight schedule.}
{1103}{}{公民？请不要分散约书亚的注意力，他日程很紧。}
#{1121}{}{I fixed that light your man was having trouble with.}
{1121}{}{我修好了你手下的灯。}
#{1134}{}{Thank you for telling me this, citizen.}
{1134}{}{谢谢你告诉我，市民。}
#{1148}{}{I never thought I'd hear that from one of our own citizens. Is this really what the wastes do to a woman? Fine, I won't argue, if you're capable of *that*.}
{1148}{}{我从没想过我会从我们的公民那里听到这些。这真的是废物对女人的影响吗？好吧，我不会争辩的，如果你能做到的话。}
#{1201}{}{You bitch! You ratted me out!}
{1201}{}{你这个婊子！你出卖了我！}
