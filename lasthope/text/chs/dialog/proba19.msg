I tried to do it myself, but there are too many of them. I'll pay you $300 for the job. You want it?}
{107}{}{你好，陌生人，我看到你和迈克在说话。他告诉你我提供的工作了吗？[你点头。]所以你知道矿井的情况。必须清除掉那些老鼠。。。我试着自己做，但他们太多了。我付给你300美元做这份工作。你想要吗？}

### {121}{}{There are some issues I was asked to discuss with you.}
{121}{}{有一些问题我被要求和你讨论。}
### {122}{}{Just looking around.}
{122}{}{只是环顾四周。}

{123}{}{好的，请坐下。[他做手势。]好吧，告诉我吧。。。}
### {124}{}{Well... I've just come from Farmers Town, they are very interested to start trading again. As soon as possible, they want peace.}
{124}{}{好我刚从农民镇来，他们对重新开始交易很感兴趣。他们希望尽快实现和平。}
### {125}{}{Right, but I don't know what it has to do with me. I own the mine, and yes, Miners and Farmers had peace once. You know, business was going well... But that story, it just didn't last... They didn't pay us for the coal, our losses were increasing and there was no money coming in... Eventually, we had to end the deal and shut down the mine.}
{125}{}{是的，但我不知道这和我有什么关系。我拥有这个矿，是的，矿工和农民曾经有过和平。你知道，生意进展顺利。。。但那个故事，只是没有持续。。。他们没有支付我们的煤炭费用，我们的损失越来越大，也没有钱流入……最终，我们不得不终止交易，关闭了矿场。}
### {126}{}{I assure you they are willing to make a compromise. Tell me your terms and I'll go tell them. You have nothing to lose, they were very interested in reviving that contract.}
{126}{}{我向你保证，他们愿意作出妥协。告诉我你的条件，我就去告诉他们。你没有什么可失去的，他们对恢复合同很感兴趣。}
### {127}{}{Alright then. If they want business again they must pay me $3000 every month with no delay. Otherwise I'm gonna tell the sheriff about it, and there will be trouble again. Got that? Then go and tell them.}
{127}{}{好吧。如果他们想再做生意，他们必须每月毫不拖延地付给我3000美元。否则我会把这件事告诉警长，然后会再次发生麻烦。明白了吗？然后去告诉他们。}
### {128}{}{I'm on it.}
{128}{}{我在上面。}
### {129}{}{I'll come back when I have something better. }
{129}{}{当我有更好的东西时，我会回来的。}
### {130}{}{Have you told Farmers Town my terms?}

{133}{}{我告诉他们你的条件，他们同意付款，这是第一笔付款。[递给他3000美元。]}
### {134}{}{Still working on it.}
{134}{}{还在努力。}
### {135}{}{Very well, I'm glad they've started thinking straight again. Yet again, you've shown me that you are worth something. I've got this metal armor, please, take it as a token of my appreciation. Good luck with your travels.}
{135}{}{很好，我很高兴他们又开始思考了。再一次，你向我展示了你的价值。我有这件金属盔甲，请把它当作我的感谢。祝你旅途愉快。}
### {136}{}{So long.}
{136}{}{再见。}
### {137}{}{It doesn't matter. I have a very good deal with the south, so I don't need them. I'm going to tell the sheriff about this new situation. So, you can tell your friends to stay away for their own good. Only bullets for them here. As for you, I guess $1000 should be enough... Go now, I have to get back to my work.}
{137}{}{没关系。我和南方有很好的交易，所以我不需要他们。我要把这个新情况告诉警长。所以，为了自己的利益，你可以告诉你的朋友远离。这里只有子弹给他们。至于你，我想1000美元应该足够了。。。走吧，我得回去工作了。}
### {138}{}{I'll be going then.}
{138}{}{那我就去。}
### {139}{}{Good job. Keep it that way.}
{139}{}{干得好保持这种状态。}
### {140}{}{Nice to see you again.}

### {143}{}{I don't want to talk.}
{143}{}{我不想说话。}
### {144}{}{Leave me to my work!}
{144}{}{让我去工作吧！}
### {145}{}{Well, what about that first payment? I haven't seen anything, yet.}
{145}{}{那么，第一笔付款怎么样？我什么也没看到。}
### {146}{}{I'll come back with the money.}
{146}{}{我会带着钱回来的。}
### {147}{}{I want $500 for the job.}
{147}{}{这份工作我要500美元。}
### {148}{}{No, that's too much for me. How do you think I'm going to pay the workers? I only got $300 and that's it. If I were you, I would accept the offer... If you don't need money just walk away and I'll find someone who does.}
{148}{}{不，那对我来说太多了。你认为我该怎么支付工人的工资？我只拿到300美元，就这样。如果我是你，我会接受这个报价。。。如果你不需要钱，就走开，我会找到一个需要钱的人。}
### {149}{}{Right, I'll be back when the job is done.}
{149}{}{好的，工作完成后我会回来的。}
### {150}{}{Do it yourself, I'm out of here.}
{150}{}{你自己做吧，我离开这里。}
### {151}{}{Can't you pay me $500? It would cover the extra expenses to make sure your mine is safe for the workers.}
{151}{}{你能付我500美元吗？它将支付额外的费用，以确保您的矿山对工人来说是安全的。}
### {152}{}{I don't think it's at all necessary, but if it helps to do a proper job... Why not? You'll get your $500.}
{152}{}{我认为这根本没有必要，但如果这有助于做好工作。。。为什么不呢？你会得到你的500美元。}
### {153}{}{That's all I need to know. I'll be back.}
{153}{}{这就是我需要知道的全部。我会回来的。}
### {154}{}{Let me think about it, I'll get back to you.}
{154}{}{让我考虑一下，我会给你回复的。}
### {155}{}{What happened then?}
{155}{}{当时发生了什么？}
### {156}{}{Since then, we stopped trading with them... Years have passed. But recently, with your help I reopened the mine because I got a good deal with the south. Having in mind our previous business situation with Farmers Town, I don't think I want to remake that contract, they can't be trusted.}
{156}{}{从那以后，我们停止了与他们的交易。。。多年过去了。但最近，在你的帮助下，我重新开放了矿山，因为我与南方有很好的交易。考虑到我们之前与Farmers Town的业务情况，我认为我不想重新签订合同，他们是不可信任的。}
### {157}{}{Not so fast, the sheriff doesn't need to know about this. Because you're not going to tell him, right?}
{157}{}{没那么快，警长不需要知道这件事。因为你不会告诉他，对吧？}
### {158}{}{If you say so, let me just... close the door...}
{158}{}{如果你这么说，让我。。。关上门。。。}
### {159}{}{Don't worry, I can do that, after I'm done here.}
{159}{}{别担心，我在这里结束后，我可以做到。}
### {160}{}{Can't you reconsider your decision?}
{160}{}{你不能重新考虑你的决定吗？}
### {161}{}{Hmm, reconsider, you say? [He pulls out a gun.] Let me think...}
{161}{}{嗯，重新考虑一下，你说？[他拔出一把枪。]让我想想。。。}
### {162}{}{I guess we can think faster now.}
{162}{}{我想我们现在可以更快地思考了。}
### {163}{}{That's nice to hear but... aren't you forgetting something? You told me you were going to take care of it... that situation in the mine?}
{163}{}{很高兴听到，但是。。。你不是忘了什么吗？你告诉我你会处理好的…矿井里的情况？}
### {164}{}{Oh, sorry, I'm on it.}
{164}{}{哦，对不起，我在上面。}
### {165}{}{Find someone else to do your work.}
{165}{}{找其他人来做你的工作。}
### {166}{}{That's nice to hear but... lets talk about the mine situation first, any news?}
{166}{}{很高兴听到，但是。。。我们先谈谈矿井的情况，有什么消息吗？}
### {167}{}{Hello there stranger. What can Murphy do for you?}
{167}{}{你好，陌生人。墨菲能为你做些什么？}
### {168}{}{Those matters will have to wait because we have a serious situation down in the mine. Please don't bother me right now.}
{168}{}{这些事情将不得不等待，因为我们矿井里的情况很严重。请现在不要打扰我。}
### {169}{}{Nevermind that, we have a difficult situation in the mine. It has to be cleaned from those damn rats... I tried to do it myself, but there are too many of them. I'll pay you $300 for the job. You want it?}
{169}{}{尽管如此，我们矿井的情况还是很困难。必须清除那些该死的老鼠。。。我试着自己做，但他们太多了。我付给你300美元做这份工作。你想要吗？}
### {170}{}{Thanks, can we talk about Farmers now?}
{170}{}{谢谢，我们现在可以谈谈农民吗？}
### {171}{}{I wanted to discuss business again.}
{171}{}{我想再谈一次生意。}
