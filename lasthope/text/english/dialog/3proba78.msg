{100}{}{Hey, who the hell are you and how did you get in!?}
{101}{}{Um... Your man at the front door let me in.}
{102}{}{Well, the door was open...}
{103}{}{Sorry, wrong house.}
#man let dude in...
{104}{}{But, why didn't he told me about you. First I hear some strange noises and then I see you? Something is very
 wrong here... Guards!}
{105}{}{I'm sorry, but nobody will hear you now.}
#door was open...
{106}{}{Strange, I told my man to lock the door... I do not recall us being introduced... Guards!}
{107}{}{They can't help you now.}
#conspiracy...
{108}{}{My man told me you have some information. If you've got something solid, introduce yourself and speak
 plainly, otherwise don't waste my time.}
{109}{}{I've heard that someone is planning your assassination.}
{110}{}{As I said, your life is in danger. I can prove it.}
#
{111}{}{[Laughs.] Hah... Old news. Ever since I took this job there were those who want my "early retirement", if you
 know what I mean. They couldn't stand the fact that I did more to help this city than they managed to fill in their
 pockets. Even in the past those so-called patriots tried to corrupt the government by using their influence which would
 have ensured their political existence...}
{112}{}{Go on...}
#
{113}{}{...but I saw it coming. So before they could even play with their lucky cards I disbanded the government and
 took control over the city. That was the only way to preserve what we had before the war. And let's face it, it's
 easier to replace one man if found corrupt then the whole bunch of them. So you see, there are reasons why they
 desperately want me gone. I'm not going to give up, though, it's my duty.}
{114}{}{And you should make a stand. What do you plan to do?}
#
{115}{}{On the contrary, stay low for a while, observe from the background. They are desperate but vulnerable at the
 same time. They have enemies who also found this situation potentially useful. By helping the enemy of our enemy, we
 could in theory, "eliminate" one problem.}
{116}{}{Do you know for sure who you are exactly fighting against? What if there is a greater threat?}
{117}{}{Are you sure about that plan. What if they use your help against you?}
#greater threat...
{118}{}{I'm not worried, I have people working on it, gathering information. Tell me, are you interested in a job?}
{119}{}{I guess I can make myself useful. What am I supposed to do?}
{120}{}{I'll come back later.}
#supposed to do...
{121}{}{Same as the others, investigate all possible threats. Try to dig out any internal information about them and
 their enemies. I must know WHO and WHEN "they" are going to make a move...}
{122}{}{I'm listening...}
#
{123}{}{This won't be easy. It will include a lot of "risky" situations but I assure you, if you contribute enough
 for this "situation" to be resolved in our favor, besides generously rewarding you, I will make certain concessions
 for you. I expect your answer soon, but don't make me wait for too long or someone else will take your place.}
{124}{}{I'm ready to start right now.}
{125}{}{Sure thing Mr. Donson. I'll be back.}
#ready.
{126}{}{Good. Time is running against us. You know what to do, so get to it. }
{127}{}{Yes, sir.}
#
{128}{}{You're back. Are you going to take the job?}
{129}{}{I'm ready to start right now.}
{130}{}{Not just yet.}
#
{131}{}{You are back stranger, wanna hear about that job I'm offering?}
{132}{}{Alright Mr. Donson, you got my attention.}
#
{133}{}{Do you have any information that might be of interest to me?}
#possible answers to question line 133:
{134}{}{Nothing yet Mr. Donson.}
{135}{}{I'm suspecting some slavers on the west side of town.}
{136}{}{I'm very much convinced that Sebastian's gang is a problem.}
{137}{}{Samuel's organization could be a possible threat.}
#Slavers...
{138}{}{Slavers you say... I'm not so sure about that. They never showed the slightest interest in city policies, not to
 mention they pay me money for the stuff I get for them. You see, they have a good business running and they stay out
 of my way. It's not wise to ignore an important source of income to the city.}
{139}{}{Well, back to the start then.}
#Samuel...
{140}{}{They might, but you forgot something, THEY are a trading company not a group of assassins. That makes no
 sense, does it? You need better proof, and if you don't have it, you are searching in the wrong place, mister.}
{141}{}{Uh, yes, sir.}
#Sebastian...
{142}{}{Nope, you're wrong about it. Although their organization is involved in some activities unknown to me, they
 could not represent a threat. Simply because they take part in daily patrols around the city, fighting raiders and partly
 helping these people.}
{143}{}{I guess I'll be looking somewhere else then.}
#answer to 133 = the real threat
{144}{}{There's a group called "Mad Scorpions" who is secretly spreading the word about joining a greater cause.}
#
{145}{}{What is this madness, where did you hear that?}
{146}{}{From the locals... They are worried about this group, while some are too scared to talk about it.}
#
{147}{}{I must admit, I've never heard about them... But if the lives of my people are at stake, you have my permission
 to do whatever is necessary to prevent bloodshed of the innocent.}
{148}{}{Alright Mr. Donson. I'll do what I must.}
#
{149}{}{So, are you gonna tell me the news?}
{150}{}{I don't have any yet.}
{151}{}{Yes of course. That group, the "Mad Scorpions", their menace is over.}
#
{152}{}{You did it! Excellent work, stranger. You have proven your worth and commitment to this town. I must watch
 out for those mysterious groups in the future. All the city thanks you for this.}
{153}{}{And... about my reward?}
{154}{}{I was glad to help Mr. Donson.}
#
{155}{}{Haha... Of course, I almost forgot. I give you $3000 bucks for your services and you have earned yourself a
 little bonus of $1000. Now, that sounds like charity. [Laughs.]}
{156}{}{I don't know but I like it. Thank you Mr. Donson.}
#
{157}{}{Hello, what can Mr. Donson do for you?}
{158}{}{Got any job for me?}
{159}{}{How are things going in town?}
{160}{}{Nothing, I'll be going then.}
#job...
{161}{}{No, nothing at the time. Come back tomorrow, I have to finish some work first.}
{162}{}{All right, let me ask you something else.}
{163}{}{Sure thing Mr. Donson.}
#things going in town...
{164}{}{Pretty good for a town of this size. Perhaps too good to be true. I just hope they stay that way. If you come
 across any trouble, I'd like to be informed at once.}
{165}{}{Sure thing Mr. Donson.}
#
{166}{}{Of course, what's on your mind, sir?}
#
{167}{}{Yeah, like I said. [He shuffles some papers.] Alright, since I got a few spare minutes... I need some circuit
 boards for Owen. He's repairing some of the old machines in the factory, but he can't make any progress without those
 parts. Get me five of those so my workers can finish their repairs on schedule.}
{168}{}{I'm on it.}
#boards job...
{169}{}{I'm not rushing you, so pull yourself together and bring me five circuit boards, alright?}
{170}{}{Sure thing Mr. Donson.}
#
{171}{}{Well, I see you got those parts I need. Let me see... They look good enough. I'll send them right away to my
 technicians. Here's some money to cover your expenses. Now if you excuse me, it's time to get back to business,
 I suggest you do the same.}
{172}{}{Of course, see you later Mr. Donson.}
#
{173}{}{No, nothing at the moment. Come back some other time.}
#new job...
{174}{}{Yes, there's something you can help me with. Recently, two dead bodies were found near the old council
 building... They were later identified as our citizens. While some believe they were involved in drug business, others
 think they were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time...}
{175}{}{So, what am I supposed to do?}
#
{176}{}{Although my position gives me more power and influence, it does not give me the right to accuse or blame
 anyone suspicious, without further investigation. That's what my predecessors used to do, blindly pointing at each other
 and anyone who thought differently. We are going to do just the opposite here. That means I'm authorizing you to
 conduct a thorough investigation. Bring me the facts, nothing less. We must rely on your objectivity and ability to
 assess the situation. Good luck out there.}
{177}{}{Sure thing, Mr. Donson.}
#
{178}{}{How is your investigation going, any progress?}
{179}{}{Still nothing, sir.}
#
{180}{}{I was informed about your success, good work. This case only serves as a reminder that human nature has
 always been oriented towards destruction, but I'm surprised to what extent it reaches. Furthermore, when in
 correlation with illegal substances, situations get out of control pretty quickly. Sadly, too often with a deadly outcome.
 Nevertheless, I'm glad this situation has been resolved before more lives could be in danger. Here, you earned $5000.
 Now, if you excuse me...}
{181}{}{Thanks. See you around, Mr. Donson.}
#
{182}{}{No, nothing at the moment. Come back some other time.}
#
{183}{}{About that job...}
#new job 2...
{184}{}{There is something, disturbing, at least! One of the locals came across freshly dug up graves on the cemetery,
 outside the city gate. On closer examination, the graves were found to be completely empty, no remains at all. Also, we
 couldn't find any tracks leading off the graveyard so the bodies were probably carried away. And there's more...}
{185}{}{More?}
#Eddie dead, alt see 257
{186}{}{It's odd, when we checked the records, the people buried in those graves died at most two weeks ago. So this
 doesn't look like a random act, but, well, I mean... who steals dead bodies for God's sake!? [Sighs.] I can't even imagine
 why someone would do such an awful thing. We have got a major task in front of us. [Takes a deep breath.] Since my
 assistant Eddie is gone, god knows where, I have to ask for your help. I will give you $2000 for your trouble,
 interested?}
{187}{}{Sure, so what's the plan?}
{188}{}{Not right now, see you later Mr. Donson.}
#back, job not taken...
{189}{}{Like I said, help me find those who took the bodies and their belongings. The people of this city want justice
 and that is exactly what awaits these scavengers. If you help us, I'll give you $2000 for your efforts.}
{190}{}{Alright, what's the plan?}
{191}{}{Not right now, I'll be back.}
#plan...
{192}{}{Well... the situation was bad already and now all this on top of our problem list. Nevertheless, I found out
 that one of the misfits living outside the city was helping them. He has found himself unwillingly in a position to help
 us because he screwed up something and now these scums want him to pay with his own life. I suggest you find that
 man immediately, before he goes missing too. He could be our only chance to solve this one...}
{193}{}{Where can I find this person?}
#
{194}{}{My source told me he was a regular customer at a local bar in the city's slums outside the gate. So you might
 want to start your search there. He goes by the name of Paul. And one more thing... Since the desecration took place
 somewhere around midnight I thought it would be a good idea to wait until dusk and stop by the cemetery, see if we
 overlooked anything. I'd advise you to have some firepower for your protection. [Takes a rifle from his locker.] Here,
 take this rifle and be on you way. Good luck.}
{195}{}{Thanks Mr. Donson, I'm off then.}
#mission progress... thieves killed.
{196}{}{Our source gave me useful information and I managed to ambush the thieves while they were taking away
 some coffins... I barely made it, but I'm sure of one thing, they won't cause anymore trouble.}
#
{197}{}{[Surprised.] Let me congratulate you on a job well done. [Shakes your hand.] Now, here's $2000 for you and
 you can keep the rifle, think of it as a gift or good luck charm. [Smiles.] I hope that anyone else who thinks he can
 come here and cause trouble in my town without consequences, will at least think twice. I must continue my work now,
 thanks again and see you later.}
{198}{}{Sure thing, Mr. Donson.}
#
{199}{}{Have you managed to do something about those stolen bodies?}
#
{200}{}{I was told that some dangerous criminals escaped from the prison up north... Do you have any information about that?}
#
{201}{}{Nothing new, I've been in contact with the prison administrator... And personally I don't like this situation.
 He claims we aren't capable of running our own city, but now it would feel good to say: "Who are they to tell us how to
 run our fine city when they can't carry out the simple task of keeping a few people in one place!?" But...}
{202}{}{But?}
#
{203}{}{The fact is they gave us full support during the transition period when we had to disband our corrupt
 government. But ever since then I've had the feeling they had some kind of agreement with the previous authorities.}
{204}{}{What kind of support did you receive during the transition period?}
{205}{}{How did the government become corrupted?}
{206}{}{Agreement... of what kind?}
{207}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{208}{}{I'll have to go now, thanks for your time Mr. Donson.}
#support...
{209}{}{They were few in numbers but they had weapons and technology to offer. We should have been smarter since
 we used those resources against our own people. We won eventually, but the damage was already done and it
 weren't the weapons which had ended the conflict... It was the common sense of the people who fought it.}
{210}{}{So, how did you end the conflict?}
{211}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{212}{}{Well, there's nothing more I need to know. See you later Mr. Donson.}
#conflict ended up...
{213}{}{After days of gun fights on the streets, many people were dying on both sides, but at the same time we
 managed to take over the government building. The resistance was still strong but we saw there was no point to
 continue the destruction of our city. So I called for a meeting with the former government members...}
{214}{}{What happened then?}
#
{215}{}{I came up with the only reasonable solution at the time, to have them exiled. They just weren't prepared to
 accept the fact they had lost the support of the majority and were using their power to ensure their political existence at
 all costs. As for the people, they came to their senses when we summarized the whole thing from the very beginning.}
{216}{}{Thanks for the story, can I ask you something else?}
{217}{}{I'm glad you've made some progress in this town. Thanks for your time Mr. Donson.}
#become corrupted...
{218}{}{As there were eight people in the government, it was difficult for them to control each other. And knowing
 that all of them had at some point, their hands into some kind of "illegal business", they turned against each other
 looking for a way to take a bigger bite of this city. Sadly, anything that happened afterwards was caused by their greed,
 of which they had never been aware of.}
{219}{}{So how did their "reign of greed" end?}
{220}{}{What kind of "illegal business" were they doing?}
{221}{}{Sad story. Can I ask you something else?}
{222}{}{Thanks for your time, mayor. I'll be going now.}
#reign of greed...
{223}{}{We had help from the outside. And after days of gun fights on the streets, many people were dying on both
 sides. Still, we managed to take over the government building. The resistance was strong but we saw there was no point
 to continue the destruction of our city. So I called for a meeting with the former government members...}
{224}{}{What happened then?}
#after 214...
{225}{}{You said "sides", who else was involved?}
#illegal business...
{226}{}{For years they had been selling the city's water and fuel supplies, fooling the people by blaming bandits
 for stealing it. However, I'm not sure whether some of it was true... That's why I took those measures to stop the
 caravans from coming to this city. Until we clear things up, I won't repeat the same mistakes they did.}
{227}{}{I think it is the right thing to do. Let's change the subject...}
{228}{}{I guess that makes sense. Thanks for your time, Mr. Donson.}
#agreement...
{229}{}{I really don't know what they were up to. Whatever it was, it went with the last of the former government
 member who was exiled. That was the last time I've heard of them.}
{230}{}{One more question please?}
{231}{}{Thanks, I have to go now. See you later, Mr. Donson.}
#
{232}{}{What can you tell me about the previous government?}
#matthew job...
{233}{}{What can you tell me about your former assistant Matthew?}
#Matthew alive, alt see 258 & 259
{234}{}{Well, tough guy, that's for sure... He was one of the former government members. As you know, those were
 the times of corruption and political instability. Like his associates, he got his hands "dirty". But long before he was
 relieved of his duty we think he managed to buy enough support to ensure his political survival in the new town order,
 very much as he had done it in the past.}
{235}{}{Do you think he's planning to get his power back?}
{236}{}{I think Matthew is not going to retire just yet.}
#
{237}{}{Why do you think that?}
{238}{}{However unbelievable it may sound, he wants me to take out Eddie!}
{239}{}{He holds Eddie responsible for him being exiled and wants his head!}
#player name after 240 plus 241, spaces are set in script
{240}{}{I thought he was going to do something stupid but not this. It could put us in a politically dangerous situation
 but we must stop him. You see, if we choose to deal with Matthew with all we've got, some of his supporters will stand
 by his side and that would bring us unnecessary strife and casualties. So I think we should do it as quiet as possible so
 nobody gets suspicious. Say,}
{241}{}{can I count on you?}
{242}{}{Sure, what can I do?}
{243}{}{This is something I don't want to be involved in. I'm out of here.}
#i do...
{244}{}{This will have to be a one man operation. You have to make sure there are no witnesses to spread rumors or
 panic. We just can't afford more internal conflicts... Not after all we have gone through. [Sighs.] Do this and you will
 be doing the whole city an enormous favor.}
{245}{}{I understand your concern. I'll be back when the job is done.}
#
{246}{}{Have you resolved our "situation"?}
{247}{}{Yes, it's done. I don't believe you'll be having any problems with the locals.}
{248}{}{I'm still on it.}
#done... adds player name in between; 249 plus 250, alt see 260 plus 250, spaces are set in script
{249}{}{[He smiles.] You are setting standards for excellence here!}
{250}{}{I don't know how to thank you for this but don't worry. You deserve a lot more than I'm about to give you.
 [He gives you $7000.] Some money to cover your expenses and, knowing about your travels through the wasteland,
 this fine piece of gun-smithing is also yours. [Gives you a sniper rifle.] It will keep you safe wherever you go. Good
 luck.}
{251}{}{Thanks, I'll be going now.}
#
{252}{}{I wanted to talk about Matthew's "situation".}
{253}{}{I told you to come back after a day or so.}
#with line 168
{254}{}{Any idea where to find them?}
{255}{}{Not here, that's for sure. Since you're on the road more often than me, I'm sure you'll come across those. I
 mean they are rare but in these dire days people sell almost everything they can lay their hands on.}
{256}{}{That's not very encouraging but it's a start...}
#Eddie not dead
{257}{}{It's odd, when we checked the records, the people buried in those graves died at most two weeks ago. So this
 doesn't look like a random act, but, well, I mean... who steals dead bodies for God's sake!? [Sighs.] I can't even imagine
 why someone would do such an awful thing. We have got a major task in front of us. [Takes a deep breath.] Since my
 assistant Eddie is busy and [smiles] this is not his type of work, I have to ask for your help. I will give you $2000 for
 your trouble, interested?}
#Matthew dead before his time 12.6.2014
{258}{}{Well, he was a tough guy... one of the former government members. As you know, those were the times of
 corruption and political instability. Like his associates, he got his hands "dirty". But his early "retirement" stopped
 him from being a major setback for this community...}
{259}{}{He wasn't so excited about it. No more setbacks, I guess...}
{260}{}{It's sad but something had to be done. One less problem to worry about.}
