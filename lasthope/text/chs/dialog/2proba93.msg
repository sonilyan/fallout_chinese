{100}{}{Hey there stranger, new in town?}
{101}{}{Yep, and you are...?}
{102}{}{Sure, this is my first time here.}
#
{103}{}{I'm Darren and I'm guarding this bridge, nothing more. [Breaks into a beaming smile.] That's the best damn
 answer I've given in months. People just walk by, never say a thing. When they see someone with a gun, they
 immediately assume trouble and stay quiet. They just don't get it that I'm here to prevent that. So, what brings you here
 stranger?}
{104}{}{I travel a lot, came from the... east [you point]. I'm kinda interested... [smile]... in that gold you have around
 here... What can you tell me about this town?}
{105}{}{I stopped by to get some supplies, maybe a place for the night. What exactly is your job?}
#
{106}{}{I'm the sheriff's deputy. I've been working here for a few years now. This may seem boring at first but let me
 tell you something, it turned out to be unexpectedly profitable. You see, a town of this size attracts traders and travelers
 from hundreds of miles around. And where there are goods there are bandits following them, who then choose to camp
 in the surrounding woodland. Some of these groups bring serious firepower, but... [He smiles.]}
{107}{}{But...?}
#
{108}{}{We got the brains. We have several snipers, hidden "somewhere", covering the area. After the dust settles, all
 we have to do is to get rid of the bodies and collect the good stuff... sell some of it to the military, the rest to traders, it
 pays well enough.}
{109}{}{What kind of weapons do you sell to the military?}
#
{110}{}{Almost everything we pick up from these dead assholes. Small arms, grenades, even flamethrowers... lots of
 stuff I tell ya.}
{111}{}{Do you keep some of those weapons?}
{112}{}{Where's that military base located?}
{113}{}{Thanks for the info.}
#  keep...
{114}{}{Well, I'm limited to what I can carry which is mostly ammo but if I would come across an interesting piece,
 why not. It's not like someone is going to rise from the dead and ask for his weapon back. But if someone does, maybe
 we're already in luck as they can only use their teeth. [Laughs.] Either way, I stick with my rifle here.}
{115}{}{Right, let me ask you something else then.}
#
{116}{}{Sure, whatever I can help you with.}
{117}{}{About those weapons you were speaking of...}
{118}{}{What can you tell me about this town?}
{119}{}{Actually, there's nothing I want to ask you.}
#
{120}{}{Nice to see you again. How can I help you?}
#this town...
{121}{}{I can't tell you much since I'm mostly on duty, either guarding the bridge or walking the perimeter further out.
 I rarely take a stroll through town. [He smiles.] You can ask the sheriff, though, he's more resourceful in that regard
 than me. I'm sure he will be delighted to have a little chat with you... and dozen others, every single day. [Laughs.]}
#military base located...
{122}{}{It's on the western outskirts of town... Why do you want to know?}
{123}{}{I'm interested in buying some high tech equipment from them.}
{124}{}{I was thinking about sneaking into their base and have a good look at that armory.}
#buying or infiltrate...
{125}{}{[Smiles.] Well, good luck with that. They don't allow civilians even near the place. You have to be either
 military or someone from the law enforcement. Anyway, [whispering] just between us, I don't like those guys too much
 but their money is as good as any other. You know, speaking of business, mine started to involve more risk as bandits
 became better armed and organized. So I wanted to ask for a favor, in return I can get you something you'll find
 useful... like an access card for that military base, interested?}
{126}{}{Alright, what's on your mind?}
{127}{}{You better hand over that access card or I'll have to tell the sheriff about your little business here.}
#
{128}{}{Like I said, the threat to our society has increased. We manage to compensate our lack of manpower with
 better gear, but those things cost, and are quite rare these days. I thought you have a better chance of finding some of
 the stuff we need. Friend of mine suggested I get metal armor, said it's way better and durable than this leather stuff so
 I would like to start with that. Normally I ask one of my colleagues to do this or go by myself, but now it's too risky to
 leave my post. I can count on you, right?}
{129}{}{No problem. I'll be back with that armor.}
#
{130}{}{So, did you find the metal armor we talked about?}
{131}{}{Not yet.}
{132}{}{Sure thing, take a look. [Give him the metal armor.]}
#
{133}{}{[Looks at the armor.] That's some fine piece of equipment. I hope I can fit in. [Smiles]... Alright, this is for
 you. [He carefully slips you the access card wrapped in a piece of paper, while shaking your hand.] Just put it in
 your pocket... don't look around, someone is always watching...}
{134}{}{Right...}
#
{135}{}{Yes, I remember. What do you want to know?}
#
{136}{}{Thanks, man. I feel great in this armor. Now I can polish it every day. ::He smiles:: Take care.}
{137}{}{How are you...}
{138}{}{Hear any rumors lately?}
{139}{}{Got anything to report?}
{140}{}{You can talk to the sheriff.}
{141}{}{How do you like our town?}
{142}{}{If there is any trouble, just let me know.}
#after 144...
{143}{}{Can you help me improve my shooting skills?}
#
{144}{}{Well, you seem proficient enough. I don't think there's much you could learn from me.}
{145}{}{Alright then, thanks anyway.}
#
{146}{}{Actually, I have something better... I can give you this book. Saves both time and ammo. [Smiles.] If you
 don't mind some light reading, that's the stuff for you.}
{147}{}{Alright, thanks.}
#
{148}{}{About that armor you need...}
#
{149}{}{Have you seen any patrols from that prison on the west coast?}
#
{150}{}{Hmm... Well, I've heard about them but never actually seen any. Personally I don't see the reason why anyone
 from the west coast would bother coming all the way over here... Why do you ask?}
{151}{}{I've heard they are looking for a group of escaped criminals. I thought I'd better warn you.}
{152}{}{Some dangerous criminals were seen heading this way and my job is to find them.}
#warn you...
{153}{}{Thanks for the tip. If you come across any trouble while you're here, better report it to the sheriff because I'm
 already fully stretched out here.}
{154}{}{Alright.}
#my job...
{155}{}{I don't want to question what you do for a living but don't expect to have a friendly welcome here if you're
 hellbent on causing trouble. However, if you come across any, you'd better report it to the sheriff.}
{156}{}{Will do.}
#patrols again...
{157}{}{I believe you already asked me that. Like I said, I haven't seen any since, hmm... ever.}
{158}{}{I see.}
#...Tim and/or Dan killed
{159}{}{You have some serious explaining to do! What the hell happened!?}
{160}{}{Easy, I don't want any trouble...}
{161}{}{Calm down, let's go to the sheriff's office, I'll explain everything...}
{162}{}{Mind your own business, will you!?}
#160...
{163}{}{You already got yourself in trouble by talking to the wrong people. But this is far more serious. The sheriff
 is going to demand some answers and you better tell him! Let's go!}
{164}{}{[Go.]}
{165}{}{To hell with you!}
#
{166}{}{Move along.}
{167}{}{Nothing to see here.}
{168}{}{Keep moving.}
#added... 17.10.2017
{169}{}{...wait, I'm not done yet... [shakes your hand firmly while smiling]. Show it to the front gate guard and
 don't ask too many questions, they just might let you in. In case they don't, it's not my problem anymore, and you
 better come up with a believable backup story... Anyway, a friend of mine told me that, supposedly, most pre-war
 military security systems used these cards. So you may find it very useful at some point. [Takes a quick look around.]
 Okay, time for you to be about your business, I've got a lot of work here. Take care.}
{170}{}{Great, thanks.}
#added line for metal armor MKII 23.08.2023
{171}{}{Sure thing, take a look. [Give him the metal armor MKII.]}
