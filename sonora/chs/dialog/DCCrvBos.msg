#Questions
### {220}{}{Tell me about this place.}
{220}{}{告诉我这个地方的情况。}
### {221}{}{Casa Grande is the only oasis on the way from Tu San to Phoenix. Many caravans stop here to rest on the way and get clean water. Otherwise, the city has nothing to offer the traveler.}
{221}{}{卡萨格兰德是从屠山到凤凰城路上唯一的绿洲。许多大篷车在途中停在这里休息并获得干净的水。否则，这座城市就没有什么可以提供给旅行者的了。}
### {222}{}{Why is this city so poor?}
{222}{}{为什么这个城市这么穷？}
### {223}{}{Honestly? I have no idea. The locals earn a lot of caps from us, the caravaneers. But they can't afford basic things themselves. Partly because of the highway robbers who are ruining the highway, but this is clearly not all the reasons.}
{223}{}{真的我不知道。当地人从我们这些房车司机那里赚了很多帽子。但他们自己买不起基本的东西。部分原因是高速公路劫匪正在破坏高速公路，但这显然不是所有的原因。}
### {224}{}{It's noticeable. The city is more like a garbage dump.}
{224}{}{这很明显。这座城市更像是一个垃圾场。}

{232}{}{布斯托斯伯爵去世后，约翰・沙利文被任命为该市市长。也可能是他自己任命的，这很难说。}
