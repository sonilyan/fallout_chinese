#{550}{}{No names! It'll be better that way. I know why you're here, that's enough. That caravan taken care of?}
{550}{}{没有名字！那样会更好。我知道你为什么在这里，够了。那辆大篷车怎么办？}

#{552}{}{The caravan business is settled. All we have to do is go talk to Kevin.}
{552}{}{商队的生意解决了。我们要做的就是去找凯文谈谈。}
#{553}{}{Ummm.}
{553}{}{嗯-嗯-嗯。}
#{600}{}{So what're you waiting for? There's no point doin' this if we don't have a caravan ready.}
{600}{}{你还在等什么？如果我们没有一辆大篷车的话，这么做是没有意义的。}
#{601}{}{I'll take care of it.}

{653}{}{商队会等我们的。凯文会处理好一切的，我们只要去找他把钱还给他就行了。}

#{703}{}{Ummm.}
{703}{}{嗯。}
#{750}{}{OK, then. Now it's your turn to kidnap that little brat. You have to do it when he's out playing in the garden in the afternoon. That's the only way to get him outta there without anybody noticin'. Getting into the sheriff's compound shouldn't be a problem, the guards don't know anything, but we know one of 'em should let you in if you pay him good.}
{750}{}{那好吧。现在轮到你绑架那个小家伙了。你必须在他下午在花园里玩的时候做。那是唯一能让他在没有人注意的情况下离开那里的方法。进入警长的大院应该不是问题，警卫什么都不知道，但我们知道如果你付给他足够的钱，他们中的一个应该让你进去。}
#{751}{}{And then?}
{751}{}{然后？}
#{800}{}{We've bought off the nanny, so she'll leave you to your business. Talk that kid into keeping shut or cut his tongue out. Just get him outta there silently. And try to bring him alive. We'll take over after that.}
{800}{}{我们收买了保姆，所以她会让你管你的事。劝那孩子闭嘴，或者把舌头割下来。把他悄悄带出去。试着让他活着。之后我们再接手。}
#{801}{}{OK, that sounds easy.}
{801}{}{好吧，听起来很简单。}
#{850}{}{Great. We're already preparing the transport to Albuquerque. Here's a little advance for now. [He hands you 1000 caps.] But we've run into a little problem we gotta deal with quickly.}
{850}{}{伟大的。我们已经在准备去阿尔伯克基的交通了。现在有点进展。[他递给你1000个瓶盖]但是我们遇到了一个小问题，我们必须尽快处理。}
#{851}{}{What problem? Everything went smooth until now.}
{851}{}{什么问题？直到现在一切都很顺利。}
#{900}{}{That nanny wants to meet. I'm afraid she got scared and babbled. Anyway, that's not important, even if she asks for more money, it'll be better if you kill her. She knows too much and that makes her dangerous for us.}
{900}{}{那个保姆想见你。我怕她吓得说不出话来。不管怎样，这不重要，即使她要更多的钱，你杀了她会更好。她知道的太多了，这对我们来说很危险。}
#{901}{}{Where and when?}
{901}{}{何时何地？}
#{950}{}{You're supposed to meet her at the Crimson Caravan brahmin pens at eleven at night. Make sure you're there and you take care of her. And if she already let something out, wath out for cops. If you spot a fuzz, get your ass out in the desert.}
{950}{}{你应该在晚上11点在深红大篷车双头牛的围栏去见她。你一定要去，好好照顾她。如果她已经泄密了，注意警察。如果你发现了什么，赶紧滚到沙漠里。}
#{951}{}{One woman waggin' her tongue's not a big deal. I'll take care of her.}
{951}{}{一个女人胡言乱语没什么大不了的。我会照顾她的。}
#{1000}{}{That cunt ratted on us! You were supposed to take care of her! You're damn lucky you helped us deal with those cops. We're finished here, the kid's on the way to Albuquerque and it's getting kinda hot 'round here. Time to skitter. You go see Vex.}
{1000}{}{那个女人出卖了我们!你应该照顾好她的!帮我们对付那些警察算你走运。我们我与你在这没有交集了，孩子在去阿尔伯克基的路上，这里越来越热了。是时候突袭了。你要去找维克斯。}
#{1001}{}{Take it easy. You won't go nuts on account of a few cops, right? Maybe I'll see you at Vex's place, bye.}
{1001}{}{别紧张。你不会因为几个警察而发疯吧？也许我们在维克斯家见，再见。}
#{1050}{}{Damn, that bitch almost brought them to us. Well, as long as it's been dealt with. We're done here, the kid's on the way to Albuquerque. Go see Vex, he'll have a reward and maybe another job for you.}
{1050}{}{妈的，那婊子差点把他们带到我们这里来。好吧，至少处理好了。我与你在这没有交集了，孩子在去阿尔伯克基的路上。去看看维克斯，他会给你一份奖励，也许还会给你另一份工作。}
#{1051}{}{Good. It's about time Vex paid me some good money.}
{1051}{}{很好。维克斯该给我点钱了。}
