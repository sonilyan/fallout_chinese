{109}{}{得到了我的平静。周围有很多壁虎，所以我不能抱怨。交易一如既往地缓慢，但我做得很好。我猜，我们都有。这是一个社区的事情。我们没有多少，但我们互相帮助。这包括那些保护我们的疯子工作，我想还有斯托克曼的。 -- [Shrugs.] Got my peace and quiet. Plenty of geckos around, so I can't complain.

{114}{}{没什么。如果你需要知道的话，这里有一个公告牌。[对着它做手势。]嗯，可能已经过时了。这几天没什么意义。几乎没有访客读过。不过，我想，那里有斯托克曼和乔的车库，但他们已经不怎么好用了。还有杰克的药店卖药，昆西的药店买武器，可能是最后一个能稳定供应的人，天知道怎么回事，如果你需要接我的话，还有安娜的酒吧，还有卡尔医生，他让我们都保持运转。我们其余的人都是农民、猎人和小商贩。我们过得去。 -- Nothing really.

{117}{}{如果城里有生意，那就是他们的。他们曾经赚了一大笔钱。贸易，保护货物，投资，任何与货物有关的东西，现金和贸易，真的。但自从与矿工队的合同破裂，大篷车也不再来了，这个小镇就有点孤立，他们的生意受到了最严重的影响。嗯，除了乔的。 -- Well, if there's a business in town it's theirs.

### {119}{}{Well, there are two groups, Derek's and the Bulls. Both run some sort of militia group. Arming themselves up and protecting the town against bandits, mutants and such.

{119}{}{有两个小组，德里克和公牛。两人都经营着某种民兵组织。武装自己，保护城镇免受土匪、变种人等的袭击。嗯，他们说他们有，这一切都有点狂热。尽管如此，你可以称之为当地法律，但这完全取决于你在和谁说话。事实上，我们没有警长、法官或陪审团。所以，如果你违法了，谁知道会发生什么。也许有一天会改变，但我们并不着急。 -- Well, there are two groups, Derek's and the Bulls.

{121}{}{老实说，我怀疑有土匪在这里捣乱。我也从来没有见过任何变种人。那么他们在外面干什么呢？除了露营。[笑]但公平地说，我从来没有真正关注过他们，他们到处玩军事游戏，或者不管他们做什么，这从来没有让我感到困扰。我想他们会保护这个地区的安全，但只要他们不吓跑壁虎，我不管怎样都很好。我想最糟糕的情况是，如果两组人最终都掐住了对方的喉咙。这可能会变得一团糟。 -- To be honest, I doubt any bandits are bothering with this place.

### {123}{}{I haven't seen anyone coming this way, but I've heard of a suspicious bunch moving east. Seemed like the secretive type, didn't talk, didn't care showing their faces.
