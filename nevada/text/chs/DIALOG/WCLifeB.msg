#{100}{}{You see Jessica.}
{100}{}{你看到杰西卡了。}
#{101}{}{You see an inhabitant of the Wind of War.}
{101}{}{你看到一个居住在战争之风中的人。}
#{102}{}{Good day to you, wanderer.}
{102}{}{你好，流浪汉。}
#{103}{}{What have they done!? I don't want to see them anymore!}
{103}{}{他们做了什么！？我不想再见到他们了！}
#{110}{}{Hey, you! Stay away from my sister!}
{110}{}{嘿，你！离我妹妹远点！}
#{111}{}{Uh, sorry... They don't like it when I talk to strangers}
{111}{}{呃，对不起...他们不喜欢我和陌生人说话}
#{112}{}{Hey! We didn't let you talk to her! Get away from her!}
{112}{}{嘿！我们没让你和她说话！离她远点！}
#{120}{}{Oh, you shouldn't talk to me. My brothers went really crazy after that story with Robert. Now I'm not allowed to talk to strangers.}
{120}{}{哦，你不该和我说话。我的兄弟们在听了罗伯特的故事后都疯了。现在我不能和陌生人说话。}
#{121}{}{I just wanted to say that Robert prepares the escape. Be ready!}
{121}{}{我只想说罗伯特准备逃跑。准备好！}
#{122}{}{}
{122}{}{}
#{123}{}{So, who are you, a prisoner?}
{123}{}{那么，你是谁，一个囚犯？}
#{124}{}{Well, I'm not going to insist.}
{124}{}{好吧，我不会坚持的。}
#{125}{}{What? But... [whispering] He really decided to do it? Ah, that would be great, I'm so desperate to sit in four walls.}
{125}{}{什么？但是...他真的决定这么做？啊，那太好了，我真想坐在四面墙里。}
#{126}{}{Rather a slave. Brothers keep me locked up and not allow to talk to other men, except of "purebred" military. And it's hard to argue with them. Oh, stop it, or they will kick you out of the house.}
{126}{}{而是一个奴隶。兄弟们把我关起来，不允许和其他男人说话，除了“纯种”军人。很难和他们争论。哦，住手，否则他们会把你踢出家门的。}
#{127}{}{That's great. Wait.}
{127}{}{太好了。等待。}
#{128}{}{Quite strict morals...}
{128}{}{相当严格的道德...}
#{130}{}{Hello, stranger. Glad to see you, my brothers went really crazy after that story with Robert. They let me speak only with women and "purebred" military, and those, believe me, are not the best company.}
{130}{}{你好，陌生人。很高兴见到你，我的兄弟们在听了罗伯特的故事后都疯了。他们让我只跟女人和“纯种”军人说话，相信我，那些人不是最好的同伴。}
#{131}{}{I just wanted to say that Robert prepares the escape. Be ready!}
{131}{}{我只想说罗伯特准备逃跑。准备好！}
#{132}{}{"Purebred"? How do they define it?}
{132}{}{“纯种”？他们如何定义它？}
#{133}{}{So who are you, a prisoner?}
{133}{}{你是谁，囚犯？}
#{134}{}{Who's Robert?}
{134}{}{罗伯特是谁？}
#{135}{}{I'll talk to you later.}
{135}{}{我待会儿再跟你谈。}
#{140}{}{What? But... [whispering] He really decided to do it? Ah, that would be great, I'm so desperate to sit in four walls.}
{140}{}{什么？但是...他真的决定这么做？啊，那太好了，我真想坐在四面墙里。}
#{141}{}{You will have to sit a little longer. Just wait.}
{141}{}{你得多坐一会儿。等等。}
#{142}{}{Well, judging by the number of relatives who came from the Wasteland, we are one of the most pure-blooded families around - all members of our family are direct descendants of the first settlers. And on this stupid basis brothers created the idea of the "pure breed".}
{142}{}{好吧，从来自荒原的亲戚数量来看，我们是世界上最纯种的家庭之一――我们家的所有成员都是第一批定居者的直系后裔。在这个愚蠢的基础上，兄弟们创造了“纯种”的概念。}
#{143}{}{Rather a slave. Brothers keep me locked up and not allow to talk with other men, except of "purebred" military. And it's hard to argue.}
{143}{}{而是一个奴隶。兄弟们把我关起来，不允许和其他男人说话，除了“纯种”军人。很难争辩。}
#{144}{}{[Folds her hands and narrows the eyes] Oh, he is my symbol of hope. Although because of him my brothers are no longer allow me to communicate with outsiders, I've not been satisfied with the local life. I want freedom and love. Robert is the man who gave me all this. But don't tell my brothers, they can't stand him.}
{144}{}{[双手合十，眯起眼睛]哦，他是我希望的象征。虽然因为他，我的兄弟们不再允许我与外人交流，但我对当地的生活并不满意。我想要自由和爱。罗伯特就是给我这一切的人。但别告诉我的兄弟们，他们受不了他。}
#{1102}{}{Well, hello, wanderer.}
{1102}{}{你好，流浪者。}
