#{116}{}{[He furrows his brow] Everybody says that! Then they go outside and get shot, or die from overdose laying in trash. I get my money without lying or hurting anyone. That's better than most of the grown-ups I've met.}
{116}{}{每个人都这么说！然后他们到外面被枪杀，或者死于过量的药物躺在垃圾桶里。我得到我的钱没有撒谎或伤害任何人。这比我见过的大多数成年人都好。}

#{133}{}{Ugh, listen kid, if you keep your mouth shut and don't screw up, I'll pay you so much you can forget about work for a month!}
{133}{}{呃，听着，孩子，如果你闭上嘴不搞砸，我会付给你这么多钱，你可以一个月都忘了工作！}
#{134}{}{[He thinks about it, looking at you with doubt in his eyes] No... No, sir, this is too dangerous!}
{134}{}{[他想了想，用怀疑的眼神看着你]不。。。不，先生，这太危险了！}
