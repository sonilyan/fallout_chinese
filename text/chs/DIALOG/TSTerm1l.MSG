#{130}{}{It turns out that the hangar stretches on many floors down. Some floors cannot be viewed due to the lack of access rights. Almost every floor is a laboratory or technical workshop. Apparently, the local military had very dense schedule.}

#{131}{}{Watch the first underground floor.}
{131}{}{看地下一层。}
#{132}{}{The first underground floor is also a large laboratory. In addition, the control center of external defence line is located there (apparently, we are talking about the turrets and security cameras), along with emergency generator and control systems of force fields and outer ventilation. You fail to get access lower than the first underground level because of the strict security regulations.}
{132}{}{地下一层也是一个大型实验室。此外，外防线的控制中心也设在那里（显然，我们谈论的是炮塔和安全摄像头），以及应急发电机和力场控制系统以及外部通风。由于严格的安全规定，你无法进入地下一层以下的地方。}

#{146}{}{Notification from the employee of security service, which tells about some error in the control program of turrets. The program regularly glitched, which, in turn, led to frequent reboots. Every restart turned turrets off for a time period of 10 to 20 seconds. Despite the attempts to fix the program, engineers were unable to solve the issue. By their point of view, the blame was on the experiments at the hangar's lower levels, resulting in a strong electromagnetic waves.}
{146}{}{保安人员的通知，告知炮塔控制程序有错误。程序经常出现故障，这反过来又导致频繁的重新启动。每次重启都会关闭炮塔10到20秒。尽管有人试图修复这个程序，工程师们还是无法解决这个问题。按照他们的观点，责任在于机库较低层的实验，产生了强烈的电磁波。}
#{147}{}{The main proposition of some security employee is to install more advanced System of Security kit in place of the control turrets program. This would fix the problem of restarts and significantly improve the effectiveness of the hangar's protection systems. The response memo indicates approve of this. You are not sure, but looks like system like this is used in your Vault.}
{147}{}{一些安全员工的主要建议是安装更先进的安全套件系统，以取代控制炮塔程序。这将解决重新启动的问题，并显著提高机库保护系统的有效性。回复备忘录表示同意。你不确定，但看起来你的保险库中使用了这样的系统。}
#{148}{}{As listed on the receipt, the employee of security service has received complete and working SoS kit. The kit was brought from Hawthorne after field tests, then further upgraded by local engineers, based on the reports from these tests. The security service ordered to connect the kit to the security systems and see if it works as intended.}
{148}{}{如收据所示，安全部门的员工已收到完整且有效的SoS工具包。该工具包是在现场测试后从霍桑带来的，然后由当地工程师根据这些测试的报告进一步升级。安全部门下令将该套件与安全系统连接起来，看它是否按预期工作。}
#{149}{}{As listed in the report, the installation of SoS kit from Hawthorne did not produce expected results. The kit, for an unknown reason, didn't work. The manufacturer sent a statement about the need to retest the kit, but no response was given. Apparently, the military had no time to continue due to the outbreak of Great War. In the end, the hangar was left without any external protection - turrets were temporarily disabled.}
{149}{}{如报告所列，安装霍桑公司的SoS工具包并未产生预期结果。不知什么原因，这套工具不起作用。制造商发了一份声明，说明有必要重新测试药盒，但没有得到答复。显然，由于大战的爆发，军队没有时间继续作战。最后，机库没有任何外部保护――炮塔被暂时关闭。}

The order was directed to the maintenance sector, leading to correction on operating mode of force fields.}
{154}{}{保安处建议使用个人钥匙卡分别控制警力场。在当前状态下，任何具有平均访问级别的工作人员都可以启用或禁用所有这些功能，这显然不符合安全标准。指挥部下令对力场进行重新编程，并生产一套加密程度高的磁性钥匙卡。该命令已下达给维修部门，导致对力场工作模式的修正。}

#{164}{}{Although the vaults network was not in the Area 51's responsibility, the vault 8 became an exception. The reason for this was assigned to the vault status of the governmental facility. In an emergency situation Area 51 should have contributed to the protection of the vault, but not intervene in internal affairs. There was even some initiative to set force field barrier around the territory, but the time and funding were not enough, since the project already had too many resources allocated to it. The vault's security functions by default were assigned to Hawthorne military base, however, in case of its inability to perform such functions, the task should have been passed to Area 51.}
{164}{}{尽管51区不负责金库网络，但8号金库成为例外。原因是政府设施的金库状态。在紧急情况下，51区本应为保护金库作出贡献，但不应干涉内政。甚至有人倡议在领土周围设置部队阵地屏障，但时间和资金不够，因为该项目已经分配了太多的资源。默认情况下，金库的安全功能分配给霍桑军事基地，但是，如果该基地无法履行这些功能，则该任务应移交给51区。}
