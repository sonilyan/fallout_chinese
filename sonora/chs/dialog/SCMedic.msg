### {100}{}{You see a doctor.}
{100}{}{你去看医生。}
### {101}{}{Here is a doctor. If it wasn't for the robe, you wouldn't have distinguished him from an ordinary soldier.}
{101}{}{这是一位医生。如果不是因为那件长袍，你就不会把他和普通士兵区分开来。}
### {102}{}{If I don't hurry up, then I won't need the services of a doctor anymore.}
{102}{}{如果我不抓紧时间，我就不需要医生的服务了。}
### {103}{}{?}
{103}{}{？}

### {200}{}{(he rubs his hands, carefully examining you) A civilian? I don't remember the order about recruits.}
{200}{}{（他揉搓双手，仔细打量着你）一个平民？我不记得关于新兵的命令了。}
### {201}{}{Yes, I don't serve the Brotherhood.}
{201}{}{是的，我不为兄弟会服务。}
### {202}{}{We have an infirmary here. And I am forbidden to serve civilians without an appropriate order.}
{202}{}{我们这里有一间医务室。我被禁止在没有适当命令的情况下为平民服务。}
### {203}{}{Sorry to distract.}
{203}{}{抱歉打扰了。}
### {204}{}{Clear. Goodbye.}
{204}{}{清楚的再见}
### {205}{}{So are you the rookie?}
{205}{}{你是菜鸟吗？}
### {206}{}{Yes, I'm a rookie. The enrollment order has already been issued.}
{206}{}{是的，我是个新手。已发布注册命令。}
### {207}{}{Good. Because otherwise I would have thrown you out of the infirmary. Civilians are not allowed to appear here.}
{207}{}{好的因为否则我会把你赶出医务室的。平民不允许出现在这里。}
### {208}{}{I just need treatment.}
{208}{}{我只是需要治疗。}
### {209}{}{It won't be necessary. I'm leaving anyway.}
{209}{}{没有必要。我无论如何都要离开。}

### {210}{}{What happened?}
{210}{}{发生了什么？}
### {211}{}{Nothing. See you later, doc.}
{211}{}{没有什么回头见，医生。}
### {212}{}{Is something wrong?}
{212}{}{有什么不对劲吗？}

### {213}{}{Can I ask you a few questions?}
{213}{}{我能问你几个问题吗？}
### {214}{}{Not worth it. The position of a military doctor taught me to keep my mouth shut in peacetime. Except, of course, conversations with senior officials. They need to know everything about everything.}
{214}{}{不值得。军医的职位教会了我在和平时期要守口如瓶。当然，除了与高级官员的谈话。他们需要了解一切。}
### {215}{}{Okay, Doc, in that case, I'll look for another victim.}
{215}{}{好吧，医生，那样的话，我会去找另一个受害者。}

### {220}{}{I want to talk about Novice Corwin.}
{220}{}{我想谈谈科温新手。}
### {221}{}{What about him? Is this bugger in some kind of trouble again?}
{221}{}{他呢？这家伙又遇到什么麻烦了吗？}
### {222}{}{He needs a shore leave.}
{222}{}{他需要休假。}
### {223}{}{What, again? The guy is too flimsy for this kind of work. They shouldn't have taken him with them. I would sit at the base and clean my guns. But what does that have to do with me?}
{223}{}{又是什么？这家伙太脆弱了，不适合做这种工作。他们不应该把他带走。我会坐在基地清洗我的枪。但这和我有什么关系？}
### {224}{}{I don't even know. I just wanted to discuss it with someone. Goodbye.}
{224}{}{我甚至不知道。我只是想和某人讨论一下。再见}
### {225}{}{It occurred to me that you could write him a discharge ticket for health reasons.}
{225}{}{我突然想到，出于健康原因，你可以给他开一张出院单。}
### {226}{}{Could. But why would I do that?}
{226}{}{能够但我为什么要这么做？}
### {227}{}{Probably not for anything. I'm sorry to distract you for nothing. Bye.}
{227}{}{可能不是为了什么。很抱歉让你分心。再见}
### {228}{}{Well, I can get some medical supplies. You must be missing something.}
{228}{}{嗯，我可以买一些医疗用品。你一定错过了什么。}
### {229}{}{Good. Bring five stimpacks or one of the army drugs, and then your friend will get a ticket from me.}
{229}{}{好的带上五个刺激包或一种军药，然后你的朋友会收到我的罚单。}
### {230}{}{I will think about this proposal.}
{230}{}{我会考虑这个建议。}
### {231}{}{Here are five stimpacks.}
{231}{}{这里有五个刺激包。}
### {232}{}{I can share psycho.}
{232}{}{我可以分享精神病。}
### {233}{}{I have a buffout.}
{233}{}{我有一个小丑。}
### {234}{}{That's enough. Good deal.}
{234}{}{够了。很划算。}
### {235}{}{I'm going to please the novice.}
{235}{}{我要取悦新手。}

### {240}{}{Hey, Doc. I was recently enlisted in the Brotherhood's intelligence squad.}
{240}{}{嘿，医生。我最近加入了兄弟会的情报小组。}
### {241}{}{So, great. That is, now I will have more work. Well, congratulations on the promotion.}
{241}{}{太好了。也就是说，现在我将有更多的工作。恭喜你升职了。}
### {242}{}{What's wrong with the scouts?}
{242}{}{侦察兵怎么了？}
### {243}{}{Scouts are most often exposed to radiation and poisoning. Therefore, you consume medicines the most, and even take them with you on the road. And medicines are hard to get in our conditions. Especially Radaway.}
{243}{}{童子军最常受到辐射和中毒的影响。因此，你消耗药物最多，甚至在路上也会随身携带。而且在我们的条件下很难买到药物。尤其是拉达威。}
### {244}{}{So, wait, do I get some kind of set of medications?}
{244}{}{等等，我有什么药吗？}
### {245}{}{Radaway, antidote and stimpack - here is your survival kit. Spend it wisely, or even better - avoid dangerous places altogether.}
{245}{}{Radaway，解药和刺激药-这是你的生存装备。明智地使用它，甚至更好――完全避开危险的地方。}
### {246}{}{Okay. Thanks, Doc.}
{246}{}{可以谢谢，医生。}

### {250}{}{Can you fix me up, Doc?}
{250}{}{你能帮我搞定吗，医生？}
### {251}{}{I'm not allowed to serve civilians without a special order. Otherwise, we may not have enough medicines ourselves. Turn to the Followers of the Apocalypse in Casa Nueva, they will cure anyone for just one kiss.}
{251}{}{没有特别命令，我不能为平民服务。否则，我们自己可能没有足够的药物。转向努瓦之家的启示录追随者，他们只需一个吻就能治愈任何人。}
### {252}{}{Thanks for the referral. I will try not to die before I get there.}
{252}{}{谢谢你的推荐。我会尽量不在到达那里之前死去。}
### {253}{}{And it immediately became clear to me that ordinary citizens mean nothing to you. Goodbye, knacker.}
{253}{}{我立刻明白了，普通公民对你们来说毫无意义。再见，骗子。}
### {254}{}{Treat me, doc.}
{254}{}{请款待我，医生。}
### {255}{}{You're all right now. Now take your rifle and go back to the front line.}
{255}{}{你现在没事了。现在带上你的步枪回到前线去。}
### {256}{}{It will be done, Doc!}
{256}{}{一定会成功的，医生！}
### {257}{}{Stupid joke, smartass.}
{257}{}{愚蠢的笑话，聪明的家伙。}

### {260}{}{What's that shouting, Doc? Are you torturing someone?}
{260}{}{医生，你在喊什么？你在折磨别人吗？}
### {261}{}{Oh no. This is our valiant soldier going crazy. Severe case with acute mental disorder.}
{261}{}{哦，不。这是我们英勇的士兵疯了。严重急性精神障碍病例。}
### {262}{}{What is the expression of his illness?}
{262}{}{他的病是怎么表现的？}
### {263}{}{The patient cannot serve due to insomnia and headaches. He even claims to hear voices in his head... Just a minute. I can't discuss this with outsiders. Although the case is really complicated.}
{263}{}{病人由于失眠和头痛而不能服务。他甚至声称能听到脑子里的声音...等一下我不能和外人讨论这个问题。虽然这个案子真的很复杂。}
### {264}{}{Maybe he's faking it?}
{264}{}{也许他在假装？}
### {265}{}{What about? For the Brotherhood soldier to fake it? I do not think so. But it is not excluded. Lately, everyone in our fort has been homesick in California.}
{265}{}{那么...怎么样让兄弟会的士兵伪造？我不这么认为，但也不排除。最近，我们堡垒里的每个人都想家。}
### {266}{}{If you can't handle it, let me try.}
{266}{}{如果你不能应付，让我试试。}
### {267}{}{Hmm, otherwise I'd spank you and throw you out the door. But this problem cannot be solved without outside help. I'm not a psychologist, but what can you do?}
{267}{}{嗯，否则我会打你屁股，然后把你扔出门外。但是，如果没有外界的帮助，这个问题是无法解决的。我不是心理学家，但你能做什么？}
### {268}{}{I need to talk to the patient first. Give me five minutes, Doc.}
{268}{}{我需要先和病人谈谈。给我五分钟，医生。}
### {269}{}{Are you sure he's not faking it?}
{269}{}{你确定他没有假装吗？}
### {270}{}{And what is the expression of his illness?}
{270}{}{他的病是怎么表现的？}
### {271}{}{Surely you know how to cure it. Goodbye, doc.}
{271}{}{你肯定知道怎么治的。再见，医生。}
### {272}{}{It looks like Bell is really suffering from severe psychological trauma.}
{272}{}{看起来贝尔确实受到了严重的心理创伤。}
### {273}{}{I've already figured that out. But what to do?}
{273}{}{我已经想明白了。但是该怎么办呢？}
### {274}{}{He was talking about some kind of ash desert. What could it mean?}
{274}{}{他说的是某种灰烬沙漠。这意味着什么？}
### {275}{}{Hmm. I don't even have any ideas. Actually, the disease manifested itself after one of the forays into the desert. Talk to his companions in the mess, perhaps they will be able to unravel this image.}
{275}{}{嗯，我甚至没有任何想法。事实上，这种疾病是在一次沙漠探险后表现出来的。和他在混乱中的同伴交谈，也许他们能够解开这张照片。}
### {276}{}{Okay, goodbye, doc.}
{276}{}{好吧，再见，医生。}
### {277}{}{After your conversation, Bell became calm. He had a good night's sleep and was refreshed. What did you tell him?}
{277}{}{经过你的谈话，贝尔变得很冷静。他睡了个好觉，精神抖擞。你跟他说了什么？}
### {1277}{}{After your conversation, Bell became calm. He had a good night's sleep and was refreshed. What did you tell him?}
{1277}{}{经过你的谈话，贝尔变得很冷静。他睡了个好觉，精神抖擞。你跟他说了什么？}
### {278}{}{Nothing special. Just good old-fashioned psychotherapy.}
{278}{}{没什么特别的。只是很好的老式心理治疗。}
### {279}{}{That's how. Interesting. I wish I could succeed in this business. I'm more into lacerations and contusions. And it's a little scary to climb into the subconscious.}
{279}{}{就是这样。有趣的我希望我能在这方面取得成功。我更喜欢撕裂伤和挫伤。进入潜意识有点可怕。}
### {280}{}{All is not lost yet, doc.}
{280}{}{一切还没有失去，医生。}
### {281}{}{That's for sure. Better mind your own business.}
{281}{}{这是肯定的。最好管好自己的事。}
### {282}{}{Thank you. I also want to share my medical experience with you. Here, take this surgical kit and a couple of stimpacks as a token of gratitude.}
{282}{}{非常感谢。我也想和大家分享我的医疗经验。拿着这个手术包和几个刺激包表示感谢。}
### {283}{}{Thanks, Doc. Goodbye.}
{283}{}{谢谢，医生。再见}
