### {100}{}{You see a settler.}
{100}{}{你看到一个定居者。}
### {101}{}{Here is one of the residents of the cafe.}
{101}{}{这是咖啡馆的一位居民。}
### {102}{}{Leave before I change my mind.}
{102}{}{在我改变主意之前离开。}
### {103}{}{Ugh, this family definitely has something to hide.}
{103}{}{啊，这家人肯定有什么要隐瞒的。}
### {104}{}{He looks delicious. Honey, cut off my thigh.}
{104}{}{他看起来很好吃。亲爱的，切掉我的大腿。}
### {105}{}{The filth in this place is over.}
{105}{}{这个地方的污秽已经结束了。}
### {106}{}{You should have been nicer to me.}
{106}{}{你本应该对我好一点的。}

### {200}{}{Ah, a traveler straight from the wasteland! It's nice to see a new face in these sparsely populated areas. Where are you from?}
{200}{}{啊，一个来自荒原的旅行家！在这些人烟稀少的地区看到一张新面孔真是太好了。你是哪里人？}
### {201}{}{From a small village far from here.}
{201}{}{来自一个远离这里的小村庄。}
### {202}{}{Better not ask me about it. Is that clear?}
{202}{}{最好别问我这件事。清楚吗？}
### {203}{}{Okay, whatever you say. And we have been living here for many years. Do you want to spend the night? Please - we have a lot of free space. Besides, the pies will be ready soon. You should stay, believe me, they're just great.}
{203}{}{好吧，不管你说什么。我们已经在这里生活了很多年。你想过夜吗？求你了，我们有很多空闲空间。此外，馅饼很快就会做好。你应该留下来，相信我，他们太棒了。}
### {204}{}{Uh, I'll think about your offer.}
{204}{}{呃，我会考虑一下你的报价。}

### {210}{}{How can we help?}
{210}{}{我们能提供什么帮助？}
### {211}{}{I'm just looking around.}
{211}{}{我只是四处看看。}
### {212}{}{Can I look around here?}
{212}{}{我可以看看这里吗？}
### {213}{}{Sure. But don't go into the back room. This is our private property.}
{213}{}{当然但是不要进后面的房间。这是我们的私人财产。}
### {214}{}{Of course, no problem.}
{214}{}{当然，没问题。}
### {215}{}{Sounds like something not very good. I will keep in mind.}
{215}{}{听起来不太好。我会记住的。}
### {216}{}{How do you survive in the middle of a scorched desert?}
{216}{}{你是如何在焦土的沙漠中生存的？}
### {217}{}{If you want to live, you'll find ways. We feed on lizards, scorpions and all sorts of small animals. We collect water from the night condensate. It happens that rare travelers leave some things like cartridges. This is quite enough for us in such a modest company.}
{217}{}{如果你想活下去，你会想办法的。我们以蜥蜴、蝎子和各种各样的小动物为食。我们从夜间冷凝水中收集水。碰巧罕见的旅行者会留下一些东西，比如子弹。对于我们这样一家规模不大的公司来说，这已经足够了。}
### {218}{}{Do you live here alone?}
{218}{}{你一个人住在这里吗？}
### {219}{}{Well yes. Our parents used to live with us, but the wasteland took them away from us. Occasionally travelers and caravaneers stop here.}
{219}{}{是的。我们的父母曾经和我们住在一起，但荒地把他们从我们身边带走了。偶尔旅行者和房车司机会在这里停留。}
### {220}{}{You know, it's hard to find genuine friendliness nowadays.}
{220}{}{你知道，现在很难找到真正的友善。}
### {221}{}{Oh, yes, I understand. People in the villages do not trust each other, there is not enough food and water for everyone. Don't worry, there are other mores here. We do not condemn anyone and we do not want to deceive anyone.}
{221}{}{哦，是的，我理解。村子里的人们互相不信任，没有足够的食物和水给每个人。别担心，这里还有其他习俗。我们不谴责任何人，也不想欺骗任何人。}
### {222}{}{This cafe looks very old. How long have you lived here?}
{222}{}{这家咖啡馆看起来很旧。你在这里住多久了？}
### {223}{}{We got this cafe from our parents. And to them - from their parents. And so many generations ago. This is a very old place.}
{223}{}{这家咖啡馆是我们父母给我们的。还有他们的父母。许多代人以前。这是一个非常古老的地方。}
### {224}{}{What is so important in your back room?}
{224}{}{你的后屋里有什么重要的东西？}
### {225}{}{Only personal belongings and a place to sleep. Don't get me wrong, this is our personal space. None of the outsiders can go in there. And this is the only thing we ask of outsiders.}
{225}{}{只有私人物品和睡觉的地方。别误会，这是我们的私人空间。外人都不能进去。这是我们对局外人唯一的要求。}
### {226}{}{Do you have anything to exchange?}
{226}{}{你有什么要交换的吗？}
### {227}{}{If you have something useful, then I don't mind exchanging. Look around, what do you need?}
{227}{}{如果你有有用的东西，那么我不介意交换。环顾四周，你需要什么？}
### {228}{}{Do you accept bottle caps?}
{228}{}{你接受瓶盖吗？}
### {229}{}{What are you talking about? Why do I need caps? Leave this nonsense. I would never believe that people in cities are exchanging for these useless things. We always threw them away like garbage.}
{229}{}{你在说什么？为什么我需要瓶盖？别胡说八道了。我永远不会相信城市里的人们在用这些无用的东西交换。我们总是把它们像垃圾一样扔掉。}
### {230}{}{Do you mind chatting about something else?}
{230}{}{你介意聊点别的吗？}
### {231}{}{Something else?}
{231}{}{还有别的吗？}
### {232}{}{Nothing, I'm going to rest from the road.}
{232}{}{没什么，我要在路上休息。}

### {250}{}{Well, well. I should have shot you right away. I always told my sister not to talk too much with strangers.}
{250}{}{嗯，嗯。我本该马上开枪打死你的。我总是告诉我姐姐不要和陌生人多说话。}
### {251}{}{Remember when I said I didn't believe in pleasantries on the wastelands? And it was not in vain.}
{251}{}{还记得我说过我不相信荒原上的玩笑吗？这并没有白费。}
### {1251}{}{Remember when I said I didn't believe in pleasantries on the wastelands? And it was not in vain.}
{1251}{}{还记得我说过我不相信荒原上的玩笑吗？这并没有白费。}
### {252}{}{What do you understand? We live in the middle of the desert, where there is nothing - no crops, no animals, no settlements. Rare travelers are the only way to survive in such difficult conditions.}
{252}{}{你明白什么？我们生活在沙漠中央，那里什么都没有――没有农作物，没有动物，没有定居点。罕见的旅行者是在如此困难的条件下生存的唯一途径。}
### {253}{}{So why not get out of this hell? Somewhere in the distance there are whole cities...}
{253}{}{那为什么不离开这个地狱呢？远处的某个地方有整座城市...}
### {254}{}{Nonsense! You all tell these stories, but they are all different. I don't trust outsiders anymore. To leave this cafe, where you have lived all your life, for the sake of dubious stories is certain death. And we want to live.}
{254}{}{胡说你们都讲这些故事，但它们都不一样。我不再相信外人了。离开这家你生活了一辈子的咖啡馆，为了一些可疑的故事，肯定是死亡。我们想活下去。}
### {255}{}{So you're just a fool.}
{255}{}{所以你只是个傻瓜。}
### {256}{}{Yes... perhaps. But this fool has outsmarted the stranger for the hundredth time. And he will survive. But you don't.}
{256}{}{对可能但这个傻瓜已经第一百次智胜陌生人了。他会活下来的。但你没有。}
### {257}{}{Hey...}
{257}{}{嘿}
### {258}{}{Exactly. You had a chance before. And now it's too late, you fool...}
{258}{}{确切地你以前有机会。现在已经太晚了，你这个傻瓜...}
### {1258}{}{Exactly. You had a chance before. And now it's too late, stupid...}
{1258}{}{确切地你以前有机会。现在已经太晚了，愚蠢的...}
### {259}{}{So, how do you survive in this barren desert - kill travelers and make a kebab out of them?}
{259}{}{那么，你如何在这片贫瘠的沙漠中生存――杀死旅行者，用他们做烤肉串？}
### {260}{}{So this conversation will have only one outcome. Your death.}
{260}{}{所以这次对话只有一个结果。你的死。}
### {261}{}{Stop talking. I will rid the wasteland of such parasites as your family.}
{261}{}{别说话了。我会把你家这样的寄生虫从荒原上清除掉。}
### {262}{}{Wait, you're making a big mistake...}
{262}{}{等等，你犯了一个大错误...}
### {263}{}{Wait. I'm telling the truth. There are big cities in the wastelands. There's plenty of room for your family. Living in the desert, you only condemn yourself to a slow death.}
{263}{}{等待我说的是实话。荒原上有大城市。有足够的空间容纳你的家人。生活在沙漠中，你只会让自己慢慢死去。}
### {264}{}{Hmm... It's strange that outsiders talk about cities so often. Maybe it's true... Do you know where we can go? Show me. I want to know.}
{264}{}{嗯…奇怪的是，外地人经常谈论城市。也许这是真的...你知道我们能去哪里吗？给我看看，我想知道。}
### {265}{}{OK, but after that you'll let me go. Okay?}
{265}{}{好吧，但之后你会放我走的。可以}
### {266}{}{To hell with it. People like you have no place in a civilized society.}
{266}{}{见鬼去吧，像你这样的人在文明社会里没有立足之地。}
### {267}{}{Eh? Who is it we have here? It's a thief. I've been told that thieves have their hands cut off in cities. I'll do the same. It's going to be very, very painful.}
{267}{}{呃？我们这里有谁？是个小偷。有人告诉我，城市里的小偷会被砍断双手。我也会这么做。这将是非常非常痛苦的。}
### {268}{}{Go to hell, you filthy cannibal.}
{268}{}{见鬼去吧，你这个肮脏的食人族。}
