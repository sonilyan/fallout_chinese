#The first dialog
### {200}{}{Hey, native. Even if you were given a pass, this does not mean that you can walk around the ship and distract people from their service.}

{203}{}{分散服务注意力？你只是坐在餐厅里无所事事。}

{210}{}{啊，这是我们的新英雄。一个来自沙漠的暴发户，他超过了所有退伍军人的总和。不错。但不要以为你会那么容易被兄弟会接纳。}
### {211}{}{I understand your displeasure. And I will do everything to make the brotherhood accept me.}
{211}{}{我理解你的不满。我会尽一切努力让兄弟会接受我。}
### {212}{}{Then remember. Many swore in blood that they would not betray our brotherhood. Those who tried paid for it with their lives in the most horrific way.}
{212}{}{那就记住。许多人用鲜血发誓，他们不会背叛我们的兄弟情谊。那些尝试过的人以最可怕的方式付出了生命的代价。}
### {213}{}{I don't care about your opinion. And the opinion of others. If someone doesn't like my presence, let them go to hell.}
{213}{}{我不在乎你的意见。以及其他人的意见。如果有人不喜欢我的存在，那就让他们见鬼去吧。}
### {214}{}{Hmm. There's enough iron in your blood. Let's see how much it will last.}

### {283}{}{What's wrong with a child on a ship?}

### {285}{}{The father is a paladin. And who is the mother?}

### {286}{}{Look, it's none of your business. Is that clear? Why do you care so much about someone else's past? Worry about your present.}

### {290}{}{Tell me about your Brotherhood.}

### {291}{}{Heh, what does ignorance like you need to know about Brotherhood? Only that there is no greater power in the Wastelands than we are.}

### {292}{}{I believe it willingly. That's the end of the conversation about the Brotherhood.}
{292}{}{我很乐意相信。关于兄弟会的谈话到此结束。}
### {293}{}{It sounds loud, but I don't hear much about you in Arizona.}
{293}{}{听起来声音很大，但我在亚利桑那州很少听到你的消息。}

{294}{}{但我们在加利福尼亚州很有名。他们知道并害怕，因为是我们摧毁了造物主和他的整个军队。什么，你不知道吗？天啊，这个国家要去哪里。。。}

{295}{}{我不会争辩的。但是你做了什么让人害怕呢？}

{303}{}{继续}
### {304}{}{That's not a bad idea.}
{304}{}{这不是个坏主意。}

### {306}{}{And what did you do?}
{306}{}{你做了什么？}
### {307}{}{And you didn't like it, of course?}
{307}{}{你当然不喜欢吗？}

{308}{}{这是一个光荣的战斗和伟大胜利的一年。我们打败了造物主的军队，并用核爆炸摧毁了他。在一些地方仍然有他的党羽残余，但他们不再构成以前的威胁。}

{311}{}{哦，当然。这里的每个人都有自己的战斗历史。例如，我在夜光之战中处于守势。这是一场光荣的大屠杀。}
### {312}{}{Surely you've embellished everything.}
{312}{}{你肯定把一切都美化了。}
### {313}{}{The brotherhood never lies. Talk to any knight or paladin - there are many who participated in those battles. I myself held the defense in the battle at the Dayglow.}
{313}{}{兄弟情谊从不说谎。与任何骑士或圣骑士交谈――有很多人参加过这些战斗。我自己在曙光号的战斗中担任防御。}
### {314}{}{Will you tell me how it was?}
{314}{}{你能告诉我情况如何吗？}
### {315}{}{It seems there's no stopping you.}
{315}{}{似乎没有什么能阻止你。}
### {316}{}{After the defeat, the super mutants fled in all directions from their base. The largest groups captured small settlements on their way. Junktown, Necropolis, Dayglow, even the Hub was attacked. We tried to respond to requests for help.}
{316}{}{战败后，超级变种人从他们的基地向四面八方逃跑。最大的团体在途中占领了一些小定居点。Junktown，Necropolis，Dayglow，甚至Hub都遭到了攻击。我们尽力回应求助请求。}
### {317}{}{It's very noble of you to help ordinary residents.}
{317}{}{你帮助普通居民真是太高尚了。}
### {318}{}{Yeah. As if you were doing it out of the goodness of your heart.}
{318}{}{是 啊就好像你这么做是出于内心的善良。}
### {319}{}{Intelligence reported that the super Mutants had set up a major outpost in the Glare of the Day. Our squad was supposed to destroy them, but the task was not easy. The enemy organized a fort, and around the fort - a complex system of anti-personnel traps and trenches. In addition, although the locals wanted to get rid of these monsters, they were not happy with us either.}
{319}{}{情报部门报告称，超级变种人已经在日之光建立了一个主要的前哨基地。我们的小队本应摧毁他们，但任务并不容易。敌人组织了一座堡垒，并在堡垒周围――一个由杀伤人员陷阱和战壕组成的复杂系统。此外，尽管当地人想除掉这些怪物，但他们对我们也不满意。}
### {320}{}{Go on.}
{320}{}{继续}
### {321}{}{Of course. Who would like to be between two lines of fire?}
{321}{}{当然谁愿意置身于两道火线之间？}
### {322}{}{The siege lasted two weeks. Due to the distance from the main base, we could not count on supplies and got out as best we could - smoked out the enemy with a smoke pipe, flooded bunkers with toxic barrels, used local criminals to create blockages. The super mutants were cut off from the outside world and could not receive provisions.}
{322}{}{围攻持续了两个星期。由于距离主基地很远，我们无法指望补给，只能尽最大努力撤离――用烟管熏死敌人，用有毒桶淹没掩体，利用当地罪犯制造封锁。超级变种人被切断了与外界的联系，无法获得食物。}
### {323}{}{Did you starve them to death?}
{323}{}{你饿死他们了吗？}
### {324}{}{And do you think this is a glorious battle?}
{324}{}{你认为这是一场光荣的战斗吗？}
### {325}{}{At the end of the second week, the super mutants had no choice. Some of them surrendered, while others tried to break out of the siege. The last fight was the fiercest and hardest. Our commander showed unprecedented skill in tactics. If we had undertaken the siege of the fort at the very beginning, I would not be telling this story now.}
{325}{}{第二周结束时，超级变种人别无选择。他们中的一些人投降了，而另一些人则试图突围。最后一场战斗是最激烈、最艰苦的。我们的指挥官表现出了前所未有的战术技巧。如果我们一开始就围攻堡垒，我现在就不会讲这个故事了。}
### {326}{}{Wow, you really are stronger than anyone you can find nowadays.}
{326}{}{哇，你真的比你现在能找到的任何人都强壮。}
### {327}{}{Yes, you seem to be able to fight.}
{327}{}{是的，你似乎能战斗。}
### {328}{}{Sitting under siege is not particularly impressive.}
{328}{}{坐在被包围的地方并不是特别令人印象深刻。}
### {329}{}{Don't worry, son. We'll turn Arizona into a civilized place, too. Just give me time.}
{329}{}{别担心，儿子。我们也将把亚利桑那州变成一个文明的地方。只要给我时间。}
### {1329}{}{Don't worry, lady. We'll turn Arizona into a civilized place, too. Just give me time.}
{1329}{}{别担心，女士。我们也将把亚利桑那州变成一个文明的地方。只要给我时间。}

### {331}{}{I have no doubt at all after all I've heard. And thanks a lot for the story.}
{331}{}{听了这么多，我一点也不怀疑。非常感谢你的故事。}
### {332}{}{I wouldn't want something like this to happen in Arizona. Good luck, man with a gun.}

### {340}{}{You know what happened to Paladin Bell, right?}
{340}{}{你知道圣骑士贝尔的遭遇吧？}
### {341}{}{What's it to you? You don't even know him, and we fought shoulder to shoulder. Leave him, it's none of your business.}
{341}{}{你怎么了？你甚至不认识他，我们并肩作战。离开他，这不关你的事。}
### {1341}{}{What's it to you? You don't even know him, and we fought shoulder to shoulder. Leave him, it's none of your business.}
{1341}{}{你怎么了？你甚至不认识他，我们并肩作战。离开他，这不关你的事。}
### {342}{}{I'm trying to cure him. And for that I need details.}
{342}{}{我正在设法治好他。为此，我需要详细信息。}
### {343}{}{It was during your battles that his tower was torn off, right?}
{343}{}{在你们的战斗中，他的塔被拆掉了，对吧？}
### {344}{}{What are you... Ah, well. Listen, we were on different patrols with him. And the tower was torn off for him already here. Therefore, he could get his injury anywhere.}
{344}{}{你是什么。。。啊，好吧。听着，我们和他在不同的巡逻队。塔已经在这里为他拆除了。因此，他可能在任何地方受伤。}
### {345}{}{He was talking about some kind of ash desert in hell. What do you think it means?}
{345}{}{他说的是地狱里的灰烬沙漠。你认为这意味着什么？}
### {346}{}{An ash-colored desert? I don't even know... Although there is one place near Casa Nueva. Cement was mined there, so everything is gray.}
{346}{}{灰白色的沙漠？我甚至不知道。。。尽管在努瓦之家附近有一个地方。那里开采了水泥，所以一切都是灰色的。}
### {347}{}{Did you have a task there?}
{347}{}{你在那里有任务吗？}
### {348}{}{I didn't tell you that, but at some point in the career, workers began to disappear. One by one. We were sent to deal with this problem.}
{348}{}{我没有告诉你，但在职业生涯的某个阶段，工人开始消失。一个接一个。我们被派去处理这个问题。}
### {349}{}{Go on.}
{349}{}{继续}
### {350}{}{We found the gutted remains of people, as if someone had torn them apart. But neither the maniac nor the beast was found. Bell was with us, too. That was the first time we felt that something was wrong with him.}
{350}{}{我们发现了被掏空的人的遗体，好像有人把他们撕成了碎片。但疯子和野兽都没有找到。贝尔也和我们在一起。那是我们第一次感觉到他出了问题。}
### {351}{}{So, the quarry in Casa Nueva. That's something. Thanks and bye.}
{351}{}{所以，Casa Nueva的采石场。这很了不起。谢谢，再见。}
