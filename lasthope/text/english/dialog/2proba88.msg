{100}{}{What a sissy...}
{101}{}{He sure didn't expect that. ::laughs::}
{102}{}{And look what it got me.}
{103}{}{No way...}
{104}{}{Who was there...}
{105}{}{Anything interesting...}
#
{106}{}{What the hell do you want, can't you see I'm thinking here!? }
{107}{}{Someone told me you guys were harassing some little kid?}
{108}{}{Sure, nevermind.}
#
{109}{}{[Pointing at you.] You again! You've got some serious issues by coming here again... are you lost or somethin'!?}
#little kid...
{110}{}{[Smiles.] It was me... But I wasn't harassing that little fucker, he acted disrespectful. I gave him a couple
 of caps and he throw them on the ground. I said to myself, this little brat has no manners! He didn't want to pick them
 up and even called me names. No one insults me in front of my friends! So I slapped him once and he went home
 crying.}
{111}{}{[Raise your voice.] Did you slap his father too!?}
{112}{}{How about some shooting lessons, you can play the dummy!}
# did...
{113}{}{Hey asshole, raise your voice again, and I'll raise your ass to the heavens!}
{114}{}{Easy now... I'm sorry...}
{115}{}{Alright wise guy, time to play.}
#
{116}{}{Right... You must be here for a reason, so spit it out...}
{117}{}{I want to make a deal with you...}
{118}{}{I just wanted to take your measurements for... The special coffin I just ordered for you!}
#
{119}{}{[Talking to his men.] Hey, mister nice guy wants a deal... [Rubs his hands.] Let's hear it, I'm all ears!}
{120}{}{I can pay you some money just to leave that kid and his father alone... about $500. It's all I got. What do you say?}
{121}{}{I can pay you some money just to leave that kid and his father alone... about $1000. It's all I got. What do you say?}
{122}{}{I can pay you some money just to leave that kid and his father alone... about $1500. It's all I got. What do you say?}
{123}{}{I was thinking about giving you some money, but since I don't have any... All I can offer you is a quick and painless death!}
#
{124}{}{Well... [Counting the money.] I didn't expect so much money but it'll do. You can go now... And never come back again!}
{125}{}{But what about...? Damn it. [Leave.]}
