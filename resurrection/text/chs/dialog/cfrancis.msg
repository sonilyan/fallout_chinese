#{1102}{}{I found a pack of smokes in the victim's house.}
{1102}{}{我在受害者家里发现了一包烟。}
#{1103}{}{Susan described the attacker as a man of average height, white skinned, not too muscular. He was wearing a green t-shirt and wore some kind of a vest over it. On his head he wore a cap.}
{1103}{}{苏珊形容袭击者身高一般，皮肤白皙，肌肉不太发达。他穿着一件绿色的t恤衫，还穿了一件背心。他头上戴着一顶瓶盖。}
#{1104}{}{I found a necklace made of human tongues at Chadwick's.}
{1104}{}{我在查德威克家发现了一条人类舌头做成的项链。}

#{1112}{}{I found a pack of smokes in the victim's house.}
{1112}{}{我在受害者家里发现了一包烟。}
#{1150}{}{That's interesting, but it won't help us much, yet. What else?}
{1150}{}{这很有趣，但对我们帮助不大。还有什么？}
#{1151}{}{I found a pack of smokes in the victim's house.}
{1151}{}{我在受害者家里发现了一包烟。}
#{1152}{}{Susan described the attacker as a man of average height, white skinned, not too muscular. He was wearing a green t-shirt and wore some kind of a vest over it. On his head he wore a cap.}
{1152}{}{苏珊形容袭击者身高一般，皮肤白皙，肌肉不太发达。他穿着一件绿色的t恤衫，还穿了一件背心。他头上戴着一顶瓶盖。}
#{1153}{}{Nothing yet.}
{1153}{}{还没有。}
#{1200}{}{Hmm, the victim didn't smoke, so the murderer must have lost it there. The only thing that we learn from that is, however, that the murderer is probably not a miner. They can't even afford cigarettes. Anything else?}
{1200}{}{嗯，受害者不抽烟，所以凶手一定是把烟弄丢了。然而，我们从中学到的唯一一件事是，凶手可能不是矿工。他们连烟都买不起。还有别的吗？}
#{1201}{}{Doctor Linsday said that the murderer is using a very unusual blade, one like he's never seen before.}

{1252}{}{我在受害者家里发现了一包烟。}
#{1253}{}{Nothing yet.}
{1253}{}{还没有。}
#{1300}{}{When I put it all together, I can think of one name - Chadwick. The description fits, he smoke cigarettes that he buys from the caravans and he could obtain some peculiar knife the same way. No one else fits the description better. But it's not enough. If we nab him and it turns out it wasn't him, the murderer will be more careful next time. I need you to get a confession out of Chadwick, or some evidence.}
{1300}{}{当我把这一切放在一起，我能想到一个名字-查德威克。他抽着从商队买来的香烟，用同样的方法也能弄到一把奇特的刀。没有比这更符合描述的了。但这还不够。如果我们抓住他，结果发现不是他，凶手下次会更小心。我需要你从查德威克那里得到一份供词，或者一些证据。}
#{1301}{}{Why me?}
{1301}{}{为什么是我？}
#{1350}{}{A policeman sniffing around would just alarm him and find nothing. You have a better chance. The 250 caps are already yours. [He gives them to you.] Help me convict him and you will get twice as much on top. Chadwick lives across the street.}
{1350}{}{一个警察四处嗅来嗅去，只会吓到他，什么也找不到。你有更好的机会。那250顶瓶盖已经是你的了。[他给你的]帮我把他定罪，你会得到双倍的好处。查德威克住在街对面。}
#{1351}{}{I'll see what can be done.}
{1351}{}{我看看能做些什么。}
#{1400}{}{[Sheriff takes the necklace in his hands and examines it.] This is sufficient proof. I'll take care of the rest. You deserve the 500 caps. [He gives them to you.] Well done.}
{1400}{}{[治安官把项链拿在手里检查了一下]这是充分的证据。剩下的我来处理。你应该得到500个瓶盖。[他给你的]干得好。}
#{1401}{}{Is there any more work for me?}

#{1402}{}{What will happen to him?}
{1402}{}{他会怎么样？}
#{1403}{}{Thanks.}
{1403}{}{谢谢。}
#{1450}{}{No. The town is peaceful, as it should be.}
{1450}{}{不，这座城市应该是和平的。}
#{1451}{}{What will happen to Chadwick?}
{1451}{}{查德威克会怎么样？}
#{1452}{}{OK.}
{1452}{}{好 啊。}
#{1500}{}{Chadwick came here and bragged about that necklace of his. That's a good enough confession in my book. I know I owe it to you, you earned the 500 caps. [He gives them to you.] Well done.}
{1500}{}{查德威克来到这里吹嘘他的项链。在我的书里这是一个很好的忏悔。我知道我欠你的，你赢得了500个瓶盖。[他给你的]干得好。}

#{1502}{}{What will happen to him?}
{1502}{}{他会怎么样？}
#{1503}{}{Thanks.}
{1503}{}{谢谢。}
#{1550}{}{Doctor Linsday already compared Chadwick's knife with the wounds of the victim and they match. Well done, you earned the 500 caps [He gives them to you.] and you can pick up Chadwick's knife at Linsday's, if you want. It belongs to you by the Law.}
{1550}{}{林斯戴医生已经把查德威克的刀和受害者的伤口进行了比对，结果吻合。干得好，你赢得了500顶瓶盖[他给你的]。如果你愿意，你可以在林斯戴那里拿查德威克的刀。法律上它属于你。}
#{1551}{}{Bloody hell, isn't the ring supposed to be about unarmed combat?!}

#{1602}{}{OK.}

{1651}{}{就这些？你不打算做点什么吗？}
#{1652}{}{OK.}

{1700}{}{我能做什么？查德威克可以在任何地方。这不再是科拉斯的问题了。如果他再出现，我们会处理他的。}
#{1701}{}{If you say so.}
{1701}{}{如果你这样说。}
#{1750}{}{Yes, it is supposed to be. I will personally kick the ass of the guy who searched Chadwick so carelessly. But the Law is clear - two enter, one comes out. And that has to be abided to. No exceptions.}
{1750}{}{是的，应该是。我个人会狠狠揍那个不小心搜查查德威克的家伙。但法律是明确的――两个进来，一个出来。这是必须遵守的。没有例外。}

{1852}{}{他会怎么样？}
#{1853}{}{Thanks, that's all I needed.}
{1853}{}{谢谢，这就是我所需要的。}
#{1900}{}{Why would they take good workforce out of the mine, unless he was causing trouble? Besides, Richie had his chance to disagree and fight for his truth in the ring, just like anyone else.}
{1900}{}{为什么他们要把优秀的劳动力从矿井里带走，除非他制造麻烦？除此之外，里奇也有机会和其他人一样，在拳击场上提出不同意见，为自己的真理而战。}
#{1901}{}{And wouldn't he be facing Blaster in that case?}
{1901}{}{如果那样的话，他不会面对爆炸机吗？}

{2050}{}{我还没决定。我会找出他造成了什么样的麻烦，并以此为基础，他要么在这里呆很长时间，要么我们处决他。}
#{2051}{}{And the word of Nestor's people is enough to lock him up?}
{2051}{}{内斯特手下的人说的话足以把他关起来？}
#{2052}{}{Could you release him? He didn't really do anything, it was a misunderstanding. And now the miners are starting to rebel because of it and Nestor wants him back to calm them down again.}

#{2250}{}{OK, tell Gordon to set him loose. And you can tell Nestor that he should train his stooges properly.}
{2250}{}{好吧，告诉戈登放他走。你可以告诉内斯特他应该好好训练他的走狗。}
#{2251}{}{Thanks and see you.}
{2251}{}{谢谢，再见。}
#{2300}{}{We were putting matters back in order. Nestor apparently can't handle it by himself. There was no reasonable discussion to be had with the miners. I have no idea what they thought they're going to achieve.}
{2300}{}{我们把事情重新安排好了。内斯特显然不能独自处理。与矿工们没有进行合理的讨论。我不知道他们认为他们会取得什么成就。}
#{2301}{}{But to shoot them all?!}
{2301}{}{但要把他们都杀了？！}
#{2302}{}{I see.}
{2302}{}{我懂了。}
#{2350}{}{It is our task to maintain order in Corath. We do everything that is necessary in this regard. And we aren't interested in your opinion.}
{2350}{}{我们的任务是维持科拉斯的秩序。我们在这方面做了一切必要的工作。我们对你的意见不感兴趣。}
#{2351}{}{I see.}
{2351}{}{我懂了。}
#{2400}{}{Hmm, Nestor's subduer. I'm the local sheriff. I have no time to waste with you.}
{2400}{}{嗯，内斯特的制服。我是当地的治安官。我没有时间和你浪费。}
#{2401}{}{Why did you lock up some of Nestor's men?}
{2401}{}{你为什么把内斯特的人关起来？}
#{2402}{}{Can you tell me about the laws that are in effect here?}
{2402}{}{你能告诉我这里的现行法律吗？}
#{2403}{}{Can I join the police force?}
{2403}{}{我能加入警察部队吗？}
#{2404}{}{I'll leave you to your work, goodbye.}
{2404}{}{我让你继续工作，再见。}
#{2450}{}{Hmm, Nestor's subduer. As I said already, I have no time to waste. That much is still true.}
{2450}{}{嗯，内斯特的制服。我已经说过了，我没有时间浪费了。这仍然是事实。}
#{2451}{}{Why did you lock up some of Nestor's men?}
{2451}{}{你为什么把内斯特的人关起来？}
#{2452}{}{Can you tell me about the laws that are in effect here?}
{2452}{}{你能告诉我这里的现行法律吗？}
#{2453}{}{Can I join the police force?}
{2453}{}{我能加入警察部队吗？}
#{2454}{}{Tell me about those errands. Maybe I'm interested after all.}
{2454}{}{告诉我那些差事。也许我还是感兴趣。}
#{2455}{}{I'll leave you to your work, goodbye.}
{2455}{}{我让你继续工作，再见。}
#{2500}{}{They are suspected of being involved in Richie's murder and of being unable to maintain proper order in the mine, which we had to deal with ourselves. And you heard it yourself that Nestor won't give up so easily. With all his men, he would be in good position to return soon and perhaps even start a war around here.}
{2500}{}{他们被怀疑与里奇的谋杀案有关，而且无法维持矿井的正常秩序，我们不得不自己处理。你自己也听说过内斯特不会轻易放弃的。有了所有的人，他很有可能很快就会回来，甚至可能在这里发动一场战争。}
#{2501}{}{I see.}
{2501}{}{我懂了。}
#{2550}{}{Hmm, Uncle's subduer. I am the local sheriff, I have no time to waste.}
{2550}{}{嗯，叔叔的制服。我是当地的治安官，我没有时间浪费。}
#{2551}{}{How is it possible that Ademar could take part in the attack against Uncle?}
{2551}{}{阿德玛怎么可能参与攻击叔叔？}
#{2552}{}{Can you tell me about Corath's laws?}
{2552}{}{你能告诉我科拉斯定律吗？}
#{2553}{}{Can I join the police force?}
{2553}{}{我能加入警察部队吗？}
#{2554}{}{I'll leave you to your work, goodbye.}
{2554}{}{我让你继续工作，再见。}
#{2600}{}{Hmm, Uncle's subduer. As I said already, I have no time to waste. That much is still true.}

#{2605}{}{I'll leave you to your work, goodbye.}
{2605}{}{我让你继续工作，再见。}
#{2650}{}{Uncle was inciting rebellion in the mine and he lost the duel in the ring. The Law is clear, but Uncle refused to surrender to it. He preferred to barricade himself in the house, with his people. We needed every capable man willing to fight, in order to restore order. Otherwise the whole town might have turned into a war zone.}
{2650}{}{叔叔在矿井里煽动叛乱，他在拳击场上输了。法律是明确的，但叔叔拒绝向它投降。他宁愿把自己关在房子里，和他的人在一起。为了恢复秩序，我们需要每个有能力的人都愿意战斗。否则整个城镇可能会变成一个战区。}
#{2651}{}{I see.}
{2651}{}{我懂了。}
#{2700}{}{This will do, you can continue on your own. Go wherever you like, but I don't want to see you in Corath ever again.}
{2700}{}{这样就可以了，你可以自己继续。去你想去的地方，但我不想再在科拉斯见到你。}
#{2701}{}{Why exactly are you banishing me?! Because my deputy lost in the ring?}
{2701}{}{你为什么要放逐我？！因为我的副手在拳击场上输了？}
#{2750}{}{I don't care what the Law says. My task is to maintain order in the town. Uncle and Nestor cause enough trouble on their own. I don't need another troublemaker in Corath, especially one so willing to help them at it.}
{2750}{}{我不管法律怎么说。我的任务是维持镇上的秩序。叔叔和内斯特一个人惹的麻烦已经够多了。我不需要在科拉斯再找麻烦制造者，尤其是一个如此愿意帮助他们的人。}
#{2751}{}{I don't care what the Law says. My task is to maintain order in the town. Uncle and Nestor cause enough trouble on their own. I don't need another troublemaker in Corath, especially one so willing to help them at it.}
{2751}{}{我不管法律怎么说。我的任务是维持镇上的秩序。叔叔和内斯特一个人惹的麻烦已经够多了。我不需要在科拉斯再找麻烦制造者，尤其是一个如此愿意帮助他们的人。}
#{2752}{}{As you wish, sheriff.}
{2752}{}{如你所愿，警长。}
#{2753}{}{And what if I don't wish to leave Corath?}
{2753}{}{如果我不想离开科拉斯呢？}
#{2800}{}{Then I will resolve the matter right here, right now, if you insist.}
{2800}{}{如果你坚持的话，那我现在就在这里解决这个问题。}
#{2801}{}{That won't be necessary. I'll do what you ask.}
{2801}{}{那没必要。我会照你说的做。}
#{2802}{}{Yeah? Come on, show me what you got!}
{2802}{}{是 啊？快点，让我看看你有什么！}
#{2850}{}{Look around the house of that last victim to see, if you can find some clues. It is in Uncle's Yard. Also, stop by at doctor Linsday's to hear what he found out by examining the body. His place is right above the ring. You should also talk to Susan, the whore who survived. Let her describe the attacker. Wanda's brothel is in the Iron District.}
{2850}{}{看看最后一个受害者的房子，如果你能找到线索的话。它在叔叔的院子里。另外，去林斯戴医生那里看看他通过检查尸体发现了什么。他的位置就在戒指的正上方。你也应该和苏珊谈谈，那个幸存下来的妓女。让她描述袭击者。万达的妓院在铁区。}
#{2851}{}{OK, thanks.}
{2851}{}{好的，谢谢。}
