{199}{}{菲尔顿需要更多的权力所以市长助理把这个数据光盘发给你。。。 -- Philton needs more power so the mayor's assistant send you this data disc...}
### {200}{}{Let me see... [Looks worried.] Hm, you know this is just too much. I believe, the plant could support such an enormous increase of power output, but that's just theoretical. My engineers would have to roll up their sleeves and do some serious calculations and refitting...}
{200}{}{让我看看。。。[看起来很担心。]嗯，你知道这太过分了。我相信，该工厂可以支持如此巨大的电力输出增长，但这只是理论上的。我的工程师们将不得不卷起袖子，进行一些认真的计算和改装。。。 -- Let me see... [Looks worried.] Hm, you know this is just too much. I believe, the plant could support such an enormous increase of power output, but that's just theoretical.

{203}{}{好吧，我能以某种方式帮助优化工厂以获得他们需要的额外电力吗？ -- Well, can I somehow help to optimize the plant to get that extra power they need?}
### {204}{}{Hey, begging won't solve anything. That would put us in risk of damaging the main reactor or even worse. You better step back and let me do my job, alright? The disc stays here so I can analyze the data in more detail and tell them personally about my decision. Now, if you may... there's the door.}
{204}{}{嘿，乞讨解决不了任何问题。这将使我们面临损坏主反应堆甚至更糟的风险。你最好退后一步，让我做好我的工作，好吗？光盘放在这里，这样我就可以更详细地分析数据，并亲自告诉他们我的决定。现在，如果你可以的话…那是门。 -- Hey, begging won't solve anything.

### {207}{}{[Smiles.] Haha, if you really want to help, you are most certainly welcome. Let me put it this way, that amount of energy would require some major repairs to be made and that isn't cheap. My estimation tells me that we're talking about roughly $15.000 for the parts. So, is this too much or am I mad?}
{207}{}{[微笑]哈哈，如果你真的想帮忙，我们当然欢迎你。让我这样说吧，那么多的能源需要进行一些大修，而且这并不便宜。我的估计告诉我，我们正在讨论大约15000美元的零件。那么，这是太过分了还是我疯了？ -- [Smiles.] Haha, if you really want to help, you are most certainly welcome.

{210}{}{（我可能会后悔，但是……）我把钱给你，你闭嘴怎么样？ -- (I might regret this but...) How about I give you the money and you shut up?}
### {211}{}{Hm, that's not a bad idea. If you can get me nine 40-hp motors, for the cooling mechanism and the utility crane, you'll save the day. That should be enough to start repairs. I'm going back to my work now, see you later then.}
{211}{}{嗯，这不是个坏主意。如果你能给我买九台40马力的电机，用于冷却机构和通用起重机，你就能省下一天的时间。这应该足够开始维修了。我现在要回去工作，待会儿见。 -- Hm, that's not a bad idea.

### {234}{}{I think you're overreacting about the whole thing. Of course people are worried, but clearly not because of something that may happen decades or more from now.

{234}{}{我认为你对整件事反应过度了。人们当然担心，但显然不是因为几十年或更长时间后可能发生的事情。更紧迫的事情才是我们真正需要担心的，你不同意吗？[叹气。]此外，让你四处窥探可能会造成比问题本身更大的损害。你觉得自己很幸运，我只是取消了你进入地下的权限。门在那儿！ -- I think you're overreacting about the whole thing.
