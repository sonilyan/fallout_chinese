{116}{}{噢，我有话要跟他说，混蛋，只是你不在身边。现在他妈的给我让开。}

#{120}{}{Oh yeah, *asshole*? What are you going to do, kneel down and pray at me? [he pulls aside his jacket to reveal a pistol] Yeah, that's right. You and your boy don't belong in Reno. Now get your ass out of my way, before I reach down your throat, pull out your guts, and hang you with them.}
{120}{}{哦，是的，混蛋？你要做什么，跪下来向我祈祷？[他拉开夹克露出手枪]是的，没错。你和你儿子不属于雷诺。别挡我的路，趁我还没够到你的喉咙，把你的肠子掏出来，把你和他们一起吊死。}
#{121}{}{Now I'm going to take that gun from you and march you into the desert. Every time you slow down, I'm going to put a bullet in your body part, somewhere, that won't kill you. Just enough to hurt you bad enough to get you marching again. You're going to walk further than you ever walked in your life, because when you finally stop and you *can't* move any more, that's when I'm going to put a bullet in your head and walk back. No one here will even notice we're gone. In fact, I bet no one in the city will ever miss you. What do you think?}
{121}{}{现在我要把你的枪拿走，带你去沙漠。每次你慢下来，我都会在你身体的某个地方放一颗子弹，那不会杀了你。足以伤害你，让你再次行军。你会走得比你一生中走得更远，因为当你最终停下来，你再也不能动了，那时候我会用子弹打你的头，然后走回去。没人会注意到我们走了。事实上，我敢打赌城里没有人会想念你的。你怎么认为？}
#{122}{}{You say violent things. I do violent things. Last warning - this is your chance to leave.}
{122}{}{你说暴力的话。我做暴力的事。最后警告-这是你离开的机会。}

{1116}{}{哦，我有话要对他说，婊子，只是你不在身边。现在他妈的给我让开。}

{1120}{}{哦，是吗，婊子？你要做什么，跪下来向我祈祷？[他拉开夹克露出手枪]是的，没错。你和你儿子不属于雷诺。别挡我的路，趁我还没够到你的喉咙，把你的肠子掏出来，把你和他们一起吊死。}
#{1123}{}{[He hesitates for a second, watching you, then steps back] You'd better hope I never catch you in a dark alley, bitch! [he gives you the middle finger and turns away]}
{1123}{}{[他犹豫了一下，看着你，然后退后一步]你最好希望我永远不会在黑暗的巷子里抓住你，婊子！[他给了你中指然后转身离开]}
