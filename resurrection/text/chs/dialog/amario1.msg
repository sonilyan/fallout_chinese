#{400}{}{Aargh, that hurts! And I thought we were friends.}
{400}{}{啊，好痛！我以为我们是朋友。}
#{500}{}{I don't know you. Why are you bothering me? Did you come to see my idiotic parents? They're home, just so they could yell at me the whole day.}

#{504}{}{Ee, ech... Bleh.}

#{602}{}{I'll leave you be. Bye.}
{602}{}{我会离开你的。再见。}
#{650}{}{They want to send me into the army. My old man came up with that crap, said it'd be great career. Bah. And my mother won't help me. Says that it'll make me stop doing mischief like I did last month. What a load of shit! Isn't it enough that I'm grounded because of that?}
{650}{}{他们想把我送进军队。我老爸想出了那个废话，说这会是一个伟大的事业。呸。我妈妈不会帮我的。说这会让我不再像上个月那样胡闹。真是一派胡言！我因此被禁足还不够吗？}

{654}{}{杀了他们。}
#{655}{}{I'll leave you be. Bye.}
{655}{}{我会离开你的。再见。}
#{700}{}{Stupid imperial army accepts recruits of my age. It's because they need someone to boss around so they could feel better about themselves. I know a few boys and even one girl who were sent there. Now they're mindless zombies. My dumbass parents probably just want to get rid of me, want me to get killed by some disgusting mutants or a braindead tribal.}
{700}{}{愚蠢的帝国军队接受我这个年纪的新兵。这是因为他们需要有人来领导，这样他们才能对自己感觉更好。我认识几个男孩，甚至一个女孩被派到那里。现在他们是无意识的僵尸。我愚蠢的父母可能只是想摆脱我，想让我被一些恶心的变种人或脑死部落杀死。}

I hope they die...}
{750}{}{我以前的朋友不相信我说我可以在他们不注意的情况下扒他们的口袋。所以我给他们看了。当他们发现少了一些东西时，大惊小怪地告诉他们的父母是我抢的。该死的爱哭的孩子。妈妈开始疯狂地尖叫，爸爸把我揍了一顿。我希望他们死。。。}

#{850}{}{Yeah, I could kick the shit out of every idiot that pisses me off. That's true. I didn't think of that. And I won't have to stay with my annoying parents. They just keep me locked in here and preach their crap to me. The army can't be any worse.}
{850}{}{是啊，我可以把所有惹我生气的白痴都踢出去。那是真的。我没想到。我就不用和我讨厌的父母呆在一起了。他们只是把我关在这里跟我说他们的废话。军队再糟糕不过了。}

{851}{}{给你。祝你新生活好运。}
#{900}{}{Hehe... What? Are you serious?}
{900}{}{呵呵。。。什么？你是认真的吗？}
#{901}{}{Are you going to just let them keep pissing you off? Let them destroy your life, never let you do anything fun, and in the end, send you into the army or somewhere where you'll just get killed? You've no other choice, it's practically self-defense.}

#{2000}{}{Cool. [He takes the cigarettes, then pulls out a syringe and a few pills.] The guys were laughing when I told them what disease you have, but in the end, they told me what to do about it.
