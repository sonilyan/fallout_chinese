{250}{}{你看朱利安，南边的统治者。}
#{300}{}{Natalia, check the status of our supplies.}
{300}{}{娜塔莉亚，检查我们的补给状况。}
#{301}{}{I should discard that faulty lot of armor piercing rounds.}
{301}{}{我应该扔掉那些有缺陷的穿甲弹。}
#{350}{}{When I'm done with you, you'll wish you were never born!}
{350}{}{当我和你在一起的时候，你会希望你从未出生！}
#{351}{}{When I'm done with you, you'll wish you were never born!}
{351}{}{当我和你在一起的时候，你会希望你从未出生！}
#{352}{}{Die!}
{352}{}{去死吧！}
#{353}{}{Scurry away, loony, before I change my mind!}
{353}{}{在我改变主意之前赶紧离开，疯子！}
#{354}{}{We're coming for you, bitch!}
{354}{}{我们来找你，婊子！}
#{355}{}{Go to cellar and find Leonard!}
{355}{}{去地下室找莱纳德！}
#{356}{}{Go away, chickenshit! You're not worth a bullet to me.}
{356}{}{走开，胆小鬼！你对我来说不值一颗子弹。}
#{357}{}{Don't rummage through my stuff. If you need anything, talk to me.}
{357}{}{别翻我的东西。如果你需要什么，跟我说。}
#{400}{}{There you go, you bastard!}
{400}{}{给你，混蛋！}
#{500}{}{Who the hell are you? I've never seen you here before. Did Leonard send you?! Remember, nobody'll get Julian alive!}
{500}{}{你到底是谁？我从没在这里见过你。伦纳德派你来的？！记住，没人能让朱利安活着！}
#{501}{}{Easy there. Trevor said you might have a job for me.}
{501}{}{别紧张。特雷弗说你可能有工作给我。}
#{502}{}{Nope, I don't even know that guy. I just want to trade with you.}
{502}{}{不，我甚至不认识那个人。我只想和你交易。}
#{503}{}{Take it easy. There's a "Guns" sign on the front of this building, so I came to buy some.}
{503}{}{别紧张。这栋楼前面有个“枪”的牌子，所以我来买了一些。}
#{504}{}{Take it easy. There's a "Guns" sign on the front of this building, so I came to buy some.}
{504}{}{别紧张。这栋楼前面有个“枪”的牌子，所以我来买了一些。}
#{505}{}{Well, I'll be on my way then.}
{505}{}{好吧，那我就上路了。}
#{506}{}{Aeuu.}
{506}{}{再见。}
#{550}{}{You again? What do you want from me again?}
{550}{}{又是你？你又想从我这里得到什么？}
#{551}{}{Hi, how can I help you?}
{551}{}{嗨，有什么事吗？}
#{552}{}{About that job...}
{552}{}{关于那份工作。。。}
#{553}{}{Can I ask you something?}
{553}{}{我能问你件事吗？}
#{554}{}{I need to buy some stuff.}
{554}{}{我需要买些东西。}
#{555}{}{Do you have some work for me?}
{555}{}{你有工作给我吗？}
#{556}{}{I know who killed Maria!}
{556}{}{我知道谁杀了玛丽亚！}
#{557}{}{Never mind, I'll be on my way.}
{557}{}{没关系，我马上就来。}
#{558}{}{Ah, my favorite trooper. I knew you'd be back. So what's the matter?}
{558}{}{啊，我最喜欢的骑兵。我就知道你会回来的。怎么了？}
#{559}{}{Hi! Glad to see you again. What can I do for you?}
{559}{}{你好！很高兴再次见到你。有什么事吗？}
#{560}{}{Now that you have your supplies, will you help me with Alexa?}
{560}{}{既然你有了生活用品，你能帮我照看亚历克莎吗？}
#{600}{}{He really said that? [He gives you an inquisitive look.] I don't employ every wimp who comes around. But since you're here, I might have something for you. Something that could be really dangerous. Are you up for it?}
{600}{}{他真的这么说？[他好奇地看了你一眼]我不会雇佣每一个过来的懦夫。但既然你来了，我可能有东西给你。一些非常危险的事情。你准备好了吗？}
#{601}{}{You won't discourage me that easily. Tell me.}
{601}{}{你不会那么容易让我泄气的。告诉我。}
#{602}{}{Eh... Not really, no.}
{602}{}{呃。。。不是真的，不是。}
#{603}{}{He really said that? [He gives you an inquisitive look.] I don't employ every wimp who comes around. But since you're here, I might have something for you. Something that could be really dangerous. Are you up for it?}
{603}{}{他真的这么说？[他好奇地看了你一眼]我不会雇佣每一个过来的懦夫。但既然你来了，我可能有东西给你。一些非常危险的事情。你准备好了吗？}
#{650}{}{Fine. It's about medical supplies. Moore, our doctor, has barely enough to take care of the most urgent cases. Leonard's next offensive could, in the worst case, end in loads of my men kicking the bucket because of the lack of medical stuff. It's essential to replenish our supplies. From now on, it's your task. My assistant Natalia will tell you what exactly we need.}
{650}{}{好的。是关于医疗用品的。我们的医生摩尔几乎没有足够的钱来处理最紧急的病例。在最坏的情况下，伦纳德的下一次进攻可能会以我的人因为缺乏医疗用品而被踢出水桶而告终。补充我们的供给是必要的。从现在起，这是你的任务。我的助手娜塔莉亚会告诉你我们到底需要什么。}
#{652}{}{As you wish. See you later, Julian.}
{652}{}{如你所愿。再见，朱利安。}
#{700}{}{Hey guys! We have a retard to shoot here! Run, loony, we'll give you a head start! Boo!}
{700}{}{嘿，伙计们！我们这里有个笨蛋要开枪！快跑，疯子，我们会让你先发制人的！喝倒采！}
#{701}{}{Aaaah!}
{701}{}{啊啊！}
#{702}{}{Nooo! Want trade. Having caps.}
{702}{}{不！想要交易。有瓶盖的。}
#{750}{}{Okay, I have this...}
{750}{}{好吧，我有这个。。。}
#{751}{}{[Trade.]}
{751}{}{[贸易]}
#{800}{}{Something else?}
{800}{}{还有别的吗？}
#{801}{}{Yep, I forgot something.}
{801}{}{是的，我忘了什么。}
#{802}{}{Yep, I forgot something.}
{802}{}{是的，我忘了什么。}
#{803}{}{I need something that has nothing to do with trading.}
{803}{}{我需要一些与交易无关的东西。}
#{804}{}{Thanks, that's all. See ya later.}
{804}{}{谢谢，就这些。再见。}
#{850}{}{Why the hell for? Do you think I've time just to answer your stupid questions? So get on with it, I don't intend spending an entire day just talking to you.}
{850}{}{他妈的为什么？你以为我有时间回答你那些愚蠢的问题吗？所以继续吧，我不打算花一整天的时间和你说话。}
#{851}{}{Tell me something about yourself.}
{851}{}{跟我说说你自己。}
#{852}{}{What can you tell me about this town?}
{852}{}{关于这个城市你能告诉我什么？}
#{853}{}{How's the trade?}
{853}{}{生意怎么样？}
#{854}{}{I would like to know about your relationship with Maria.}
{854}{}{我想知道你和玛丽亚的关系。}
#{855}{}{Have you ever seen such a talisman? [Show it to him.]}
{855}{}{你见过这样的护身符吗？[给他看。]}
#{856}{}{Why do you fight with Leonard?}
{856}{}{你为什么和伦纳德打架？}
#{857}{}{Actually I need something else.}
{857}{}{其实我还需要别的东西。}
#{858}{}{Of course, ask away.}
{858}{}{当然，请离开。}
#{860}{}{Who's that Alexa anyway?}
{860}{}{那Alexa是谁？}
#{862}{}{I need to know something more about Maria.}
{862}{}{我需要更多地了解玛丽亚。}
#{863}{}{Have you ever seen such a talisman? [Describe the talisman.]}
{863}{}{你见过这样的护身符吗？[描述护身符。]}
#{900}{}{I'm the boss of the South Side and I wage a war with those cunts from the North. You don't need to know anything more.}
{900}{}{我是南方的老大，我和北方的女人开战。你不需要知道更多。}
#{901}{}{As you wish. I need to know something else.}
{901}{}{如你所愿。我需要知道些别的。}
#{902}{}{Ah. Can I ask you something else?}
{902}{}{啊。我能问你点别的吗？}
#{950}{}{Miserably. The war isolated the entire town and turned the locals into beggars. There aren't many who can afford my weapons. And it'll only get worse.}
{950}{}{悲惨地。战争孤立了整个城镇，把当地人变成了乞丐。没有多少人买得起我的武器。只会变得更糟。}
#{951}{}{So why are you staying here?}
{951}{}{那你为什么留在这里？}
#{952}{}{Weapons? I'd like to buy some then.}
{952}{}{武器？那我想买一些。}
#{953}{}{Back to the questions. I have some more.}
{953}{}{回到问题上来。我还有一些。}
#{954}{}{I need something else from you.}
{954}{}{我需要你给我点别的东西。}
#{1000}{}{Fine, but be quick with it. You're robbing me of my time.}
{1000}{}{好吧，但要快点。你在抢我的时间。}
#{1001}{}{About that work...}
{1001}{}{关于那个工作。。。}
#{1002}{}{Can I ask you something?}
{1002}{}{我能问你件事吗？}
#{1003}{}{I need to buy some stuff.}

#{1004}{}{Do you have any work for me?}
{1004}{}{你有工作给我吗？}
#{1005}{}{I know who killed Maria!}
{1005}{}{我知道谁杀了玛丽亚！}
#{1006}{}{Nothing actually. I'll be on my way.}
{1006}{}{实际上什么都没有。我马上就来。}
#{1050}{}{Tough luck. I haven't.}
{1050}{}{真倒霉。我没有。}
#{1051}{}{Do you know anyone who might recognize it?}
{1051}{}{你认识谁能认出它来吗？}
#{1052}{}{Ah. I'd like to ask something else.}
{1052}{}{啊。我想问别的问题。}
#{1053}{}{Oh well. I need something else then.}
{1053}{}{哦，好吧。那我还需要别的东西。}
#{1100}{}{Nobody like that here. People have too many problems to be interested in such worthless junk. But ask around in Sedit, it's a big caravan town far away from here. A lot of people from various areas of the wasteland live there. There, you'll have a bigger chance of meeting someone who knows this useless stuff.}
{1100}{}{这里没人喜欢这样。人们有太多的问题，对这种毫无价值的垃圾不感兴趣。但在塞迪特问问，这是一个大篷车镇离这里很远。许多来自荒地不同地区的人住在那里。在那里，你会有更大的机会遇到一个知道这些无用的东西的人。}
#{1101}{}{Sedit? Where is it?}
{1101}{}{塞迪特？它在哪里？}
#{1102}{}{Thanks. I have another question.}
{1102}{}{谢谢。我还有一个问题。}
#{1103}{}{Maybe. I need something else from you.}
{1103}{}{也许 吧。我需要你给我点别的东西。}
#{1150}{}{You'll find the town right here. [He marks the location in your map.]}
{1150}{}{你会在这里找到这个城镇的。[他在你的地图上标出了位置。]}
#{1151}{}{Thanks. I want to ask you something else.}
{1151}{}{谢谢。我想问你点别的。}
#{1152}{}{That'll help. Now I need something else from you.}
{1152}{}{那会有帮助的。现在我需要你给我点别的。}
#{1200}{}{What, you don't know? That changes the situation a bit. I'll tell you but not for free. You'll give me... let's say 50 caps.}
{1200}{}{什么，你不知道？这稍微改变了一下情况。我告诉你，但不是免费的。你会给我。。。假设50个。}
#{1201}{}{Okay, sounds fair. [Give him 50 caps.]}
{1201}{}{好吧，听起来很公平。[给他50个瓶盖]}
#{1202}{}{That's too much. I can give you 20.}
{1202}{}{太过分了。我可以给你20英镑。}
#{1203}{}{Forget about it. I want to ask something else.}
{1203}{}{算了吧。我想问点别的。}
#{1204}{}{Maybe later. I need something else now.}
{1204}{}{也许以后吧。我现在需要别的东西。}
#{1250}{}{Okay then, pay up.}
{1250}{}{好吧，那就付钱吧。}
#{1251}{}{[Pay 20 caps.]}
{1251}{}{[支付20个上限。]}
#{1252}{}{You know, it's still too much. I'd rather ask you something else.}
{1252}{}{你知道，还是太多了。我倒想问你点别的。}
#{1253}{}{Actually I need something else.}
{1253}{}{其实我还需要别的东西。}
#{1300}{}{[He frowns.] What are you trying here?! I'm not going under 50 caps.}
{1300}{}{[他皱眉]你在这里干什么？！我不想低于50个上限。}
#{1301}{}{Oh well then. [Pay him.]}
{1301}{}{那好吧。[付钱给他。]}
#{1302}{}{I don't need to know it that much. I'd rather ask you something else.}
{1302}{}{我不需要知道那么多。我倒想问你点别的。}
#{1303}{}{Whatever. I need something else.}
{1303}{}{无论什么。我需要别的东西。}
#{1350}{}{What other option do I have? Run from battle? [He frowns.] No way! I have to see personally that son of a bitch Leonard gets what he deserves. I don't care about anything else anymore}
{1350}{}{我还有什么选择？从战场上逃跑？[他皱眉]不可能！我必须亲眼看到那个狗娘养的伦纳德得到了他应得的。我再也不在乎别的了}
#{1351}{}{What about your mercenaries? Do they share the same point of view?}
{1351}{}{你的佣兵呢？他们有相同的观点吗？}
#{1352}{}{Why? What has he done anyway?}
{1352}{}{为什么？他到底做了什么？}
#{1353}{}{Tell me more about that Leonard guy.}
{1353}{}{跟我说说那个叫伦纳德的家伙。}
#{1354}{}{It's your business. I want to ask something else.}
{1354}{}{这是你的事。我想问点别的。}
#{1400}{}{They just care about getting paid. Mostly, they are outcasts who would shoot anyone you point at for several caps. [He sighs lightly.] But they do that well. If I want to win this war, I can't do without them.}
{1400}{}{他们只关心薪水。大多数情况下，他们都是被放逐的人，他们会射杀任何你指向的人几次。[他轻轻地叹了口气]但他们做得很好。如果我想赢得这场战争，我离不开他们。}
#{1401}{}{I understand. I want to ask something else.}
{1401}{}{我理解。我想问点别的。}
#{1402}{}{Ah. I need something else from you.}
{1402}{}{啊。我需要你给我点别的东西。}
#{1650}{}{He killed Maria, the woman I loved. It's a fucked up story I have no intentions to talk about. If you're interested, go see George. It ruined that poor fellow's life. He'll surely open his heart to you for several caps.}
{1650}{}{他杀了玛丽亚，我爱的女人。这是一个糟糕的故事，我没有打算谈论。如果你有兴趣，去看看乔治。它毁了那个可怜的家伙的生活。他一定会向你敞开心扉的。}
#{1651}{}{Fine. I want to ask you something else.}
{1651}{}{好的。我想问你点别的。}
#{1652}{}{Maybe I'll do that. See ya.}
{1652}{}{也许我会这么做。再见。}
#{1653}{}{Who's this George, actually?}
{1653}{}{实际上，这位乔治是谁？}
#{1654}{}{Tell me more about Leonard.}
{1654}{}{告诉我更多关于伦纳德的事。}
#{1750}{}{He's a traitor and a fucking murderer. We used to run a profitable business, but he ruined everything. Because of pitiful jealousy, he sank to dirty murder and afterwards he even lacked the balls to admit it. Instead, he and his bitch Alexa declared war against me, as if it could save them. He's always been a chickenshit. And he'll die like a chickenshit. I'll see to that.}
{1750}{}{他是个叛徒，他妈的杀人犯。我们过去经营一个有利可图的生意，但他毁了一切。由于可怜的嫉妒，他陷入了肮脏的谋杀，后来他甚至连承认的勇气都没有。相反，他和他的婊子亚历克斯向我宣战，好像这可以拯救他们。他一直是个胆小鬼。他会像个胆小鬼一样死去。我会处理的。}
#{1751}{}{Alexa? Who's that?}
{1751}{}{亚历克斯？那是谁？}
#{1752}{}{What did Leonard actually do?}
{1752}{}{伦纳德到底做了什么？}
#{1754}{}{I want to ask you something else.}
{1754}{}{我想问你点别的。}
#{1800}{}{She's Leonard's main henchman. She's been working for him ever since I can remember. I've never liked that stupid bitch. As soon as I win this war, she'll pay for selling herself to that shitty motherfucker.}
{1800}{}{她是伦纳德的主要心腹。从我记事起她就一直在为他工作。我从没喜欢过那个愚蠢的婊子。一旦我赢了这场战争，她就会为把自己卖给那个混蛋付出代价。}
#{1803}{}{What did Leonard actually do?}
{1803}{}{伦纳德到底做了什么？}
#{1804}{}{I'd rather ask you something else.}
{1804}{}{我倒想问你点别的。}
#{2000}{}{What the fuck should I tell you about it? It's simply a place which went fucking downhill thanks to this waste of life called Leonard. If he hadn't been avoiding rightful punishment for what he had done, we could've avoided this neverending war. All those years of fighting ruined the town, but screw that! I won't stop till I get that bastard!}
{2000}{}{我他妈的该怎么跟你说？这只是一个地方，他妈的走下坡多亏了这种浪费生命所谓的伦纳德。如果他没有为自己的所作所为逃避应有的惩罚，我们本可以避免这场永无休止的战争。这么多年的战斗毁了这座城市，但去他妈的！在我抓住那个混蛋之前我不会罢休的！}
#{2001}{}{Tell me more about Leonard.}
{2001}{}{告诉我更多关于伦纳德的事。}
#{2002}{}{Ah. I'd like to ask about something else.}
{2002}{}{啊。我想问些别的事。}
#{2003}{}{Yep, okay. I need something else.}
{2003}{}{是的，好的。我需要别的东西。}
#{2250}{}{Why? Because that motherfucker needs to pay for what he did, that's why!}
{2250}{}{为什么？因为那个混蛋需要为他的所作所为付出代价，这就是为什么！}
#{2251}{}{What did he do anyway?}
{2251}{}{他到底做了什么？}
#{2252}{}{Tell me more about Leonard.}
{2252}{}{告诉我更多关于伦纳德的事。}
#{2253}{}{Ah. I'd like to ask about something else.}
{2253}{}{啊。我想问些别的事。}
#{2400}{}{[He stares you down suspiciously.] What's it the fuck to you?!}
{2400}{}{[他怀疑地盯着你]你他妈的怎么了？！}
#{2401}{}{I'm trying to shed some light on Maria's death and the more I know the better chance to succeed I have.}
{2401}{}{我正试图对玛丽亚的死有所了解，我知道的越多，成功的机会就越大。}
#{2402}{}{Nothing at all, actually. See ya.}
{2402}{}{实际上，什么都没有。再见。}
#{2450}{}{You need to know only one thing - Leonard killed Maria. No investigation is needed. Leave the past be or you'll get in unnecessary trouble.}
{2450}{}{你只需要知道一件事-伦纳德杀了玛丽亚。不需要调查。离开过去，否则你会惹上不必要的麻烦。}
#{2451}{}{The same way like you're leaving it be? No, I don't think so. I'll discover the truth whether you like it or not.}
{2451}{}{就像你要离开一样？不，我不这么认为。不管你喜不喜欢，我都会发现真相的。}
#{2452}{}{No can do. I managed to get some evidence that shed completely different light on the murder. I need to learn how it happened.}
{2452}{}{没有人能做到。我设法找到了一些证据，对谋杀案有完全不同的解释。我要知道事情是怎么发生的。}
#{2453}{}{Okay, forget it. I want to ask you something else.}
{2453}{}{好吧，算了吧。我想问你点别的。}
#{2500}{}{You'll learn fuck all anyway, but okay, I'll help you. What exactly do you want to know?}
{2500}{}{不管怎样你都会学到的，不过好吧，我会帮你的。你到底想知道什么？}
#{2501}{}{Tell me more about Maria.}
{2501}{}{告诉我更多关于玛丽亚的事。}
#{2502}{}{You and Maria were close to each other, right?}
{2502}{}{你和玛丽亚很亲近，对吧？}
#{2503}{}{What was the relationship between Maria and Leonard?}
{2503}{}{玛丽亚和伦纳德是什么关系？}
#{2504}{}{Do you know anyone else who would've wanted her dead?}
{2504}{}{你知道还有谁想让她死吗？}
#{2505}{}{Actually nothing else. I'll be on my way.}
{2505}{}{其实没有别的。我马上就来。}
#{2506}{}{What exactly do you want to know?}
{2506}{}{你到底想知道什么？}
#{2550}{}{I told you to let the murder be. What the fuck isn't clear about that?!}
{2550}{}{我告诉过你不要再杀人了。他妈的有什么不清楚的？！}
#{2551}{}{Nothing at all. See you.}
{2551}{}{什么都没有。再见。}
#{2600}{}{She was the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. She was driving people crazy for her. And some even hated her because of that. A lot of nasty, filthy rumors spread about her. But they were all made up! Maria wouldn't be able to do anything harmful to me.}
{2600}{}{她是我见过的最漂亮的女人。她让人们为她疯狂。有些人甚至因此恨她。很多关于她的肮脏的流言流传开来。但他们都是虚构的！玛丽亚不会做任何对我有害的事。}
#{2601}{}{I understand. I have another question regarding Maria.}
{2601}{}{我理解。我还有一个关于玛丽亚的问题。}
#{2650}{}{He's a former mayor. Maria was his daughter. When Leonard killed her, he broke down. Now, he's just a pitiful wreck. I let him beg in my part of the town so he wouldn't damn starve to death. But he won't last for much longer. Considering his current state, it will be deliverance for him.}
{2650}{}{他是前市长。玛丽亚是他的女儿。伦纳德杀了她，他崩溃了。现在，他只是个可怜的失败者。我让他在我的地盘乞讨，这样他才不会饿死。但他活不了多久了。考虑到他目前的状况，这将是对他的解脱。}
#{2651}{}{I'll talk to him. See ya, Julian.}
{2651}{}{我会和他谈谈。再见，朱利安。}
#{2652}{}{Ah. I'd like to ask about something else.}
{2652}{}{啊。我想问些别的事。}
#{2653}{}{I need something else from you.}
{2653}{}{我需要你给我点别的东西。}
#{2700}{}{I loved Maria. It was no infatuation, I really cared about her. And I know for sure she felt the same way about me. If Leonard hadn't tried to mess with her head, we would've been together. I'll never forgive myself for not being able to save her back then.}
{2700}{}{我爱玛丽亚。这不是痴迷，我真的很关心她。我确信她对我也有同样的感觉。如果莱纳德不想弄乱她的脑袋，我们早就在一起了。我永远不会原谅自己当时救不了她。}
#{2701}{}{No doubt about that. I have another question about Maria.}
{2701}{}{毫无疑问。我还有一个关于玛丽亚的问题。}
#{2750}{}{I know he was in too deep. He tried to get her by any means but she refused him. She wanted to be with me only. That slander about her seeing Leonard in secret was just a load of filthy lies. I've never believed them.}
{2750}{}{我知道他陷得太深了。他千方百计想抓住她，但她拒绝了。她只想和我在一起。关于她秘密见到伦纳德的诽谤只是一堆肮脏的谎言。我从不相信他们。}
#{2751}{}{Sure. I have another question about Maria.}
{2751}{}{当然。我还有一个关于玛丽亚的问题。}
#{2800}{}{You still don't understand that, do you? Leonard killed Maria because he couldn't cope with being refused. Nobody else could've done that!}
{2800}{}{你还是不明白，是吗？伦纳德杀了玛丽亚，因为他无法忍受被拒绝。没人会那么做！}
#{2801}{}{Sure. I have another question about Maria.}
{2801}{}{当然。我还有一个关于玛丽亚的问题。}
#{2850}{}{What exactly do you want to know?}

#{3050}{}{Nope, I don't have anything else for you.}
{3050}{}{不，我没有别的东西给你。}
#{3051}{}{No, I have this weird feeling about you. I have nothing for you.}
{3051}{}{不，我对你有种奇怪的感觉。我没有东西给你。}
#{3052}{}{Ah, okay. So then I'd like to talk about something else.}
{3052}{}{啊，好吧。所以我想谈点别的。}
#{3100}{}{Yeah, I have something else for you. I hope you have some experience with a protection racket, because it'll come in handy. Natalia will tell you more.}
{3100}{}{是的，我还有别的东西要给你。我希望你有一些使用防护球拍的经验，因为它会派上用场的。娜塔莉亚会告诉你更多的。}
#{3101}{}{Sure, boss. I'll talk to her.}
{3101}{}{当然，老板。我会和她谈谈。}
#{3102}{}{Damn, why do you have to keep passing me on to each other like a hot potato?}
{3102}{}{妈的，你为什么要把我像烫手山芋一样传给别人？}
#{3103}{}{I'll talk to her, but first, I need something else from you.}
{3103}{}{我会和她谈谈，但首先，我需要你给我点别的。}
#{3150}{}{Stop complaining. If you don't shut your trap, you won't stay alive much longer, believe me!}
{3150}{}{别抱怨了。如果你不关上你的陷阱，你就活不了多久了，相信我！}
#{3151}{}{Stop complaining. If you don't shut your trap, you won't stay alive much longer, believe me!}
{3151}{}{别抱怨了。如果你不关上你的陷阱，你就活不了多久了，相信我！}
#{3152}{}{Sorry, I'll be silent. I'll talk to Natalia at once.}
{3152}{}{对不起，我会保持沉默。我马上和娜塔莉亚谈谈。}
#{3153}{}{Sorry, I'll see her in a bit, but first I need something from you.}
{3153}{}{对不起，我一会儿见她，但首先我需要你的东西。}
#{3154}{}{Really? Prove it!}
{3154}{}{真正地？证明给我看！}
#{3200}{}{I hate cowards who are trying to make their fucking short lives longer. So, is there anything else that troubles you or are you gonna go wash those soiled pants of yours?}
{3200}{}{我讨厌胆小鬼，他们想让他们他妈的短暂的生命更长。那么，还有什么麻烦你的吗？还是你要去洗你的脏裤子？}
#{3201}{}{You're gonna regret that!}
{3201}{}{你会后悔的！}
#{3202}{}{I'll go for the second option. Sorry for disturbing you, sir.}
{3202}{}{我选择第二种。对不起打扰您了，先生。}
#{3250}{}{Well, what about it?}
{3250}{}{好吧，那怎么办？}
#{3251}{}{The doctor got the equipment he wanted.}
{3251}{}{医生得到了他想要的设备。}
#{3252}{}{I have the protection money from the bartender.}
{3252}{}{我有酒保给我的保护费。}
#{3253}{}{Actually nothing, forget about that. I'd like to ask you something else.}
{3253}{}{其实没什么，算了吧。我想问你别的问题。}
#{3254}{}{The doctor got all the equipment he wanted. The word is there's extra money in for me.}
{3254}{}{医生得到了他想要的所有设备。据说我有多余的钱。}
#{3300}{}{Great! Natalia will pay you. Go talk to her.}
{3300}{}{太好了！娜塔莉亚会付钱给你的。去和她谈谈。}
#{3301}{}{Sure thing, boss.}
{3301}{}{当然，老板。}
#{3302}{}{Great! You bet it is. Natalia will pay you extra in addition to your reward. Go talk to her.}
{3302}{}{太好了！当然是的。娜塔莉亚会给你额外的报酬。去和她谈谈。}
#{3350}{}{Great! How much did you beat out of him?}
{3350}{}{太好了！你打了他多少？}
#{3351}{}{Great! How much did you beat out of him?}
{3351}{}{太好了！你打了他多少？}
#{3352}{}{He gave me just 200 caps.}
{3352}{}{他只给了我200顶瓶盖。}
#{3353}{}{Here you go, 300 caps flat.}
{3353}{}{给你，300平。}
#{3354}{}{He had 450!}
{3354}{}{他有450个！}
#{3400}{}{Bullshit! That motherfucker has to have more on himself! Get back there and don't return with less than 300!}
{3400}{}{瞎扯！他妈的他自己要多点！回到那里，不要带着少于300的钱回来！}
#{3401}{}{But they'll shoot me on sight now!}
{3401}{}{但他们一看到我就开枪！}
#{3402}{}{Take it easy, I'm on my way.}
{3402}{}{别紧张，我马上就来。}
#{3450}{}{That's your problem, you're supposed to do your job properly. So don't whine now or else it'll be me who shoots you.}
{3450}{}{那是你的问题，你应该做好你的工作。所以现在别发牢骚了，要不然是我杀了你。}
#{3451}{}{Okay, I'm on my way.}
{3451}{}{好的，我这就去。}
#{3500}{}{That'll do. I'm satisfied with you, Natalia will pay you. Then come back, I have something else for you.}
{3500}{}{那就行了。我对你很满意，娜塔莉亚会付钱给你的。那回来吧，我还有别的东西给你。}
#{3501}{}{Of course, thanks.}
{3501}{}{当然，谢谢。}
#{3502}{}{That'll do. I'm satisfied with you, Natalia will pay you.}
{3502}{}{那就行了。我对你很满意，娜塔莉亚会付钱给你的。}
#{3550}{}{You bet I do. But it's not gonna be a breeze like before. It'll be bloodshed now, how about that? Are you in? But I warn you, no backing off now.}
{3550}{}{我当然知道。但不会像以前那样风吹草动了。会流血的，怎么样？你在吗？但我警告你，现在不要后退。}
#{3551}{}{Sure thing, I'm in!}
{3551}{}{当然，我加入了！}
#{3552}{}{Nope, I'm not gonna do this.}
{3552}{}{不，我不会这么做的。}
#{3600}{}{Glad to hear. So listen up. With you and the stuff you brought to Moore, we have enough material and manpower to get Leonard and put this war to an end. You'll go with couple of my best men; In a small group, you can get close to the border unnoticed. Shoot as many of Leonard's men as possible and most of all - kill that bitch Alexa. It'll be a bloodbath, but her death will be a great success. If you pull this off, then find Leonard somewhere in his basement. It would be better if you got him alive, but if he fidgets too much, feel free to shoot him. He doesn't deserve anything better anyway.}
{3600}{}{很高兴听到。听着。有了你和你带给摩尔的东西，我们有足够的物质和人力去抓伦纳德，结束这场战争。你将和我最好的几个人一起去；一小群人，你可以在不被注意的情况下接近边境。尽可能多的射杀伦纳德的人，最重要的是杀了那个婊子亚历克斯。这将是一场大屠杀，但她的死将是一个巨大的成功。如果你成功了，那就在莱纳德的地下室找到他。如果你能让他活着就更好了，但如果他烦躁不安，那就开枪吧。不管怎样，他不应该得到更好的东西。}
#{3601}{}{Wait a sec; are we going against superior numbers? That's suicide!}
{3601}{}{等一下，我们是不是在反对更高的数字？那是自杀！}
#{3602}{}{Well screw this.}
{3602}{}{好吧，去他的。}

It'll be a bloodbath, it appears they got a new stock of ammo up North. But that's an even bigger reason for not delaying the assault. If they got a supplier, it'll get only worse with time.

#{3650}{}{Did anyone ask for your opinion?! No, so shut up. You're a foot soldier and foot soldiers do what they're told. I have to watch my back. If they get you, at least the forces will be even and I can still stay here. I'm not going to risk more than I have to.}
{3650}{}{有人征求你的意见吗？！不，所以闭嘴。你是一个步兵，步兵按他们说的去做。我得小心点。如果他们抓到你，至少部队会平分秋色，我还能留在这里。我不会冒太大的风险。}

{3651}{}{我让自己陷入了什么，哦。。。所以你要好好教训他们。}
#{3652}{}{Screw that, I'm out.}
{3652}{}{去他妈的，我出去了。}
#{3700}{}{I said no going back, so you're dead either way. I don't care, but it would be better if we had one more man fit for the battle.}

#{3701}{}{Never! You won't drag me into this.}

#{3702}{}{Okay, I'm in.}

{3750}{}{随你的便。杀了那个胆小鬼！}
#{3751}{}{[Defend yourself.]}
{3751}{}{[为自己辩护。]}
#{3800}{}{I know this as well and have known it for much longer than you. Leonard will pay one day for that.}
{3800}{}{我也知道这件事，而且知道的时间比你长得多。莱纳德总有一天会为此付出代价的。}
#{3801}{}{No, wait, it wasn't Leonard. It was Alexa and I can prove it.}
{3801}{}{不，等等，不是莱纳德。是亚历克斯，我可以证明。}
#{3802}{}{Fine, if you don't want to hear the truth, you don't have to. Farewell.}
{3802}{}{好吧，如果你不想听实话，你不必。再会。}
#{3850}{}{No way, Alexa? That bitch? Talk. [He frowns.]}
{3850}{}{不行，亚历克斯？那个婊子？说话。[他皱眉。]}
#{3851}{}{Well, during my investigation, I came upon a lot of interesting and strange things. Maria's grave was empty and she was buried in a different one together with doctor Reed. People who knew something were dying. On top of that, the cause of her death was poison, not stab wounds. That would likely point to a woman, one who tried to clear any traces of it. It all leads to Alexa.}
{3851}{}{嗯，在我的调查中，我发现了很多有趣和奇怪的事情。玛丽亚的坟墓是空的，她和里德医生一起葬在另一个坟墓里。知道什么的人都快死了。除此之外，她的死因是毒药，而不是刺伤。这可能指向一个女人，一个试图清除任何痕迹的女人。一切都通向亚历克斯。}

#{3900}{}{Hold on... [He thinks about it for a while.] When I think of it... that blabbering of yours makes sense. I've been focused on Leonard so much I haven't even thought of this possibility. It's possible there was something between these two. Yeah, it could be her as well.}
{3900}{}{等等。。。[他想了一会儿]当我想到它。。。你的喋喋不休是有道理的。我太关注伦纳德了，我甚至没想过这种可能性。有可能这两个人之间有什么隔阂。是的，也可能是她。}
#{3901}{}{Will you help me with her? I can't take on her entire army all by myself.}

{3903}{}{这是最后的证据。我去处理她。}
#{3950}{}{[He strokes his chin.] Yeah, maybe it's time to put an end to this. With all the supplies we have thanks to you, we could finally have the upper hand. We'll form a small group, so we can at least surprise them unprepared. Stick with me, it's going to be one hell of a bloodshed!}
{3950}{}{[他抚摸着下巴]是的，也许是时候结束这一切了。多亏了你，我们才有这么多货源，我们终于可以占上风了。我们要组成一个小组，这样我们至少可以让他们措手不及。跟我来，这会是一场血战！}

#{4000}{}{Wait! You can't do it alone, I'll take some of my men and go with you. Yeah, maybe it's time to put an end to this. With all the supplies we have thanks to you, we could finally have the upper hand.}

#{4052}{}{No idea, I'll have to look for him.}
{4052}{}{不知道，我得去找他。}
#{4053}{}{Leonard's been dead for some time. He died shortly after Maria. Both were killed by Alexa. She killed Maria out of jealousy because she loved Leonard. And Leonard died because he didn't love her back. Then she spread the rumor he was hiding in the basement so she could be in command in his name.}
{4053}{}{伦纳德已经死了一段时间了。玛丽亚死后不久他就死了。两人都被亚历克斯杀死了。她出于嫉妒杀了玛丽亚，因为她爱伦纳德。莱纳德死了，因为他不爱她。然后她散布谣言说他藏在地下室，这样她就可以以他的名义指挥了。}
#{4054}{}{I think Leonard has been dead for a while. Alexa killed him. That rumor that he's hiding in the basement was just a cover so she could be in command in his name.}
{4054}{}{我想伦纳德已经死了一段时间了。亚历克斯杀了他。他躲在地下室的谣言只是个幌子，好让她以他的名义指挥。}
#{4055}{}{The basement is completely empty. There's just a collapsed corridor. I'm sorry, but Leonard probably managed to escape.}
{4055}{}{地下室空无一人。只有一条坍塌的走廊。对不起，伦纳德可能逃了出来。}
#{4056}{}{There's no one in the basement. It finally makes sense now. I think Leonard's been dead for a while.

That way she could spread the rumor about him hiding in the basement afraid to crawl out, and take command in his name.}
{4056}{}{地下室里没有人。现在终于有意义了。我想伦纳德已经死了一段时间了。他并没有杀玛丽亚，是亚历克莎杀了她，不久之后又杀了伦纳德。这样她就可以散布谣言说他躲在地下室不敢爬出来，并以他的名义指挥。}

#{4150}{}{Damn, that sure is something! Now it dawns on me too. I was so blinded by the revenge I didn't even think of this. Thanks for everything, I appreciate your help a lot and I feel better finally. Go to the weapon storehouse and take whatever you can carry, it's all yours.}
{4150}{}{妈的，真了不起！现在我也明白了。我被复仇蒙蔽了双眼，我甚至没有想到这一点。谢谢你所做的一切，我非常感谢你的帮助，我终于感觉好多了。去武器库拿你能带的东西，都是你的。}

{4151}{}{谢谢！}
