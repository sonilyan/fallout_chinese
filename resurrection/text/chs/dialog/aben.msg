#{100}{}{You see a young man.}
{100}{}{你看到一个年轻人。}
#{150}{}{You see Ben.}
{150}{}{你看到了本。}
#{200}{}{You see a young man nervously pacing around.}
{200}{}{你看到一个年轻人紧张的走来走去。}
#{250}{}{You see young Ben.}
{250}{}{你看到年轻的本。}
#{300}{}{Go away.}
{300}{}{走开。}
#{301}{}{Leave.}
{301}{}{离开。}
#{302}{}{No... I must go!}
{302}{}{不...我得走了！}
#{303}{}{Thank you again.}
{303}{}{再次感谢你。}
#{304}{}{I... alright, I'll go. I love you.}
{304}{}{呃...好吧，我去。我爱你。}
#{305}{}{::Sobs::}
{305}{}{::抽泣::}
#{306}{}{Leave me alone.}
{306}{}{别烦我。}
#{307}{}{Come back again. I'll be waiting for you.}
{307}{}{再次回来吧。我会等你的。}
#{308}{}{::Sigh::}
{308}{}{::叹气::}
#{309}{}{I'll never see her again...}
{309}{}{我再也见不到她了...}
#{400}{}{Why are you doing this?!}
{400}{}{你为什么这么做？！}
#{401}{}{You damn bastard! You'll pay for this!}
{401}{}{你这个该死的混蛋！你会为此付出代价的！}
#{500}{}{What is it?! Why are you bothering me? I've done nothing wrong!}
{500}{}{它是什么？！你为什么要烦我？我没做错什么！}
#{501}{}{Oh really? Why are you so agitated then?}
{501}{}{哦，真的吗？那你为什么这么激动？}
#{502}{}{Easy there, I'm leaving.}
{502}{}{放松点，我要走了。}
#{550}{}{I... that's none of your business! [He looks nervously towards the tribal camp.] Go away!}
{550}{}{呃...这不关你的事！[他紧张地看着部落营地。]走开！}
#{551}{}{Maybe I will. The tribals would no doubt like to know that someone has been snooping around their camp.}
{551}{}{也许我会的。部落无疑想知道有人在他们的营地周围窥探。}
#{552}{}{Nobody talks to me like that! Time to teach you a lesson.}
{552}{}{没人这样跟我说话！是时候该教训你了。}
#{553}{}{As you wish. Goodbye.}
{553}{}{如你所愿。再见。}
#{600}{}{No, it's not like that! Wait, please, I just want to give one of them something. Nothing more.}
{600}{}{不，不是那样的！等等，我只是想给他们其中一个一些东西，没别的。}
#{601}{}{Who exactly?}
{601}{}{到底是谁？}
#{602}{}{I don't believe a word of that. You're just a liar. And I bet the tribals will agree.}
{602}{}{我一个字也不相信。你只是个骗子，我估计部落会同意的。}
#{650}{}{It's for my Aleea, my girlfriend... ex-girlfriend. I left her because... I got scared. If my people found out I'm seeing a tribal, they'd exile me. [He sighs.] But I don't care about them anymore - I only care about Aleea now. I bought this earring from Alvaarez. [He shows it to you.] I want to give it to her as an apology.}
{650}{}{这是给我的阿莉娅，我的女朋友…前女朋友的。我离开她是因为…我害怕了。如果人们发现我看上一个部落女人，他们会驱逐我的。[他叹了口气。]但我不再关心他们了-我现在只关心阿莉娅。我从阿尔瓦雷斯那里买的耳环。[他给你看。]我想跟她道歉。}
#{651}{}{I see. Why are you still here then?}
{651}{}{我懂了。那你为什么还在这里？}
#{700}{}{I can't get to her. The tribals guard their camp and won't let me in. Our community isn't on the best of terms with them. I don't know what to do.}
{700}{}{我找不到她。我们的社区和他们关系不好，部落守卫不让我进他们的营地，我不知道该怎么办。}
#{701}{}{I could help you if you want. I'd go and talk to Aleea for you.}
{701}{}{如果你愿意，我可以帮你。我会替你去和阿莉娅谈谈。}
#{702}{}{I could help you if you want. I'd go and talk to Aleea for you.}
{702}{}{如果你愿意，我可以帮你。我会替你去和阿莉娅谈谈。}
#{703}{}{Well, I hope you can think of something. Bye.}
{703}{}{好吧，我希望你能想点什么办法，再见。}
#{704}{}{Too bad. That's what you get for spurning a woman that loved you. You won't get her back now, idiot.}
{704}{}{太糟糕了。这就是你抛弃一个爱你的女人所得到的。你现在不能让她回到你身边了，白痴。}
#{750}{}{You'd really do that? Here... take the earring to her. Tell her it's from Ben. You should find Aleea in one of the tents. You have to tell her that I'm sorry, that I was a fool and want to fix everything. That I want to leave Albuquerque with her, go somewhere far away where we can be together. If she agrees, tell her to go to our secret spot. I'll meet her there.}
{750}{}{你真的会这么做？给…把耳环拿给她。告诉她这是本寄来的。你应该可以在其中一个帐篷里找到阿莉娅。你必须告诉她我很抱歉，我是个傻瓜，想解决一切。我想和她一起离开阿尔伯克基，一起去一个遥远的地方。如果她同意，告诉她去我们的秘密地点，我会在那里与她汇合。}
#{751}{}{You'd really do that? Here... take the earring to her. Tell her it's from Ben. You should find Aleea in one of the tents.

#{752}{}{We'll see what she has to say. I'll be back with her answer.}
{752}{}{我们来看看她怎么说。我会带着她的答案回来的。}
#{800}{}{What? Why do you bother me again?}
{800}{}{什么？你干嘛又来烦我？}
#{801}{}{I think you're up to no good. How about I go tell the tribals?}
{801}{}{我认为你做得不好。我去告诉部落怎么样？}
#{802}{}{I've decided to help you. If you want, I can go and talk to Aleea for you.}
{802}{}{我决定帮助你。如果你愿意，我可以去帮你和阿莉娅谈谈。}
#{803}{}{I've decided to help you. If you want, I can go and talk to Aleea for you.}
{803}{}{我决定帮助你。如果你愿意，我可以去帮你和阿莉娅谈谈。}
#{804}{}{Sorry. I'm leaving.}
{804}{}{很抱歉，我要走了。}
#{805}{}{Uh.}
{805}{}{呃。}
#{850}{}{Well? Did you talk to Aleea yet?}
{850}{}{好？你和阿莉娅谈过了吗？}
#{851}{}{Well? Did you talk to Aleea yet?}
{851}{}{好？你和阿莉娅谈过了吗？}
#{852}{}{I'm working on it. Just wait a bit longer.}
{852}{}{我正在努力。再等一会儿。}
#{853}{}{Eh, yes. Sorry Ben, but she isn't coming. She doesn't want you anymore.}
{853}{}{呃，是的。对不起，本，但她不来了。她不再需要你了。}
#{854}{}{You're out of luck, Ben. Aleea isn't coming. She found... someone else.}
{854}{}{你运气不好，本。阿莉娅不来了。她找到了... 另一个人。}
#{855}{}{Yes, she's decided to give you another chance. So don't mess it up.}
{855}{}{是的，她决定再给你一次机会。所以不要把事情搞砸了。}
#{856}{}{Uh.}
{856}{}{呃。}
#{900}{}{How... how can this be? But... [He starts sobbing quietly.] She was my everything. What will I do without her?}
{900}{}{怎... 怎么会这样？但是... [他开始安静地哭泣。]她是我的一切。没有她我怎么办？}
#{901}{}{No idea. I hope you'll come to terms with that someday. Goodbye.}
{901}{}{不知道。我希望有一天你能接受这一点。再见。}
#{902}{}{Aleea wasn't the last woman in the world, Ben. There are others. [Smile at him.] One of them could comfort you, if you want.}
{902}{}{阿莉娅不是世界上最后一个女人，本，还有别的女人。[对他微笑。]如果你愿意，还有其它人可以安慰你。}
#{950}{}{[He looks at you.] I... don't know. You're beautiful, but... I love Aleea. I can't stop thinking about her.}
{950}{}{[他看着你。]我... 不知道。你很漂亮，但我爱阿莉娅，我一直在想她。}
#{951}{}{Your loss, Ben. Bye.}
{951}{}{这是你的损失，本。再见。}
#{952}{}{You don't want to make love to me?! Are you really a man, or a loser using some other girl as an excuse? She left you! I bet you've never done it before and you're just scared.}
{952}{}{你不想和我做爱？！你真的是一个男人，还是一个以其他女孩为借口的失败者？她离开了你！我打赌你以前从未做过，你只是害怕而已 。}
#{1000}{}{That... that was amazing. You're amazing... much better than Aleea. I can't believe I wasted my time on her.}
{1000}{}{那…那太棒了。你太棒了…比阿莉娅好多了。真不敢相信我在她身上浪费了那么多时间。}
#{1001}{}{Thanks. A little advice - talking about your ex isn't really a good idea at times like this.}
{1001}{}{谢谢，一个小小的建议- 在这种时候谈论你的前任并不是一个好主意。}
#{1050}{}{Sorry, you're right. I just wanted to say how much I liked it with you. [He goes quiet for a while, as if he's looking for the right words.] Do you think we could see each other again? I don't want to lose you. In fact... I was planning to leave the city with Aleea. If you want, I could go with you. I've managed to save 500 caps from my pay as a caravan loader. That could help us start again.}
{1050}{}{对不起，你说得对。我只是想说我有多喜欢和你在一起。[他沉默了一会儿，好像在寻找合适的词语。]你认为我们还能再次见面吗？我不想失去你。事实上…我本来打算和阿莉娅一起离开这座城市，如果你愿意，我可以和你一起走。作为一名商队装卸工，我设法从工资中节省了500瓶盖，这可以帮助我们开始新生活。}
#{1051}{}{I'd love to go, but we wouldn't get very far with so few caps, Ben. Maybe when you earn more... then we can go. And give me those caps. They'll be safer with me.}
{1051}{}{我很想去，但我们的瓶盖太少了，走不了多远，本。也许当你赚得更多的时候我们就可以走了。把瓶盖放我这会更安全的。}
#{1052}{}{You misunderstand, I don't want anything to do with you anymore. This won't happen again. Goodbye.}
{1052}{}{你误会了，我不想再和你有任何关系了，这种情况不会再发生了，再见。}
#{1100}{}{Eh, alright. [He gives you all his caps.] I'll try.}
{1100}{}{嗯，好吧。[他把瓶盖都给你了。]我会尽力的。}
#{1101}{}{I hope so. Be seeing you, Ben.}
{1101}{}{希望如此。再见了，本。}
#{1150}{}{What the hell... I'll show you what a man I am, since you asked for it! Come with me!}
{1150}{}{该死的…我会让你知道我是个什么样的人，因为是你要求我这么做！跟我来！}
#{1151}{}{Oh I'm so very curious. [Go with him to his house.]}
{1151}{}{哦，我太好奇了。[和他一起去他家。]}
#{1200}{}{You're finally back! I was worried you might not return. [He presses himself to you.] Sadly, I don't have any more money right now. I'm really sorry.}
{1200}{}{你终于回来了！我担心你可能不会回来了。[他抵着你。]很遗憾，我现在没钱了，我真的很抱歉。}
#{1201}{}{[Pull away.] In that case, we have nothing to say to each other, Ben. I hope you'll try harder next time.}
{1201}{}{[走开。]那样的话，我们就没什么可说的了，本。我希望你下次再努力一点。}
#{1202}{}{That doesn't matter. I've heard something terrible. They say that a dangerous disease is spreading through the city! You must visit the doctors in the hospital for a check-up as soon as possible.}
{1202}{}{那没关系。我听说了一些可怕的事情，他们说一种危险的疾病正在城市蔓延！你必须尽快去医院找医生检查一下身体。}
#{1203}{}{Uh.}
{1203}{}{呃。}
#{1250}{}{Eh, I feel fine. I've heard a couple of nasty rumors about the doctors, too. I'd rather not go to them.}
{1250}{}{嗯，我感觉很好。我也听到了一些关于医生的流言。我宁愿不去他们那里。}
#{1251}{}{Surely you don't believe those. I'm worried about you, I don't want anything to happen to you. I've already made an appointment with them. All you need to do is find doctor Falber.}
{1251}{}{你肯定不相信这些。我很担心你，我不想让你发生任何事。我已经和他们约好了，你需要做的就是去找福伯医生。}
#{1252}{}{I guess you're right. Forget about it.}
{1252}{}{我想你是对的，算了吧。}
#{1300}{}{[He looks at you.] I... no, please leave. I want to be alone.}
{1300}{}{[他看着你。]我...不，请离开。我想一个人呆着。}
#{1301}{}{You don't know what you're missing. Bye.}
{1301}{}{你不知道你错过了什么。再见。}
#{1350}{}{I... you can't even imagine how grateful I am. For the rest of my life, I will be in your debt. Now... now I must go. I can't keep Aleea waiting.}
{1350}{}{嗯... 你甚至无法想象我有多么的感激。在我的余生里，我都欠你的债。现在…现在我必须走了，我不能让阿莉娅再等了。}
#{1351}{}{Farewell. May you stay together this time.}
{1351}{}{再见，希望你们这次能在一起。}
#{1400}{}{You're finally back! I was worried you wouldn't return. I got }
{1400}{}{你终于回来了！我担心你不会回来了。我得到了}
#{1401}{}{ caps for loading the caravans. Here they are.}
{1401}{}{ 商队装卸的瓶盖。在这儿。}
#{1402}{}{We're a little closer to our journey now. You're a great guy, Ben.}
{1402}{}{我们现在离我们的旅程有点近了。你是个很棒的人，本。}
#{1403}{}{Well, I hope you'll do better next time. Bye.}
{1403}{}{好吧，我希望你下次能做得更好。再见。}
#{1404}{}{[Take the caps.] I've heard something terrible. They say that a dangerous disease is spreading through the city! You must visit the doctors in the hospital for a check-up as soon as possible..}
{1404}{}{[拿走瓶盖。]我听说了一些可怕的事。他们说一种危险的疾病正在城市蔓延！你必须尽快去医院找医生做检查。}
#{1405}{}{Uh.}
{1405}{}{呃。}
#{1450}{}{You know I'd do anything for you. Come to me, love...}
{1450}{}{你知道我会为你做任何事。来吧，亲爱的...}
#{1451}{}{Oh Ben...}
{1451}{}{哦，本...}
#{1452}{}{Sorry, but I don't have time for that. I need to go.}
{1452}{}{抱歉，我没有时间。我得走了。}
#{1500}{}{How... how can this be? But... [He starts sobbing quietly.] Who did she leave me for?}
{1500}{}{怎...怎么会这样？但是...[他开始安静地抽泣。]她为了谁离开我？}
#{1501}{}{If you must know, Aleea chose me. I didn't even have to try too hard. By the way, she really liked the earring you gave me...}
{1501}{}{如果你一定要知道的话，阿莉娅选择了我，我甚至没怎么费劲。顺便说一下，她真的很喜欢你给我的耳环...}
#{1502}{}{If you must know, Aleea chose me. I didn't even have to try too hard...}
{1502}{}{如果你一定要知道的话，阿莉娅选择了我。我甚至没怎么费劲...}
#{1503}{}{No Idea. Bye, Ben.}
{1503}{}{不知道。再见，本。}
