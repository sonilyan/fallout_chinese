{3}{}{你看到埃尔德了。}

### {10}{}{[Her clothes are made of hides and pelts banded with leather straps. Her wrinkly face is shadowed by a strange, crown-like construction, mounted on her head: colored wires hold together different circuit boards, plates, antennas, and withered buns of fragrant herbs. The image is completed by a skull of a child, dangling on a braided string, which is wrapped around her slender neck] You... The Twilight Viper sees you! [she howls a little on every word, stretching the vowels] Don't try to lie to the Elder, for Viper himself is looking through her eyes!}
{10}{}{[她的衣服是用皮革带子绑起来的兽皮和毛皮做成的。她布满皱纹的脸被一种奇怪的、皇冠状的结构所遮蔽，这种结构安装在她的头上：彩色的电线将不同的电路板、板、天线和枯萎的香草包连在一起。这幅图像是由一个孩子的头骨完成的，头骨悬挂在编织线上，编织线缠绕在她纤细的脖子上]你。。。黄昏毒蛇看到你了！[她每个字都吼了一声，拉长了元音]不要试图对长老撒谎，因为Viper自己正在透过她的眼睛看！}
### {11}{012}{What the hell? Who? Viper?}
{11}{012}{什么鬼东西？谁毒蛇}
### {12}{012}{Are you having a stroke? What are you talking about?}
{12}{012}{你中风了吗？你在说什么？}
### {13}{011}{Elder? That means you are in charge here, right?}
{13}{011}{长者这意味着你在这里负责，对吧？}
### {14}{017}{Did you see a sand wolf running by?}
{14}{017}{你看到一只沙狼跑过吗？}
### {15}{999}{No, I'm not ready for this kind of talk. I'd better go.}
{15}{999}{不，我还没有准备好进行这种谈话。我最好去。}


### {1001}{}{[Elder cycles through a set of bone beads, quietly mumbling something] ...May the two-legged prey not escape the hands of Twilight Viper's children... [she gives you a mean look] What do you need, outsider? [she is howling on vowels again] You are bothering Elder's praying...}
{1001}{}{【长老骑着自行车穿过一组骨珠，轻声喃喃自语】。。。愿这两条腿的猎物不会逃脱黄昏毒蛇的孩子们的手。。。[她恶狠狠地看了你一眼]你需要什么，局外人？[她又在元音上嚎叫]你在打扰埃尔德的祈祷。。。}
### {101}{012}{Who is this Viper you mentioned?}
{101}{012}{你提到的这个毒蛇是谁？}
### {102}{011}{I have a couple of questions for you, Elder.}
{102}{011}{我有几个问题要问你，长老。}
### {103}{017}{Did you see a sand wolf running by?}
{103}{017}{你看到一只沙狼跑过吗？}
### {104}{999}{I won't be interrupting you anymore. See you later.}
{104}{999}{我不会再打扰你了。回头见。}
### {1002}{}{[She grabs the skull on her neck and grimly nods] You came again. Why? If you think that being part of the tribe gives you the right to bother me all day long, you are wrong, may Viper rip your throat! Go do something useful, little man! [at least now she talks without howling]}
{1002}{}{[她抓住脖子上的头骨，冷酷地点了点头]你又来了。为什么？如果你认为作为部落的一员，你有权整天打扰我，那你错了，愿毒蛇割断你的喉咙！去做点有用的事吧，小个子！[至少现在她说话不叫]}
### {105}{012}{Now, can you explain to me the details about your gods? Or spirits, I don't know how to call it.}
{105}{012}{现在，你能向我解释一下关于你的神的细节吗？或者灵魂，我不知道该怎么称呼它。}
### {106}{011}{I'm only going to ask a couple of questions.}
{106}{011}{我只想问几个问题。}
### {107}{017}{Did you see a sand wolf running by?}
{107}{017}{你看到一只沙狼跑过吗？}
### {108}{999}{Okay, don't be mad. See you later.}
{108}{999}{好吧，别生气。回头见。}


### {1101}{}{[She adjusts her headgear, so a couple of antennas now point straight at you] Spend my time wisely, outsider! Twilight Viper doesn't like when his shaman is distracted from prayers! One mistake, and you are being served to our table before due! [as she finishes her speech, her voice sounds almost like wolf-like howling]}
{1101}{}{[她调整了她的头盔，所以现在有几根天线直接指向你]明智地度过我的时间，局外人！黄昏毒蛇不喜欢他的萨满分心祈祷！一个错误，你会在到期前被送到我们的桌子上！[当她结束演讲时，她的声音听起来几乎像狼一样嚎叫]}
### {111}{014}{Yeah, about your protein diet. Am I getting this right that eating people is OK for you?}
{111}{014}{是的，关于你的蛋白质饮食。我说得对吗，吃人对你来说是可以的？}
### {112}{013}{So, you are also the shaman, right? }
{112}{013}{所以，你也是萨满，对吧？}
### {113}{015}{Your tribesmen won't let me leave this place! It could be a problem...}
{113}{015}{你们部落的人不会让我离开这里的！这可能是个问题。。。}
### {114}{021}{I don't really respect elders, so if you threaten me - I'll make it harder for you to chew. }
{114}{021}{我真的不尊重长辈，所以如果你威胁我，我会让你更难咀嚼。}
### {115}{016}{Can you tell me about your tribe?}
{115}{016}{你能告诉我你的部落吗？}
### {116}{013}{Ha! Are you communicating with spirits using these antennas?}
{116}{013}{哈你在用这些天线与灵魂交流吗？}
### {117}{999}{Okay! I'm leaving...}
{117}{999}{可以我要走了。。。}
### {1102}{}{[She thoughtfully moves her sight from a ritual club on her belt to your head, and then back to a club] Very well. Ask. Maybe you'll give me the reason to rip your tongue out...}
{1102}{}{[她若有所思地把视线从腰带上的仪式球杆移到你的头上，然后又回到球杆上]很好。问也许你会给我理由把你的舌头扯出来。。。}
### {118}{014}{I suppose it's a delicate dish for you here. I mean, is it really necessary? But don't give me this "spirits and stuff" bullshit.}
{118}{014}{我想这对你来说是一道精致的菜。我的意思是，这真的有必要吗？但不要给我这些“精神和东西”的废话。}
### {119}{013}{Why do you play the part of a shaman? Don't you get enough respect?}
{119}{013}{你为什么扮演萨满？你没有得到足够的尊重吗？}
### {1110}{021}{I don't really respect elders, so if YOU threaten ME - you are risking YOUR tongue. }
{1110}{021}{我真的不尊重长辈，所以如果你威胁我，你就是在冒舌头的风险。}
### {1111}{016}{Can you tell me about your tribe? In normal voice?}
{1111}{016}{你能告诉我你的部落吗？用正常的声音？}
### {1112}{999}{Although, I need to go. See you later.}
{1112}{999}{尽管如此，我还是得走了。回头见。}


### {1201}{}{[She starts to slowly spin around, howling and tapping foot] ...And when the cleansing flame came roaming the earth, Twilight Viper created these mountains to keep all of his children safe! [she then proceeds with some gibberish on a language unknown to you. Some kind of prayer, maybe?] He filled these cliffs with his might, which had been pouring on us year after year! And we rose above all others in height and strength! Now he watches over his tribe through the eyes of his shaman and talks through her mouth... May the Viper be great and praised!}
{1201}{}{[她开始慢慢地旋转，嚎叫着，轻拍着脚]。。。当净化之火在地球上游荡时，暮光毒蛇创造了这些山脉来保护他的所有孩子的安全！[然后她用一种你不知道的语言胡言乱语。也许是某种祈祷？]他用他的力量填满了这些悬崖，年复一年地倾泻在我们身上！我们的身高和力量都超过了其他人！现在，他通过萨满的眼睛看着他的部落，通过她的嘴说话。。。愿毒蛇变得伟大并受到赞扬！}
### {121}{021}{The hell? You can piss into the ears of your overgrown kin as much as you want, but it won't work with me!}
{121}{021}{他妈的？你可以随心所欲地往你杂草丛生的亲戚的耳朵里撒尿，但这对我不起作用！}
### {122}{999}{Very... Interesting. Thanks for the answer.}
{122}{999}{非常有趣的谢谢你的回答。}
### {1202}{}{[She puts some herbs into her mouth and starts to slowly chew] Good for your teeth, you should try it... Mmm... If I tell you, would you leave me alone? Okay... The tribe should know that someone big is watching over them. And people need to believe that their deeds will be justified by higher authorities. Our spirits are not worse than any others, that's it. And besides, this place, it's... Strange. These thingies that outsiders used to talk to each other from a distance are of no use here, but our bodies receive this unknown strength... So it's easy to believe anything you want. Sometimes even I... [she pauses, thinking about something] }
{1202}{}{[她把一些草药放进嘴里，开始慢慢咀嚼]对你的牙齿有好处，你应该试试…嗯。。。如果我告诉你，你会放过我吗？可以部落应该知道有一个大人物在监视他们。人们需要相信，他们的行为会得到上级当局的证明。我们的精神并不比其他人差，仅此而已。此外，这个地方。。。奇怪的这些外人过去在远处交谈的东西在这里没有用，但我们的身体获得了这种未知的力量。。。所以你很容易相信任何你想要的东西。有时甚至我…[她停顿了一下，想了想什么]}
### {123}{021}{You are really sick in the head, worshiping such stupid things! It's time to stop this charade!}
{123}{021}{你崇拜这些愚蠢的东西，真是令人恶心！是时候停止这种把戏了！}
### {124}{999}{Opiate of the masses, huh? Okay, I'm leaving you alone, just as I promised.}
{124}{999}{群众的鸦片，是吗？好吧，我就让你一个人呆着，正如我承诺的那样。}


### {1301}{}{When Elder chooses a successor, she bestows upon her this sacred headdress, through which our spirits talk to us! Because not always the feeble human mind is capable of finding the answer to any question! Elder should be a shaman, so nothing could stay hidden in the shadows of the unknown!}
{1301}{}{当长老选择继任者时，她会将这顶神圣的头饰赐给她，我们的灵魂通过这顶头饰与我们交谈！因为并非总是软弱的人类头脑能够找到任何问题的答案！长老应该是一个萨满，所以没有什么可以隐藏在未知的阴影中！}
### {131}{011}{Another question then.}
{131}{011}{那又是一个问题。}
### {132}{022}{So only a woman can become an Elder?}
{132}{022}{所以只有女人才能成为长老？}
### {133}{999}{I see... That's it for now. See you.}
{133}{999}{我明白了。。。现在就这样。再见}
### {1302}{}{[She scratches her crocheted nose with a ritual club's handle] It's one thing when some old woman, even an Elder, mumbles something, and the other - when a mighty spirit is talking through her. This knowledge is something I will eventually pass on to my successor too... }
{1302}{}{[她用仪式俱乐部的把手挠了挠钩编的鼻子]当某个老妇人，甚至是一位长者，喃喃自语时，这是一回事，而另一件事――当一个强大的灵魂通过她说话时。我最终也会把这些知识传授给我的继任者。。。}
### {134}{011}{I see. Another question then.}
{134}{011}{我明白了。那又是一个问题。}
### {135}{022}{Successor? So only a woman can become an Elder?}
{135}{022}{继承人所以只有女人才能成为长老？}
### {136}{999}{I see. Let's take a break.}
{136}{999}{我明白了。让我们休息一下。}


### {1401}{}{[She widely smiles, showing a set of teeth definitely not like one of an old person] People are only those of the tribe! The rest are outsiders! Eating outsiders pleases our holy spirits! You will have this great honor too!}
{1401}{}{[她笑容满面，露出一副牙齿，绝对不像老人的牙齿]人都是部落里的人！其余的都是外人！吃外地人让我们的圣灵高兴！你也将获得这一殊荣！}
### {141}{021}{Go fuck yourself, fucking cannibal! Let's see what your spirits are going to do when I blast your brains out! }
{141}{021}{去他妈的，他妈的食人族！让我们看看当我把你的脑袋炸飞的时候，你的灵魂会做什么！}
### {142}{011}{Easy, we don't know each other this well yet. Better tell me something else...}
{142}{011}{别紧张，我们还不太了解对方。最好告诉我别的事。。。}
### {143}{999}{Thank you, of course, but I'm too humble for such honors. Actually, I've got to go.}
{143}{999}{当然谢谢你，但我太谦虚了，不能获得这样的荣誉。事实上，我得走了。}
### {1402}{}{[She widely smiles, showing a set of teeth definitely not like one of an old person] Two-legged prey is easier to kill. Those who are beyond the mountains... Even with their weapons, they are still not as dangerous as wild animals - whose numbers, by the way, are diminishing with each year... And our powerful warriors need to eat a lot! How to feed them, if not forcing them to eat everything there is? }
{1402}{}{[她笑容满面，露出一副牙齿，绝对不像老人的牙齿]两足猎物更容易被杀死。那些在山外的人。。。即使有了武器，它们仍然没有野生动物那么危险――顺便说一句，野生动物的数量每年都在减少。。。我们强大的战士需要吃很多！如果不强迫它们吃所有的东西，如何喂养它们？}
### {144}{021}{I'm a lot more dangerous than any creature of the Radius. And I'm going to prove it right now. Today the hunter becomes the prey!}
{144}{021}{我比任何半径生物都危险得多。我现在就要证明这一点。今天猎人成了猎物！}
### {145}{011}{At least it sounds honest. I have other questions.}
{145}{011}{至少听起来很诚实。我还有其他问题。}
### {146}{999}{I see. I need to think about it...}
{146}{999}{我明白了。我需要考虑一下。。。}


### {150}{}{[She seems to speak with a monotonous tone, but you definitely hear sinister notes in her voice] Everyone can enter into the house of Twilight Viper, but not everyone can leave! But I will help you - by releasing your spirit on a Red Field after a ritual! Only your flesh will stay here, but you would be free to fly away wherever you like... }
{150}{}{【她说话的语气似乎很单调，但你肯定能从她的声音中听到险恶的音符】每个人都可以进入暮光之蛇的房子，但不是每个人都能离开！但我会帮助你――在仪式结束后，在红场释放你的灵魂！只有你的肉体会留在这里，但你可以自由地飞到任何你喜欢的地方。。。}
### {151}{023}{Sounds tempting. But I'd like to leave this place in a full package.}
{151}{023}{听起来很诱人。但我想打包离开这个地方。}
### {152}{023}{You'd better come up with another option, while someone didn't get hurt...}
{152}{023}{你最好想出另一个选择，趁有人没有受伤。。。}
### {153}{021}{That's me who is going to free you from your flesh, you animals! Starting from you, old bitch!!}
{153}{021}{就是我要把你们从肉体中解放出来，你们这些动物！从你开始，老婊子！！}
### {154}{999}{I'd like to think about the alternatives...}
{154}{999}{我想考虑一下其他选择。。。}


### {1601}{}{Outsider can never comprehend the thoughts of Twilight Viper's children! But ask, you have that right before the Last Supper... Last for you. }
{1601}{}{外人永远无法理解黄昏毒蛇的孩子们的想法！但你要问，在最后的晚餐之前你有这个权利。。。最后为你。}
### {161}{018}{Do you have someone around here who knows healing?}
{161}{018}{你身边有人知道治愈吗？}
### {162}{019}{I just need to know - do you have a normal family?}
{162}{019}{我只需要知道――你有正常的家庭吗？}
### {163}{020}{What does your tribe do?}
{163}{020}{你的部落是做什么的？}
### {164}{011}{To other questions...}
{164}{011}{对于其他问题。。。}
### {1602}{}{[Sighs] Why didn't you lose to Klumk... Ask, little man.}
{1602}{}{你为什么不输给克鲁姆克。。。问问，小个子。}
### {165}{018}{Do you have someone around here who knows healing?}
{165}{018}{你身边有人知道治愈吗？}
### {166}{020}{I just need to know - do you have a normal family?}
{166}{020}{我只需要知道――你有正常的家庭吗？}
### {167}{020}{What does your... Our tribe do?}
{167}{020}{你的。。。我们部落做什么？}
### {168}{011}{To other questions...}
{168}{011}{对于其他问题。。。}


### {170}{}{[She pulls up a hide on her shoulder] This abode of fleas has finally run off? Good news! Or I would have skinned him myself eventually...}
{170}{}{[她在肩上拉起一张皮]这个跳蚤的住处终于跑了？好消息！否则我最终会亲自剥他的皮。。。}
### {171}{021}{Maybe that's what you actually did? Tell me, old hag, while you still have YOUR skin on yourself!  }
{171}{021}{也许你就是这么做的？告诉我，老巫婆，趁你还活着的时候！}
### {172}{999}{I suppose this means no... Well, I'll continue my search elsewhere.}
{172}{999}{我想这意味着不…好吧，我会继续在其他地方寻找。}


### {1801}{}{[Her face darkens] Khala, our healer, can treat wounds. She also cooks, and she is very protective about her duties. Too much even... You'll meet her soon.}
{1801}{}{[她的脸变黑了]我们的治疗师Khala可以治疗伤口。她也会做饭，而且她非常保护自己的职责。甚至太多了。。。你很快就会见到她。}
### {181}{011}{Yes, I'll come by her, if I get the chance...}
{181}{011}{是的，如果有机会的话，我会和她一起去。。。}
### {182}{999}{That's all I needed. All the best.}
{182}{999}{这就是我所需要的。一切都好。}
### {1802}{}{[She tries to look sad, but can't hide her smile] Khala, our healer, could treat wounds and cook... What a huge loss for us! Now this bitch- this worthy daughter of our tribe is making our spirits happy with tales of her devotion!}
{1802}{}{[她试图看起来很悲伤，但无法掩饰她的微笑]我们的治疗师Khala可以治疗伤口和做饭。。。对我们来说是多么巨大的损失啊！现在，这个婊子――我们部落的这个值得尊敬的女儿，正在用她的奉献故事让我们的灵魂感到高兴！}
### {183}{011}{I share your sorrow. Now, to other questions...}
{183}{011}{我和你一样悲伤。现在，对于其他问题。。。}
### {184}{999}{We all will be there eventually. And I've got to go.}
{184}{999}{我们最终都会到达那里。我得走了。}
### {1803}{}{[She frowns, like biting a rotten apple] Khala... She is our cook and our healer. If only she doesn't like to shed blood so much... Doesn't matter which... But warriors treat her with respect, so we have to deal with her habits. And, to do her justice, her cooking is very good, I admit that. Outsider's thighs with brains as a garnish... Yum... [she slurps]}
{1803}{}{[她皱着眉头，像咬烂苹果一样。。。她是我们的厨师和治疗师。如果她不那么喜欢流血就好了。。。不管是哪一个。。。但战士们尊重她，所以我们必须处理她的习惯。而且，公平地说，我承认她的厨艺非常好。用脑子装饰的外人的大腿。。。呀[她咕哝着]}
### {185}{011}{I'll come by her if I get the chance. Another question.}
{185}{011}{如果有机会，我会跟她一起去。另一个问题。}
### {186}{999}{I feel hungry already. I'd better go bite on something.}
{186}{999}{我已经觉得饿了。我最好去吃点什么。}
### {1804}{}{[She grunts] Yes, there was... Khala. But our spirits made a present for me and took her away. That's where she belongs.}
{1804}{}{[她咕哝着]是的，有。。。哈拉。但我们的灵魂为我做了一份礼物，把她带走了。那是她应该去的地方。}
### {187}{011}{I'm truly sorry for your loss. Let's return to other questions......}
{187}{011}{我对你的损失深表歉意。让我们回到其他问题。。。。。。}

{188}{999}{我们最终都会到达那里。我得走了。}


### {1901}{}{[Her vicious wrinkled face becomes calm for a while] Ptuna... Someday my daughter will be a worthy Elder and bring the tribe to true prosperity! }
{1901}{}{[她那张布满皱纹的凶狠的脸平静了一会儿]普图纳。。。总有一天，我的女儿会成为一位值得尊敬的长者，并使部落真正繁荣起来！}
### {191}{011}{This is great. But I have another question...}
{191}{011}{这太棒了。但我还有一个问题。。。}
### {192}{999}{Good for you. I need to go, see you.}
{192}{999}{这对你很好。我得走了，再见。}
### {1902}{}{[Her vicious wrinkled face becomes calm for a while] Ptuna is my family. She lacks the spirit for now, but when I retire, she is the one who takes my place. She never failed me... Always loved her old mother... [Looks like you see a tear in her eye, but she immediately becomes firm] That's it, go away! My memory is not as good as before, I can forget that I shouldn't eat you! }
{1902}{}{[她那张布满皱纹的凶狠的脸平静了一会儿]普图纳是我的家人。她现在缺乏精神，但当我退休时，她是接替我的人。她从未辜负过我…一直爱着她的老母亲。。。[看起来你看到她眼里有泪水，但她立刻变得坚定]就是这样，走开！我的记忆力大不如前了，我可以忘记我不应该吃你！}
### {193}{999}{Okay, okay, I'm leaving. Talk later.}
{193}{999}{好吧，好吧，我要走了。稍后再谈。}


### {2001}{}{The only honorable occupation for Viper's children is the hunt! [proving her point, she smashes a rat, which was running by, with one blow of her club. Blood splatters everywhere] The feet of our warriors are fast, weapons are sharp, and never miss the target!}
{2001}{}{Viper的孩子们唯一光荣的职业就是狩猎！【为了证明自己的观点，她用球杆一拳就击碎了一只正在奔跑的老鼠。鲜血四溅】我们战士的脚步很快，武器很锋利，永远不会错过目标！}
### {201}{011}{Definitely honorable. Would you mind answering another question?}
{201}{011}{绝对光荣。你介意再回答一个问题吗？}
### {202}{999}{I see... Okay, I'm done with questions for now.}
{202}{999}{我明白了。。。好吧，我暂时不提问题了。}
### {2002}{}{[She squints her faded eyes as if trying to look beyond the mountains] What else to do here? This place has given us height and strength, but not food. We have to get it by ourselves. To try cultivating this land is pointless, so there's only one option for the tribe. And if we need something that we can't hunt, we can trade it from outsiders.}
{2002}{}{[她眯起褪了色的眼睛，好像想看看山外]在这里还能做什么？这个地方给了我们身高和力量，但没有给我们食物。我们必须自己去拿。尝试耕种这片土地毫无意义，所以部落只有一个选择。如果我们需要一些我们无法狩猎的东西，我们可以从外来者那里进行交易。}
### {203}{011}{It must be not easy to live here... Tell me about something else.}
{203}{011}{住在这里一定不容易。。。告诉我其他的事情。}
### {204}{999}{I see... Okay, I'm done with questions for now.}
{204}{999}{我明白了。。。好吧，我暂时不提问题了。}


### {210}{}{[She is visibly angered. Slowly stepping back, she hisses through clenched teeth] How stupid an outsider can be! How hastily he desires to get into our stomachs! He doesn't understand how to talk properly here, and to whom! [she yells so loud that you become deaf for a moment] Come, Viper's warriors! Prey is here!}
{210}{}{[她明显被激怒了。慢慢地后退，咬着牙发出嘶嘶声]一个局外人真愚蠢！他多么急于钻进我们的肚子！他不明白在这里该怎么说话，也不明白该对谁说话！[她大声喊叫，让你一时失聪]来吧，毒蛇的战士们！普瑞来了！}
### {211}{998}{They won't be here in time to help you, bitch!}
{211}{998}{他们不会及时来帮你的，婊子！}
### {212}{998}{Man, why no one is glad to see me...}
{212}{998}{伙计，为什么没人高兴看到我。。。}


### {2201}{}{[She starts to shake, raising the head to the sky and speaking in a sing-song voice] ...And so the woman's loin is from where our warriors come into this world, and so she is the one worthy of speaking the voice of spirits to the tribe!}
{2201}{}{[她开始颤抖，抬头对着天空，用歌声说话]。。。所以这个女人的腰肉是我们的战士来到这个世界的地方，所以她是值得向部落发出灵魂之声的人！}
### {221}{011}{Makes perfect sense. Let's talk about something else.}
{221}{011}{很有道理。让我们谈谈其他事情。}
### {222}{999}{It's just sexism! Too bad I need to go, or I would explain to you something...}
{222}{999}{这只是性别歧视！可惜我得走了，否则我会向你解释一些事情。。。}
### {223}{999}{So that's how it is? Okay, I leave you to enjoy your chosenness. See you around.}
{223}{999}{事情就是这样？好吧，我让你享受你的选择。回头见。}
### {2202}{}{[She gives you a look of disdain] Who else? Men? Men put into power... Been there, done that - just look what the old world ended up with. And I won't let that happen to my tribe!}
{2202}{}{[她轻蔑地看了你一眼]还有谁？男人？男人掌权。。。去过那里，做过那件事――看看旧世界的结局吧。我不会让这种事发生在我的部落！}
### {224}{011}{Let's not get into details. Better answer me something else.}
{224}{011}{我们不谈细节了。最好回答我一些别的问题。}
### {225}{999}{It's just sexism! Too bad I need to go, or I would explain to you something...}
{225}{999}{这只是性别歧视！可惜我得走了，否则我会向你解释一些事情。。。}
### {226}{999}{Like I need it...  Okay, I'm going. See you around, Elder.}
{226}{999}{就像我需要它一样…好吧，我要走了。回头见，长老。}


### {230}{}{[Looks like she is quite tired of you. Suddenly, she brights up with a new idea] Outsider can leave... If he beats mighty Klumk in battle! Twilight Viper tells me it's impossible... But it's good to show the tribe how weak outsiders are when facing our warriors! And they can feast on your flesh afterward. So, even if an outcome is predefined, I'm offering you to participate in this. And no weapons - only what's with you from the moment you were born!}
{230}{}{[看起来她对你很厌倦。突然，她想出了一个新主意]外人可以离开了。。。如果他在战斗中击败强大的克鲁姆克！暮光之蛇告诉我这是不可能的。。。但当面对我们的战士时，向部落展示局外人是多么软弱是件好事！然后他们可以享用你的肉。所以，即使结果是预先确定的，我也愿意让你参与进来。没有武器――只有从你出生的那一刻起就伴随着你的东西！}
### {231}{024}{That's it? To put down one of your stupid thugs? Ha! Easy!}
{231}{024}{就这样？打倒你的一个愚蠢的暴徒？哈容易的}
### {232}{024}{Well, if there's no other way... Shall we begin?}
{232}{024}{如果没有别的办法。。。我们可以开始了吗？}
### {233}{021}{Okay, I'm sick of it. Listen here, you wrinkled carcass, now you immediately command your overgrown idiots to clear the passage, or I'm leaving anyway, but this place gets filled with your corpses!}
{233}{021}{好吧，我受够了。听着，你这个皱巴巴的尸体，现在你立即命令你那些杂草丛生的白痴清理通道，否则我无论如何都要离开，但这个地方到处都是你的尸体！}
### {234}{999}{No, I'd better search for alternative solutions. }
{234}{999}{不，我最好寻找其他解决方案。}


### {240}{}{[You patiently wait in the local "diner" for a crowd of spectators to gather and for your opponent to arrive. Then he appears - naked from the waist up, body painted with blood. Elder starts to gently howl, making it louder with every minute] Here comes the mighty Klumk, to break the bones of an outsider, to drink his blood, to put his flesh on our table! Observe it carefully, my children!}
{240}{}{[你在当地的“餐厅”耐心地等待着一群观众的到来，等待着你的对手的到来。然后他出现了――从腰部以上赤裸着，身上沾满了血。埃尔德开始轻轻地嚎叫，每分钟都变得更大声]强大的克鲁姆克来了，他要打断一个局外人的骨头，喝他的血，把他的肉放在我们的桌子上！仔细观察，我的孩子们！}
### {241}{999}{Yeah, yeah. Shall we start?}
{241}{999}{是的，是的。我们开始吧？}
### {242}{999}{I should have brought a chair...}
{242}{999}{我应该带一把椅子。。。}
### {243}{999}{I'm going to bury you, you scum! I'll rip off your entrails and choke you with them! Come on! Come!}
{243}{999}{我要把你埋了，你们这些渣滓！我要扯下你的内脏，用它们把你掐死！来吧来}


### {250}{}{[The blood-stained field becomes filled with silence. The locals are looking at the defeated Klumk, not capable of believing their eyes. Then their gazes slowly turn to the Elder. She snaps out of it pretty fast, you should admit that] So, in his wisdom, Twilight Viper decided to show us what awaits those who don't follow his path! Klumk spent too much time around outsiders, and that made him weak! And our great spirit has sent us this... Man! And he... Stays with us! He will hunt with our warriors, share the food and show us our weaknesses! Let's greet him! [The crowd responds with an unstructured chorus of confused cheers. Elder nods to you, saying with her lips: "Say yes!"]}
{250}{}{[血迹斑斑的田野变得寂静无声。当地人看着被击败的克鲁姆克，简直不敢相信自己的眼睛。然后他们的目光慢慢转向长老。她很快就摆脱了困境，你应该承认]所以，凭借他的智慧，暮光之城毒蛇决定向我们展示等待那些不追随他的人的是什么！克鲁姆克花了太多时间和外人在一起，这让他变得软弱！我们伟大的精神把这个。。。成年男子而他。。。与我们同在！他将与我们的战士一起狩猎，分享食物，并向我们展示我们的弱点！让我们问候他！[人群以混乱的欢呼声回应。埃尔德向你点头，用嘴唇说：“答应！”]}
### {251}{026}{Oh... Oh yeah, that's how it is. Sure. Greet me. }
{251}{026}{哦哦，是的，事情就是这样。当然。请问候我。}
### {252}{021}{What?... That wasn't our deal! You want to fuck me up, bitch? I'm leaving! Right now!}
{252}{021}{什么那不是我们的交易！你想搞砸我吗，婊子？我要走了！马上}


### {260}{}{[The crowd of savages spreads up, taking away the Klumk with them. You are left alone with Elder again] Why did I do this? Am I out of my mind? Wanted a spectacle, was bored... [you didn't catch it immediately, but then it hits you - she speaks... Normal?] So, what to do with you? [she silently stares]}
{260}{}{[一群野蛮人散开了，带走了克鲁姆克人。你又和长老单独在一起了]我为什么这么做？我疯了吗？想要一个奇观，无聊。。。[你没有立即抓住它，但它击中了你――她说话……正常？]那么，你该怎么办？[她默默地凝视着]}
### {261}{027}{Wait. So it was all an act? Actually, I suspected that - you've been putting your words into sentences too good... Have my applause.}
{261}{027}{等待所以这都是一场表演？事实上，我怀疑――你把你的话写得太好了。。。请为我鼓掌。}
### {262}{027}{Ha! I knew you are just fooling these savages! Nice job with this spirits bullshit!}
{262}{027}{哈我就知道你在愚弄这些野蛮人！干得好，这些鬼东西！}


### {270}{}{[She takes off her headgear and slowly rotates her head, covered with rare silver locks] Oh, my neck is so tired from this thing... How else would you put even a single good thought into their heads? Only spirits can help. And besides, sometimes even I'm left to wonder that someone watches over me from the darkness of nights... Okay then. You got what you wanted, you can leave. And you should understand why I couldn't let you go just like that, in front of a whole tribe. So, now you are one of us. By the way - are you hungry? }
{270}{}{[她摘下头套，慢慢地转动着头，头上长满了罕见的银色头发]哦，我的脖子被这东西弄得太累了。。。否则，你怎么会在他们的脑子里想一个好主意呢？只有精神才能起作用。此外，有时甚至我也会想，有人在黑夜里看着我。。。好吧。你得到了你想要的，你可以离开。你应该明白为什么我不能在整个部落面前就这样让你走。那么，现在你是我们中的一员了。顺便问一下，你饿了吗？}
### {271}{028}{Thanks. Don't you afraid that I tell them the truth?}
{271}{028}{谢谢你不怕我告诉他们真相吗？}
### {272}{028}{No, eat human flesh by yourselves. Better tell me, what you'll give me for keeping the silence?}
{272}{028}{不，你们自己吃人肉。最好告诉我，你会因为我保持沉默而给我什么？}


### {280}{}{Who would believe you? I raised my children properly... One word of mine - and they'll rip you apart like a dead Ursa! That's it, we're done here. [she turns around to leave, but suddenly remembers something] Oh yeah! I should give you something. The sign of you being one with the tribe. Every boy becomes a man when he is given a gift from Viper. Tradition, you know... [she digs through her hides] Maracas made of twin skulls... A necklace from caravaneer teeth... No, it's too good to give away... Oh! Here, take this. It has no pictures and nothing in it makes sense. Now leave me alone, little man! [You obtained some unknown book. Elder leisurely walks off]}
{280}{}{谁会相信你？我把我的孩子抚养得很好。。。我的一句话――他们会把你像死了的大熊座一样撕裂！就这样，我们到此为止。[她转身离开，但突然想起了什么]哦，是的！我应该给你一些东西。这是你与部落融为一体的标志。当每个男孩都得到毒蛇的礼物时，他就会变成一个男人。传统，你知道。。。[她在兽皮中挖掘]由两个头骨制成的马拉卡斯。。。一条用马甲牙齿做成的项链。。。不，送人太好了。。。哦给，拿着这个。它没有图片，也没有任何意义。现在别管我，小个子！【你得到了一本不知名的书，长老悠闲地走了】}
### {281}{999}{"Constitution of 15 rights"? How the hell this ended up here?}
{281}{999}{“15项权利的宪法”？这到底是怎么回事？}
