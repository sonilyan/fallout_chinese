{100}{}{Got any spare bullets?}
{101}{}{Where did you come from?}
{102}{}{Can you help us?}
{103}{}{Talk to our leader, not me.}
{104}{}{I can't talk with you.}
{105}{}{Bother somebody else okay!}
#
{106}{}{You see: Clark.}
#
{107}{}{He's wearing a leather jacket.}
#
{108}{}{Hey there, thanks for helping us. You sure got us out of trouble. There's something I'm gonna need some help
 with, if you're willing to lend me a hand... }
{109}{}{What's the problem?}
{110}{}{I really don't have time for this.}
#the problem...
{111}{}{You see... We have been living here for a few months. We got that... thing that's recycling the air. It was
 working fine 'till a few days ago when it started making some weird noises. I don't know what the hell is wrong with
 it and I thought you might know something about repairing such stuff. Can you check it out? There's no mechanic here
 that I know of.}
{112}{}{OK, I'll see what I can do.}
{113}{}{Sorry, I'm not your maintenance guy.}
#sorry...
{114}{}{Hi there. Have you thought about repairing that old machine for me?}
{115}{}{Yep, I'm gonna check it right now.}
{116}{}{Not yet.}
#dude checked the machinery, there's a missing part...
{117}{}{Hey, you're back. Did you find out anything about that machine?}
{118}{}{Well... I've checked it and... Unfortunately, it's in very bad shape. It could stop working any time.}
{119}{}{Nothin' yet, still working on it.}
#well...
{120}{}{[Sarcastic smile.] Heh... I knew that the damn thing was broken! Is there any way to repair it?}
{121}{}{I guess I could do it, but it requires some replacement part which I’m sure will be hard to find around here.
 Know any place where I could possibly find a new air purifier?}
{122}{}{Not that I know of. You could buy a new one, somewhere...}
#require new air pirifies...
{123}{}{So, what's wrong with the old part?}
{124}{}{It seems that something is stuck inside, causing the reduced airflow and therefore increasing the pressure back
 on the pumps. But I don't have the appropriate tools to fix it.}
{125}{}{Simply, it's broken. I see no other way but to buy a new part and those must be pretty rare and costly.}
#simply broken...
{126}{}{Can you explain this. That part, it's broken but the machine can still operate, barely. Am I right?}
{127}{}{I guess so. It's just a simple filtering device. The air goes through it and nothing more.}
#
{128}{}{[Smiles.] So I can put my socks in its place, hehe. Tell you what, thanks for your help. You did what you
 could, should be enough for me to decide what to do next. I might even buy a new part. Guess I'll start searching for
 it... [Picks up his notebook.]}
{129}{}{[Leave.]}
# Tools to fix it/Some machinery part...
{130}{}{I know this old fella from Farmers Town... Quincy... He sells all kinds of stuff, and he's also a good mechanic.
 Maybe he could repair that thing. Go and tell him I sent you.}
{131}{}{Sure thing.}
# dude again, job failed...
{132}{}{Thanks for the help, but it ain't worth it.}
{133}{}{Can’t believe I'll have to buy a new part for that piece of old junk.}
{134}{}{Sure thing... You did what you could.}
{135}{}{I'm busy searching for a new part.}
#back and have repaired part...
{136}{}{Nice, I see you have brought the part. It looks like it's in much better condition than the previous one.
 Just install it back in place.}
{137}{}{Will do.}
#
{138}{}{Hmm... Yes, the air "smells" different now. So, how can I repay you for this...? [Smiles.] Ah, I remember, I got some cash, right? Hell, here's all I have, $1000 for you.}
{139}{}{Thanks, I'll be on my way.}
#
{140}{}{Thanks again!}
{141}{}{Hello there.}
{142}{}{The air is just fine!}
{143}{}{That machine is working like crazy.}
{144}{}{Thanks pal!}
{145}{}{Enough air to share!}
#
{146}{}{Have you brought that part I sent you for?}
{147}{}{Not yet.}
