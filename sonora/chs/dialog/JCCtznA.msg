### {208}{}{I remember the days when I was a puppy. Hostile tribes drove us from our former lands. Therefore, we wandered for a long time in the desert in search of a suitable place. But they found only this. Here we waited out the season of dust storms. It was a hungry time. Only the most persistent survived. Since then, two generations of puppies have grown up in these burrows.}
{208}{}{我记得我还是小狗的时候。敌对的部落把我们赶出了我们以前的土地。因此，我们在沙漠中游荡了很长一段时间，寻找一个合适的地方。但他们只发现了这个。我们在这里等待沙尘暴的季节结束。那是一段饥饿的时光。只有最执着的人才活了下来。从那时起，两代小狗就在这些洞穴里长大了。}
