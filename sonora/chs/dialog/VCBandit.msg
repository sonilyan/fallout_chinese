{253}{}{很抱歉我之所以这么问，是因为这是我第一次和局外人交谈。}
### {254}{}{I'm just wondering how you got to this life.}
{254}{}{我只是想知道你是怎么过上这种生活的。}
### {255}{}{I'm just a mercenary. Do you understand? No home, no family, no name.}

### {257}{}{Are you all so wild out there in the wastelands? Here is our Villa - one big family.}
{257}{}{你们在荒原上都那么狂野吗？这是我们的别墅――一个大家庭。}
### {258}{}{I don't know... I do not know what it means to live in a big pack like you. I probably can't do that. I won't be able to share and trust someone like myself... Damn, you better shut up before I knock your teeth out.}

{259}{}{你为什么这么生气？}
### {260}{}{Wow, it makes you angry, doesn't it?}
{260}{}{哇，这让你很生气，不是吗？}
### {261}{}{You wouldn't understand. I was found in a dumpster in a big city. The usual story. Where I come from, no one appreciates people. The population is too large, and there is nothing to do. One will disappear and no one will notice.}
{261}{}{你不会理解的。我是在一个大城市的垃圾箱里被发现的。通常的故事。在我的家乡，没有人欣赏别人。人口太多，没有什么可做的。一个人会消失，没有人会注意到。}
### {262}{}{If everything is so bad outside the Villa, then you can be understood. At least a little.}

{267}{}{等待再回答一个问题。}

### {270}{}{Why did you get involved in this business with a raid?}
{270}{}{你为什么要参与这次突袭行动？}
### {271}{}{Because I need to earn money for food. Do you understand? There was no work, and a detachment was being recruited in the camp. I just wanted to earn some light caps on this raid and then get out of here. So what? I'm here. In the fucking basement.}
{271}{}{因为我需要挣钱买食物。你明白吗？没有工作，营地里正在招募一支分遣队。我只是想在这次突袭中赚些钱，然后离开这里。那又怎样？我在这里。在他妈的地下室里。}

### {276}{}{No one would belittle a valuable employee. So you're not like that.}
{276}{}{没有人会轻视一个有价值的员工。所以你不是那样的。}
### {277}{}{Nobody cares about you. Survive as you want. I've worked in a variety of jobs, from a handyman in a bar to a slave raider. I have to earn my food somehow.}
{277}{}{没人关心你。想活多久就活多久。我做过各种各样的工作，从酒吧的杂工到奴隶掠夺者。我得设法挣点饭吃。}
### {278}{}{I see you don't like the question. Do you want to talk about it?}
{278}{}{我看你不喜欢这个问题。你想谈谈吗？}
### {279}{}{I don't want to.}
{279}{}{我不想。}
### {280}{}{Well, your right.}
{280}{}{好吧，你的权利。}
### {281}{}{In my opinion, this is an ordinary excuse for his insolvency.}
{281}{}{在我看来，这只是他无力偿债的一个普通借口。}
### {282}{}{Then shove your opinion deep up your ass.}
{282}{}{然后把你的观点深入你的屁股。}
### {283}{}{Hey, that was rude.}
{283}{}{嘿，太粗鲁了。}
### {284}{}{You're putting yourself in the frame of a bad guy to fit the environment, right?}
{284}{}{为了适应环境，你把自己放在坏人的框架里，对吧？}
### {285}{}{Damn, there's something in that. Maybe I'm just talking to the wrong people? Or maybe we should sit and think... No, I just need to shut you up. Don't forget who's in charge here.}
{285}{}{该死，里面有东西。也许我只是说错人了？或者我们应该坐下来思考...不，我只是想让你闭嘴。别忘了谁是这里的负责人。}

### {294}{}{Then you can tell it some other time.}
{294}{}{然后你可以改天说。}
### {295}{}{We made one of your guys show us the basement. They thought there was something valuable stored here. I went down first, but I fell into a trap. There was an explosion from behind, the ceiling collapsed. I lost consciousness. That's all I remember.}
{295}{}{我们让你的一个人带我们去地下室。他们认为这里有贵重物品。我先下去了，但我掉进了陷阱。后面传来爆炸声，天花板塌了。我失去了意识。我只记得这些。}
### {296}{}{Hmm, apparently it was one of my padre's traps. He arranged it just in case the Villa was seized by outsiders.}
{296}{}{嗯，显然那是我牧师的一个陷阱。他安排好了，以防别墅被外人侵占。}
### {297}{}{Did you think it was that simple? My padre has provided for the possibility of seizing the Villa.}

### {299}{}{Did you try to get out or call for help?}
{299}{}{你是想出去还是想呼救？}
### {300}{}{No one responded. These bitches just left me. I myself could not get out of the basement - the stairs were destroyed, and the exit from the cellar was locked. So... If you're here, then there's a way out somewhere, right?}
{300}{}{没有人回应。这些婊子就这样离开了我。我自己也出不去地下室――楼梯被毁了，地下室的出口也锁上了。所以…如果你在这里，那么哪里有出路，对吧？}
### {301}{}{Uh, yes, but first I need to figure something out.}
{301}{}{嗯，是的，但首先我需要想办法。}
### {302}{}{Did you find anything interesting in these cellars?}
{302}{}{你在这些地窖里发现什么有趣的东西了吗？}
### {303}{}{Nothing worth risking your own skin for. Although it's strange to see an ancient technology in such a hole. Why do you need it?}
{303}{}{没有什么值得冒着生命危险的。尽管在这样的洞里看到一种古老的技术很奇怪。你为什么需要它？}
### {304}{}{What technology are you talking about?}
{304}{}{你在说什么技术？}
### {305}{}{technology? You're delusional. The technology of the Ancients is banned in the Villa.}
{305}{}{技术你有妄想症。古人的技术在别墅里是被禁止的。}
### {306}{}{Don't you know? Long-forgotten technology in the next room. So old and decrepit that they can't even be disassembled for scrap. I wouldn't be surprised if you secretly worship these pieces of iron.}
{306}{}{你不知道吗？被遗忘已久的技术在隔壁房间。它们又旧又破旧，甚至不能拆卸报废。如果你偷偷崇拜这些铁片，我不会感到惊讶。}
### {307}{}{Nonsense. Why does the padre hide forbidden items from us? He swears himself when something is brought from the wasteland.}
{307}{}{胡说为什么牧师对我们隐藏违禁物品？当有人从荒原上带来什么东西时，他会咒骂自己。}
### {308}{}{You say it's just garbage? You must have confused something.}
{308}{}{你说这只是垃圾？你一定搞混了什么。}
### {309}{}{How should I know? You're the one who lives here. But if your leader hides what he forbids, I would stop trusting him.}
{309}{}{我该怎么知道？你就是住在这里的人。但如果你的领导人隐瞒了他所禁止的，我就不会再信任他了。}
### {310}{}{Surely he has an explicable reason. But that's not the main thing right now.}

### {311}{}{Don't you dare speak ill of my father. Understand?}
{311}{}{你不敢说我父亲的话。懂}
### {312}{}{I don't know. My specialty is not to understand hardware, but to hit them in the jaw.}

{322}{}{你为什么要攻击我们？你想从收获中获利吗？}
### {323}{}{Damn barbarians. Are you only capable of robberies, or are you at least of some use?}
{323}{}{该死的野蛮人。你是只会抢劫，还是至少有点用处？}
### {324}{}{Stupid peasant, you... (mocks you, but then clears his throat bitterly) You don't even have the slightest idea about the outside world, do you? Your tribesmen were taken to work in the mine. Although I don't think you know what it is.}
{324}{}{愚蠢的农民，你...（嘲笑你，然后痛苦地清了清嗓子）你对外面的世界一点都不了解，是吗？你的部落成员被带到矿井里工作。虽然我想你不知道它是什么。}
