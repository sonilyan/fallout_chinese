{116}{}{哦，不！这里的一切都那么熟悉，我有厚厚的墙和熟悉的人。至于外面，我甚至不敢去想。}

#{124}{}{You've never even left the vault?!}
{124}{}{你从没离开过保险库？！}
#{125}{}{No, I have, of course, a couple of times. I just... Stood near the exit, looking out into the desert and... I couldn't take the burning sun... The constantly changing sky... And the space! So much open, empty space! It's scary and dangerous! If I could, I'd rather stay in the vault forever.}
{125}{}{不，我当然有几次。我只是...站在出口附近，望向沙漠...我无法忍受烈日...不断变化的天空...还有空间！这么多空旷的地方！这既可怕又危险！如果可以的话，我宁愿永远呆在避难所里。}

#{152}{}{Yes, thanks to you I'm not afraid to go outside anymore. Thank you so much for this!}
{152}{}{是的，多亏了你，我再也不怕出去了。非常感谢你！}
#{153}{}{Doctor Willmouth says there's only one way to overcome your fears, and that's to face them. So here I am, trying. Every day I get more used to being outside. Doctor Willmouth is so smart!}
{153}{}{威尔茅斯医生说只有一种方法可以克服你的恐惧，那就是面对它们。所以我在这里，努力。每天我都越来越习惯在外面。威尔茅斯医生真聪明！}
#{154}{}{Right. Can you tell me what happened while I was away?}
{154}{}{正确的。你能告诉我我不在的时候发生了什么事吗？}
#{155}{}{I... Don't know what to say. I rarely speak to anyone, but... I feel like something isn't right. But maybe it's just my imagination.}
{155}{}{一、 ...不知道该说什么。我很少和任何人说话，但是...我觉得有些不对劲。但也许这只是我的想象。}
#{156}{}{What are you talking about?}
{156}{}{你在说什么？}
#{157}{}{I've heard that people are going missing. Not like you did - they're just... Gone. The Overseer and the guards don't tell us anything. Maybe they just don't want people to panic, but they're supposed to protect us. Keeping us completely in the dark is... Strange.}
{157}{}{我听说有人失踪了。不像你那样-他们只是...跑了。监工和警卫什么都不告诉我们。也许他们只是不想让人们恐慌，但他们应该保护我们。把我们完全蒙在鼓里是...奇怪。}
