We went through so much - just for you to get smoked here... Where's the fucking righteousness in that? [he notices you] And the life goes on. What brings you here, man?}
{1005}{}{[沮丧地看了一眼，他在房间里徘徊，悄悄地喃喃自语。你走近一点。]猪。。。这是怎么发生的，兄弟？我们经历了这么多-只是为了让你在这里抽烟。。。那他妈的正义在哪里？[他注意到你了]生活还在继续。是什么把你带到这里来的，伙计？}

### {115}{999}{Actually, I've got to go.}
{115}{999}{事实上，我得走了。}


### {120}{}{[he eagerly grabs the batteries] Rainbow, you ask? Rainbow is the best place in the whole Radius, man! Here you can find everything a free man needs. In our neighborhood, you can come by Apothecary's bar and pop some stuff or get booze. Also, we make the Drop here - you should check it out. It hits you like a sledgehammer! Good stuff. If you want to shed some blood and make some money, then Arena is at your service. Look to the east of the central square. By the way, it's the place where most of our guys like to hang out, so - behave.}
{120}{}{[他急切地抓起电池]彩虹，你问？彩虹是整个半径中最好的地方，伙计！在这里你可以找到一个自由人所需要的一切。在我们附近，你可以来到药剂师的酒吧，喝点东西或喝酒。此外，我们在这里制作Drop-您应该查看一下。它像大锤一样砸在你身上！好东西。如果你想流血赚钱，Arena随时为你服务。往中央广场的东面看。顺便说一句，这里是我们大多数人喜欢闲逛的地方，所以要规矩。}
### {121}{013}{Okay. What about the local authorities? You probably have some serious people in charge here.}
{121}{013}{可以地方当局呢？这里可能有一些严肃的负责人。}
### {122}{999}{Thanks for the info. Take care, Shepherd.}
{122}{999}{谢谢你提供的信息。小心，谢泼德。}


### {130}{}{[he quickly counts and hides batteries] Well, actually, nobody's in charge. But everyone pays my man Hog for protection. He is an extremely serious fella, we're like brothers. We've been through so much shit together, you wouldn't believe it. Had so much fun in raids while in Jackals... Then the Hog has Mate, that shaved motherfucking asshole, who thinks he's cool. You just keep in mind that he looks after the supply of raw materials for the laboratory and deals with issues that Hog does not. And there's Apothecary - he owns a bar and controls the quality of the Drop. He is pretty good at chemistry... When not wasted.}
{130}{}{[他迅速数了数，把电池藏起来]实际上，没人管。但每个人都付钱给我的人霍格保护。他是一个非常严肃的家伙，我们就像兄弟一样。我们一起经历了这么多，你不会相信的。在《豺狼》中，我们在突袭中玩得很开心。。。然后猪有了伙伴，那个剃光胡子的混蛋，他觉得自己很酷。你只需要记住，他负责实验室的原材料供应，并处理霍格没有处理的问题。还有药剂师――他拥有一家酒吧，并控制着滴剂的质量。他化学很好。。。没有浪费的时候。}
### {131}{014}{What did you say about the Jackals?}
{131}{014}{你怎么说豺狼？}
### {132}{012}{Can you tell me more about the Rainbow?}
{132}{012}{你能告诉我更多关于彩虹的事吗？}
### {133}{999}{Understood. That's all I wanted. See you!}
{133}{999}{明白了。这就是我想要的。再见}


### {140}{}{[he spits on the floor] They are just a bunch of pussies. After we left them, the Jackals became nothing. Now there's Loudmouth in charge, and he is pretty fucked up. Thinks he has the longest dick in the Radius, ha! Why do you think they call him that? Because he was pissing his pants and whining non-stop as a child. His father, Jackal, was... A good boss, but a terrible parent. He fucked up his son, even with turning him into a real Jackal in the end. This loud asshole cut off Hog's finger just for kicks, can you imagine? So, when we got tired of this hysterical bitch, we moved here. Took care of every annoying shit, built the Hog's crib, the bar...  Basically, started to live as white people. Especially me! [he happily laughs]}
{140}{}{[他在地板上吐唾沫]他们只是一群胆小鬼。在我们离开他们之后，豺狼一家什么都没有了。现在有了Loudmouth负责，他真是一团糟。认为他有半径中最长的老二，哈！你认为他们为什么这么称呼他？因为他小时候尿裤子，不停地抱怨。他的父亲，豺狼，是。。。一个好老板，但一个糟糕的父母。他把儿子搞砸了，甚至最后把他变成了一个真正的豺狼。你能想象吗？这个大声的混蛋为了踢腿而割下了霍格的手指？所以，当我们厌倦了这个歇斯底里的婊子，我们搬到了这里。处理每一件烦人的事，建造猪的婴儿床，酒吧。。。基本上，开始以白人的身份生活。尤其是我！[他开心地笑着]}
### {141}{999}{Thanks for the info. See you around.}
{141}{999}{谢谢你提供的信息。回头见。}


### {1501}{}{[he gets more lively] Now we're talking business! Here's how it is, man - for only 27 batteries per hour, the best pussies in Radius are at your service! Do anything you want with them, but don't mess up the commodity's condition, be so kind. They won't say no, I promise you that. I work on them myself... In every hole, hahaha! And don't forget the condoms - it's on the house.}
{1501}{}{[他变得更活泼了]现在我们在谈生意！事情是这样的，伙计――每小时只需27节电池，Radius最好的猫咪随时为您服务！用它们做任何你想做的事，但不要把商品的状况搞砸，要友善。他们不会说不，我向你保证。我自己做。。。在每一个洞里，哈哈哈！别忘了避孕套――它在房子上。}
### {151}{999}{Such a good recommendation! I'm paying!}
{151}{999}{这么好的推荐！我在付钱！}
### {152}{999}{No, I don't need it for now.}
{152}{999}{不，我现在不需要它。}
### {1502}{}{Our fine establishment is always at your service, man! The price still stands - 27 batteries per hour.}
{1502}{}{我们的精品店随时为您服务，伙计！价格仍然是每小时27节电池。}
### {153}{999}{Let's do it!}
{153}{999}{让我们来做吧！}
### {154}{999}{Maybe some other time.}
{154}{999}{也许改天吧。}
### {1503}{}{You won't regret it, chief, I tell you! [he shouts to one of his girls] Hey you!! Prepare those two new ones I left for myself! Our boss is doing us the honors! }
{1503}{}{你不会后悔的，首领，我告诉你！[他对他的一个女儿喊道]嘿，你！！准备好我留给自己的那两个新的！我们的老板在给我们荣誉！}
### {155}{999}{We'll see about that... Give me the rubbers and you can go.}
{155}{999}{我们拭目以待。。。把橡胶给我，你就可以走了。}


### {1601}{}{Actually, yes. I might use some help. [he stares at you for a while, then continues] I've been having troubles with security in my establishment lately. Some assholes are periodically coming around, four of them. In their last visit, one of my girls ended up being torn, another had her face worked with a blade. And that means I'm having additional costs! Fuck, I couldn't get a boner for a couple of days, that's how sad I was! Of course, I could tell Hog about it, but I suspect that he would send Mate to deal with it - and I have my beef with Mate. So, will you handle the scumbags? They actually just came in... }
{1601}{}{事实上，是的。我可能需要一些帮助。[他盯着你看了一会儿，然后继续说道]我最近在我的机构里遇到了安全问题。一些混蛋会定期出现，其中有四个。在她们最后一次来访时，我的一个女儿被撕裂了，另一个女儿的脸被刀片刮伤了。这意味着我有额外的费用！操，我几天都吃不到骨头了，这就是我有多难过！当然，我可以告诉Hog这件事，但我怀疑他会派Mate来处理这件事――我和Mate有意见。那么，你会处理这些卑鄙小人吗？他们实际上只是进来了。。。}
### {161}{999}{Deal. Wait here.}
{161}{999}{处理在这里等着。}
### {162}{011}{Not interested. Better answer me some questions.}
{162}{011}{不感兴趣。最好回答我一些问题。}
### {163}{999}{I need to think about it. Will be back.}
{163}{999}{我需要考虑一下。我会回来的。}
### {1602}{}{There's one thing that's bugging me. A guard of the local warehouse, named Brick. This horny piece of Lavash shit has a habit of visiting my girls - and he fucks them for free! Backs them into a corner and bonks them right there. How do you like that? Now, man, please, deal with him, I ask you like a brother. Apothecary supplied me with some chemical stuff to loosen up, but I'm willing to give it to you, only for that freak not to be around anymore! }
{1602}{}{有一件事困扰着我。当地仓库的一个名叫Brick的警卫。这个色情的熔岩大便有拜访我女儿的习惯――他免费操她们！把他们背到一个角落里，然后把他们扔到那里。你觉得怎么样？现在，伙计，请处理他，我像兄弟一样问你。药剂师给我提供了一些化学物质来放松，但我愿意把它给你，只为了那个怪胎不在身边了！}
### {164}{999}{Deal. Get the stuff ready.}
{164}{999}{处理把东西准备好。}
### {165}{011}{Nah, handle him yourself. And I need answers to some questions.}
{165}{011}{不，你自己处理他。我需要一些问题的答案。}
### {166}{999}{I need to think about it. Will be back.}
{166}{999}{我需要考虑一下。我会回来的。}
### {1603}{}{[he nods] There are actually four scumbags... When they came around last time, one of my girls ended up being torn, and another had her face worked with a blade. This not only means that I'm having additional costs - it's disrespectful to you, chief!! I would impale them on some stick myself, but I know how you like to personally break the bones of such disrespectful pricks!}
{1603}{}{[他点点头]实际上有四个卑鄙小人。。。上次他们来的时候，我的一个女儿被撕裂了，另一个女儿的脸被刀片刮伤了。这不仅意味着我有额外的费用――这是对你的不尊重，酋长！！我会自己把它们刺在棍子上，但我知道你是多么喜欢亲自折断这种无礼的刺的骨头！}
### {167}{999}{Ha! You are quite right. Are they here now? Good - it's time to shed some blood...}
{167}{999}{哈你说得很对。他们现在在这里吗？很好，是时候流血了。。。}
### {168}{999}{What? I don't do such petty shit. You should deal with matters like this yourself! That's it, I'm busy, See you!}
{168}{999}{什么我不做这种琐碎的事。这样的事情你应该自己处理！就这样，我很忙，再见！}
### {1604}{}{[he sends a chewed toothpick flying into the nearest prostitute] I don't even feel comfortable distracting you with such petty matters... There's one of your guys, a guard of the local warehouse whose name's Brick. This horny piece of Lavash shit has a habit of visiting my girls - and he fucks them for free!! Backs them into a corner and bonks them right there. How do you like that? Help me, chief, I'm pretty busy lately - trying to make more money for you!}
{1604}{}{[他把一根嚼过的牙签飞到最近的妓女身上]我甚至觉得用这些小事分散你的注意力都不舒服。。。有一个你的人，当地仓库的警卫，他的名字叫Brick。这个色情的熔岩大便有拜访我女儿的习惯――他免费操她们！！把他们背到一个角落里，然后把他们扔到那里。你觉得怎么样？帮帮我，头儿，我最近很忙，想给你赚更多的钱！}
### {169}{999}{Okay, I'll see to it. And you should think about why would I need someone who can't handle his own matters.}
{169}{999}{好吧，我会处理的。你应该想想，为什么我需要一个不能处理自己事情的人。}
### {1610}{999}{And you will pay in time, I don't even doubt. As for the Brick - I don't have time for this, hear me? Later.}
{1610}{999}{我毫不怀疑你会及时付款的。至于砖块，我没有时间，听到了吗？后来}
### {1604}{}{Nah, everything's quiet. All good, man.}
{1604}{}{不，一切都很安静。一切都好，伙计。}
### {1611}{999}{Okay. Tell me if you need anything. Later, Shepherd.}
{1611}{999}{可以如果你需要什么，告诉我。后来，谢泼德。}
### {1605}{}{[he scratches his nose with a toothpick] Chief, you are so good at dealing with this kind of shit, I can't believe it! We are so lucky to have you in charge! Everything is great, no problem at all!}
{1605}{}{[他用牙签挠鼻子]科长，你这么会处理这种事，我简直不敢相信！我们很幸运有你负责！一切都很好，一点问题都没有！}
### {1612}{999}{Good. But you should learn to handle the matters by yourself because you are responsible. Later, Shepherd.}
{1612}{999}{好的但是你应该学会自己处理事情，因为你有责任心。后来，谢泼德。}
### {1606}{}{Actually, yes. I might use some help. [he stares at you for a while, then continues] I've been having troubles with security in my establishment lately.

And that means I'm having additional costs! Fuck, I couldn't get a boner for a couple of days, that's how sad I was! As Hog went down, all this filth doesn't let me do my business! And Mate is so happy about it, that smug asshole...  So, will you handle the scumbags? They just came in...}
{1606}{}{事实上，是的。我可能需要一些帮助。[他盯着你看了一会儿，然后继续说道]我最近在我的机构里遇到了安全问题。一些混蛋会定期出现，其中有四个。在她们最后一次来访时，我的一个女儿被撕裂了，另一个女儿的脸被刀片刮伤了。这意味着我有额外的费用！操，我几天都吃不到骨头了，这就是我有多难过！当霍格倒下的时候，所有这些肮脏的东西都不让我做我的事！Mate对此非常高兴，那个自鸣得意的混蛋。。。那么，你会处理这些卑鄙小人吗？他们刚进来。。。}

### {200}{}{[He stares at you with his bulging, red eyes]  You... Who do you think you are fucking with, bitch? Do you know what Hog will do to you? Screw this, you know what I will do to you? I'll show you!}
{200}{}{[他瞪着红肿的眼睛看着你]你。。。你以为你和谁在一起，婊子？你知道霍格会对你做什么吗？去他妈的，你知道我会对你做什么吗？我给你看！}
### {201}{998}{Come on, you scum! I will dissect your face right to the back of your head!}
{201}{998}{来吧，你们这些渣滓！我会把你的脸一直解剖到你的后脑勺！}
### {202}{998}{As the blind man once said - let's see! Come and get it!}
{202}{998}{正如盲人曾经说过的那样――让我们看看！快来拿！}


### {2101}{}{The business is going great, chief! The last batch of girls we got is just sweet, can't say it better. [he strokes his greasy hair] And a lot of them come to us by their own will, because they want your protection! All I have to do is to count the incoming batteries.}
{2101}{}{生意做得很好，头儿！我们得到的最后一批女孩很可爱，说得再好不过了。[他抚摸着油腻的头发]他们中的很多人是自愿来找我们的，因为他们想要你的保护！我所要做的就是数电池的数量。}
### {211}{022}{And how much did you count? Have something for me?}
{211}{022}{你数了多少？有什么给我的吗？}
### {2102}{}{[he grabs his head] Everything is fucked... Some assholes beat the shit out of me and left without paying. The bitches are running away... I just can't handle it alone, man. Hog, why did you kick the bucket, brother... }
{2102}{}{[他抓着头]一切都糟透了。。。有些混蛋打了我一顿，没付钱就走了。婊子们正在逃跑。。。我一个人处理不了，伙计。猪，你为什么要踢水桶，兄弟。。。}
### {212}{999}{It could be worse. Hang in there. }
{212}{999}{情况可能会更糟。坚持住。}


### {2201}{}{[he opens his little portable safe] All here, chief, down to the last battery!}

### {222}{999}{I won't forget that. Later.}
{222}{999}{我不会忘记的。后来}


### {2301}{}{[You see a girl running at you, screaming. As you stumble, she gets behind your back, cowering in fear. The black guy stops nearby, gasping for air, then tosses a toothpick into his mouth.] What the... Don't get in my way, man. I'm going to beat the shit out of this bitch's stupid head! Or better, help me to capture her!}
{2301}{}{[你看到一个女孩朝你跑来，尖叫着。当你绊倒时，她躲在你身后，吓得畏缩。那个黑人停在附近，大口大口地喘着粗气，然后把牙签扔到嘴里。]什么。。。别挡我的路，伙计。我要把这个婊子愚蠢的脑袋打得屁滚尿流！或者更好的是，帮我抓住她！}
### {231}{024}{What's this all about?}
{231}{024}{这是怎么回事？}
### {2302}{}{[You see a girl running at you, screaming. As you stumble, she behind your back, cowering in fear. Shepherd stops nearby, gasping for air, tossing a toothpick into his mouth.]}
{2302}{}{[你看到一个女孩朝你跑来，尖叫着。当你跌倒时，她背在你身后，吓得畏缩。牧羊人在附近停了下来，大口地喘着粗气，把一根牙签扔进嘴里。]}
### {232}{024}{What's this all about?}
{232}{024}{这是怎么回事？}


### {240}{}{I treated this slut like no other! I didn't even punch her face while fucking her! The clients liked her! And what she does in return? She starts fucking stealing! And you know why? Because of her fucking dad's meds! She tried to talk the caravan merchants into this, ain't it fucked up? Of course, they ratted her out - they are our regular customers! It's alright - if she survives after me, she'll learn some respect! [The girl squeals and covers her face] Get her, man!}
{240}{}{我对待这个荡妇是独一无二的！我连打她的脸都没打！客户喜欢她！她做了什么作为回报？她开始偷东西！你知道为什么吗？因为她他妈的爸爸的药！她试图说服商队商人，不是搞砸了吗？当然，他们出卖了她――他们是我们的老顾客！没关系――如果她在我之后幸存下来，她会得到一些尊重的！[女孩尖叫着掩面]抓住她，伙计！}
### {241}{025}{Just a second! [grab the girl] Damn, ain't she a feisty one! Hold her, don't stand there! Things like this shouldn't be forgiven, so don't go easy on her. Thieves used to have their hands cut off, or so I've heard...}
{241}{025}{等一下！[抓住女孩]妈的，她不是个好动的人吗！抱着她，不要站在那里！这样的事情不应该被原谅，所以不要对她宽容。小偷过去常常被砍断双手，或者我听说。。。}
### {242}{026}{Hey, easy! This can be resolved without any fuss!}
{242}{026}{嘿，轻松！这个问题可以不用大惊小怪地解决！}
### {243}{027}{You won't touch her, black boy. [stand in his way]}
{243}{027}{你不会碰她的，黑人男孩。[挡住他的路]}


### {250}{}{[The pimp skillfully ties the hands of the resisting girl with a rope, then puts a noose on her neck] You know, she doesn't need hands to work... Thanks for the tip, by the way! Don't you worry, I'll deal with her very thoroughly. You should come to visit us, man. I won't promise any discounts, sorry, but at least the girls won't be contagious, haha! [pulls the rope] Move, bitch! }
{250}{}{[皮条客熟练地用绳子绑住反抗女孩的手，然后在她的脖子上套上套索]你知道，她不需要手。。。顺便说一句，谢谢你的小费！别担心，我会彻底处理她的。你应该来拜访我们，伙计。对不起，我不会承诺任何折扣，但至少女孩们不会传染，哈哈！[拉绳子]走开，婊子！}
### {251}{999}{You don't trust anyone these days... Okay, I overstayed my welcome. I should go.}
{251}{999}{这些天你不信任任何人。。。好吧，我逾期不受欢迎了。我该走了。}


### {260}{}{[he is staring at you astonished, with his mouth open. His toothpick is stuck on his lower lip.] What? What the hell are you blabbering about? How else would you deal with this?}
{260}{}{[他张着嘴惊讶地盯着你。他的牙签卡在下唇上。]什么？你到底在说什么？否则你会怎么处理？}
### {261}{}{Be more practical! You said yourself that she is a valuable employee. And she is already terrified - look, she's barely standing. Why do you need to lose part of your income? Just remind her about this matter from time to time, and she will work even harder than before. }
{261}{}{更实际一点！你说过她是一个有价值的员工。她已经吓坏了――看，她几乎站不起来了。为什么你需要损失部分收入？只要不时提醒她这件事，她就会比以前更加努力。}
### {262}{025}{You know, maybe you're right! [grab the girl] Hold her legs! Ow! I'm going to rip your arms off, you slut!}
{262}{025}{你知道，也许你是对的！[抓住女孩]抓住她的腿！噢我要扯下你的胳膊，你这个荡妇！}
### {263}{027}{How, you ask? One-on-one. With me.}
{263}{027}{你问，怎么办？一对一。和我在一起。}


### {2701}{}{[Suddenly, the pimp throws himself at you. What he tried to do - attack you or grab the girl - will always remain a mystery, because he trips over, falls down, and hits the floor with his head so hard that you hear loud cracking. The girl stands frozen with her mouth agape, then sets a new world record on high-pitched yelling and hastily vanishes around the corner. You check the pimp's body for signs of life, but his broken neck indicates that he has definitely kicked the bucket.]}
{2701}{}{[突然，皮条客扑向你。他试图做什么――攻击你或抓住女孩――永远是个谜，因为他绊倒了，摔倒了，头重重地撞在地板上，你会听到巨大的爆裂声。女孩目瞪口呆地站在那里，然后创造了一项新的高音喊叫世界纪录，然后匆匆消失在拐角处。你检查皮条客的身体是否有生命迹象，但他的脖子骨折表明他肯定踢了桶。]}
### {271}{999}{How's that even happened? And what should I say if someone asks?}
{271}{999}{这是怎么发生的？如果有人问我该怎么说？}
### {2702}{}{[He approaches you, grotesquely waving his hands] Oh, so we have a hero among us! A holy savior of poor prostitutes! Do you know what Hog will do to you if you lay a finger on me? You know what, asshole, I'm going to kill you myself, and then fuck this bitch on your cold corpse! Hear me?! [the girl is definitely waiting for the moment to sprint away from the place of conflict.]}
{2702}{}{[他走近你，奇怪地挥舞着双手]哦，所以我们中间有一个英雄！可怜妓女的神圣救世主！你知道如果你对我动手动脚，猪会对你做什么吗？你知道吗，混蛋，我要亲手杀了你，然后在你冰冷的尸体上操这个婊子！听到了吗？！[女孩肯定在等待逃离冲突地点的时机。]}
### {272}{998}{So much talking... Let's see what you are made of.}
{272}{998}{聊了这么多。。。让我们看看你是由什么组成的。}
### {273}{998}{I'm going to make a meatball out of your innards and shove it very deep into your black ass! And she gets your black balls as a souvenir! }
{273}{998}{我要用你的内脏做一个肉丸，把它深深地塞进你的黑屁股里！她还得到了你的黑球作为纪念品！}
### {274}{028}{[Heated by conversation, your opponent doesn't even think about defending himself. It's time to attack!]}
{274}{028}{[由于谈话激烈，你的对手甚至不会考虑为自己辩护。是时候进攻了！]}


### {280}{}{[Your blow is so fast that the enemy didn't even notice it. With the palm of your hand, you punch his nose cartilage right into his brain. The pimp falls down like a sack of flour, twitches his leg for the last time - and stops moving. His unseeing eyes are staring into nothingness. You look around, but the girl is nowhere to be found.]}
{280}{}{[你的打击如此之快，以至于敌人都没有注意到。你用手掌将他的鼻子软骨直接打进他的大脑。皮条客像一袋面粉一样倒下，最后一次抽搐他的腿，然后停止了移动。他那双看不见的眼睛凝视着虚无。你环顾四周，却找不到那个女孩。]}
### {281}{999}{Not even a thank you... Okay, what's done is done.}
{281}{999}{连一句谢谢都没有。。。好吧，已经完成了。}

### {285}{}{Armed raiders kindly escort you to their boss, pointing their guns in your back.}
{285}{}{武装袭击者好心地护送你去见他们的老板，用枪指着你的后背。}
