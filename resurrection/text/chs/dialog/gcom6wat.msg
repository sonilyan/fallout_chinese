#{600}{}{Caution! The connection with the central computer of the reactor has been lost. The device can not guarantee the correct rate of regulation! The failure is not in the fully self-sufficient reactor cooling device 6002, Wattz Electronics will thus not accept any responsibility for possible damage.}
{600}{}{小心！与反应堆中央计算机的连接中断了。装置不能保证正确的调节率！故障不在完全自给自足的6002反应堆冷却装置内，华特电子因此对可能造成的损坏不承担任何责任。}
