### {10}{}{[you see a giant man. Not much taller than you, but he's very well-built. Also, his fist is as big as three of yours. Looking at him you suddenly remember the tale about a green ogre, which your mother used to tell you before bedtime. His face looks pretty simple - like the one of an orangutan solving the equation. You notice a pre-war badge of a supermarket employee on his leather jacket. It says "Stan".]}
