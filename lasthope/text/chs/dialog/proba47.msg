{100}{}{You see: an old farmer.}
#1
{101}{}{Hello there, kid. Haven't seen strangers for years. But can't really talk right now, I'm in a big hurry. My damn
 plow broke down, then my shovel went missing, and now I'm not gonna finish my gardening on time. I can barely walk
 and now this... Ugh. Hey, kid... [Looking at you.] Wanna help an old fella?}
#1
{102}{}{Sure thing oldie... What do you need?}
{103}{}{I'll be back later.}
#1
{104}{}{Well, these old legs of mine won't let me stand up and walk around no more. I can work my field alright,
 years of hard work got me used to that, but anything else... [sighs] and there's no way for me to survive without my
 harvest. It's all I got. So listen, kid, I need a shovel, any kind will do just fine. If you find one or buy me a new one, I
 will be forever grateful. I really don't have any money to pay for it, but if it means something to you I could give you
 some food or something to drink because it's all I got and all I ever needed.}
{105}{}{I will return when I've found you a shovel.}
#1
{106}{}{Hey, sonny, have you brought me the shovel?}
#1
{107}{}{No, sir, still looking.}
#1
{108}{}{Yep, I got it, it's right here... [Show him the shovel.]}
#1
{109}{}{My goodness, what a nice shovel! Thank you so much. Here's some fruits from my garden. They are really
 fresh. You're gonna feel great after eating them.}
#1
{110}{}{Thanks, oldie. See ya later.}
#2
{111}{}{You know, sonny, that shovel has really helped me. But I have a problem with my well. The water is pouring
 out every time I try to take some of it. It's the bucket, it's seriously messed up. I tried to fix it myself, but I'm too old
 for that. What's worse the bucket rope got untied and fell down into the well while I was messing with it. Now... I need
 a new rope and someone to fix the well. Please, I need that water or my plants are gonna get dry and die. Can you find
 a new rope for me, sonny?}
#2
{112}{}{Yeah, I can do that.}
{113}{}{Nah, I'm really busy right now.}
#2
{114}{}{Have you fixed the well?}
#2
{115}{}{Yep, it's done. Your well is working fine now.}
#2
{116}{}{No luck yet, still needs a rope.}
#2
{117}{}{Fresh water from the well, just reminds me of the old days when I was just about your age. Hehe... You made
 this old man happy like nobody else has for quite some time! This was a real favor, kid. Here's some money I
 managed to collect. For your trouble. [Smiling.] Fine job indeed, sonny!}
#3
{118}{}{Howdy, sonny! Nice to see you again. Hey, this old fella heard that some flowers could be used to make
 some powerful healing stuff. If this is really true, I want to try it myself. When I was younger I used to study chemicals
 and potions. Ooh, the old times... Yeah, there was one time I made an antidote for radscorpion poison! As I remember,
 I used the very poison from the scorpion's tail. Folks around know that and they are asking me to make some antidote
 for them... all the time. But I need a larger number of those "broc" flowers and a sample of radscorpion poison. Could
 you get me five flowers and about three scorpion tails?}
#3
{119}{}{You got it, grandpa.}
{120}{}{Not now, grandpa. I'm in a hurry.}
#3
{121}{}{Did you bring me some broc flowers and poison samples?}
#3
{122}{}{No, still looking.}
#3
{123}{}{Yep, I got 'em right here. Here you go.}
#3
{124}{}{Thatta boy! [Examines the flowers.] Very nice specimens. These fine folks gonna appreciate it, I'd
 better get down to work. Hey! I got some old bullets, I don't need 'em. Maybe you could sell 'em or somethin', I'm
 sure you'll get some money for them. Until next time, farewell, sonny.}
#3
{125}{}{Thanks, oldie, take care.}

{126}{}{Get away from me, thief!}
{127}{}{You better run away before I shoot you.}
{128}{}{No, sonny... I can't trust you anymore.}
{129}{}{Damn you... You better run. Town's gonna give it to you!}
