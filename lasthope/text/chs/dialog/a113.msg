### {120}{}{What can you tell me about this place?}
{120}{}{关于这个地方你能告诉我什么？}
### {121}{}{Nothing, thanks for your time.}
{121}{}{没什么，谢谢你抽出时间。}
### {122}{}{Most of the locals are workers. Some are still working in the mine, others left town or turned to more profitable jobs like trading. I was a miner once, but I've survived a great tragedy in the mine and promised myself never to work down there again. Later, with the help of the sheriff, I opened this bar. However, I've been concerned lately...}
{122}{}{大多数当地人都是工人。一些人仍在矿场工作，另一些人则离开了小镇，转而从事贸易等利润更高的工作。我曾经是一名矿工，但我在矿井里度过了一场巨大的悲剧，并承诺不再在那里工作。后来，在警长的帮助下，我开了这家酒吧。然而，我最近一直很担心。。。}
### {123}{}{What about that tragedy in the mine?}
{123}{}{矿井里的悲剧怎么办？}
### {124}{}{What are you concerned about?}
{124}{}{你担心什么？}
### {125}{}{You said some locals left the town, where to?}
{125}{}{你说一些当地人离开了小镇，去哪里？}
### {126}{}{Sorry, I have something else to do. Thanks for the story.}
{126}{}{对不起，我还有别的事要做。谢谢你的报道。}
### {127}{}{I'd rather not talk about it, but I'll tell you one thing. That mine isn't safe anymore, it never was, but it's more prone to collapsing than it was some thirty years ago. Especially in the last ten years the mine has expanded so rapidly... it just can't support the drilling anymore.}
{127}{}{我不想谈论它，但我要告诉你一件事。那座矿井已经不安全了，从来都不是，但它比大约三十年前更容易坍塌。尤其是在过去的十年里，矿山扩张如此之快。。。它再也不能支撑钻井了。}
### {128}{}{I see, what about those who still work down there?}
{128}{}{我明白了，那些还在那里工作的人呢？}
### {129}{}{Interesting. I must go now. Thanks for the story.}
{129}{}{有趣的我现在必须走了。谢谢你的故事。}
### {130}{}{This town is losing population at an alarming rate. If this trend continues, I will not only lose all my customers, but the place itself will become a ghost town. I'm not very optimistic...}
{130}{}{这个城镇的人口正在以惊人的速度减少。如果这种趋势继续下去，我不仅会失去所有的顾客，而且这个地方本身也会变成一座鬼城。我不是很乐观。。。}
### {131}{}{I admit it doesn't look good. Let me ask you something else.}
{131}{}{我承认它看起来不太好。让我再问你一件事。}
### {132}{}{So it's that bad... Look, I have to go now, we'll talk some other time.}
{132}{}{所以它是那么糟糕。。。听着，我现在得走了，我们改天再谈。}
### {133}{}{Far away from here, that's for sure. Many died in the wasteland. [Sighs.] They just weren't ready for the world out there. We could talk more about this but there's no point. I'll get back to my work now. Please, enjoy your stay in my bar.}
{133}{}{离这里很远，这是肯定的。许多人死在荒地上。他们只是没有为外面的世界做好准备。我们可以多谈谈这个，但没有意义。我现在就回去工作。请在我的酒吧里过得愉快。}
### {134}{}{I will, see you later Jacob.}
{134}{}{我会的，再见，雅各布。}
### {135}{}{Well, they know the risk, it is a dangerous job. I'm guessing they pray every night to a higher power because no one else listens. Some have no choice, others had to move on because they couldn't support their families anymore. The sheriff did everything in his power to help but this town depends very much on the mine's income. I even heard rumors about closing the mine because the coal reserves are, they think, running very low. If that happens, this town will be finished.}
{135}{}{他们知道风险，这是一项危险的工作。我猜他们每晚都向更高的力量祈祷，因为没有其他人听。有些人别无选择，另一些人因为无法再养家糊口而不得不离开。警长尽其所能提供帮助，但这个小镇在很大程度上依赖于矿山的收入。我甚至听到了关闭煤矿的传言，因为他们认为煤炭储量非常低。如果真的发生了，这个小镇就完了。}
### {136}{}{I hope it won't be that way. Let me ask you something else instead.}
{136}{}{我希望不会那样。让我问你一些别的问题。}
### {137}{}{It does look like a tricky situation. I'll be going now, thanks for your time.}
{137}{}{这看起来确实是一个棘手的情况。我现在就走，谢谢你抽出时间。}
### {138}{}{Alright, just keep in mind this is a bar not a chat room. So, you want to order something?}
{138}{}{好吧，记住这是酒吧而不是聊天室。那么，你想点什么吗？}
### {139}{}{Well, I'm glad to see you again. What would it be this time?}
{139}{}{很高兴再次见到你。这次会是什么？}
### {140}{}{Nothing.}
{140}{}{没有什么}
### {141}{}{I don't serve your kind.}
{141}{}{我不为你服务。}
### {142}{}{Sorry, I'm closed!}
{142}{}{对不起，我关门了！}
### {143}{}{You'll have to try somewhere else.}
{143}{}{你得去别的地方试试。}
### {144}{}{No, I can't help you.}
{144}{}{不，我帮不了你。}
### {145}{}{You have to pay for that.}
{145}{}{你必须为此付出代价。}
### {146}{}{I'll be back with some money.}
{146}{}{我会带些钱回来的。}
### {147}{}{Anything else?}
{147}{}{还有别的吗？}
