#{114}{}{I'm corporal Dickens and I write this entry for those who will get into the garrison after us. Today is the 25 of october, 2077. Yesterday the city of Hawthorne was subjected to a massive nuclear attack from the damnable Reds. Our security system was barely able to divert the missiles away from the city and garrison. Several dozen of nuclear explosions occured in the vicinity. Hawthorne became a zone of strong irradiation, because of the huge amounts of radioactive dust raised by the explosions. And the level is constantly increasing.}
{114}{}{我是狄更斯下士，我写这篇文章是为了那些在我们之后进入卫戍区的人。今天是2077年10月25日。昨天霍桑市遭到了可恶的红军的大规模核攻击。我们的安全系统几乎无法将导弹从城市和驻军转移出去。附近发生了几十次核爆炸。由于爆炸产生的大量放射性尘埃，霍桑成为强辐射区。而且水平在不断提高。}
#{115}{}{We have launched an automated unit for cleaning the area from radiation, but, apparently, it's too late. The population of the city does not know where to hide from this invisible threat. The only local shelter was destroyed during the bombings. Most of the civilians left to Reno and Las Vegas, those who stayed are dying from radiation in their homes. The city is under curfew. We don't know what happened to the rest of the world. Communications to other military bases and Washington are lost. Perhaps, this is the worst case scenario, and the whole country is in ruins.}
{115}{}{我们已经启动了一个自动装置来清除辐射，但是，显然，为时已晚。这个城市的居民不知道该躲在哪里躲避这种无形的威胁。当地唯一的避难所在爆炸中被毁。大多数平民被送往里诺和拉斯维加斯，留下来的人在家中死于核辐射。该市实行宵禁。我们不知道世界其他地方发生了什么。与其他军事基地和华盛顿的通讯中断。也许，这是最坏的情况，整个国家都成了废墟。}
#{116}{}{Staying in Hawthorne is impossible, I took over command and decided to leave the base together with the remnants of the garrison. We'll take the transport, supplies, provisions and arms, and then, with our families, will go inland. Probably, it's safer this way than to stay here. We will activate the permanent security system to prevent looting. You can disable it from only one place - the V9 hangar. God help us. God help you.}
{116}{}{留在霍桑是不可能的，我接管了指挥权，并决定离开基地与残余的驻军一起。我们将带着运输工具、补给、粮食和武器，然后和家人一起，去内陆。也许，这样比呆在这里安全。我们将启动永久安全系统，防止抢劫。你只能在一个地方禁用它-V9机库。上帝保佑我们。上帝保佑你。}
