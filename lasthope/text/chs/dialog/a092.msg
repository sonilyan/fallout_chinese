### {100}{}{Welcome customer, looks like this is your first time here. Before we proceed, a friendly suggestion, keep your hands where I can see them and don't touch anything you're not supposed to. Now, what can I do for you?}
{100}{}{欢迎客户，看来这是您第一次来这里。在我们继续之前，一个友好的建议是，把手放在我能看到的地方，不要碰任何不该碰的东西。现在，我能为你做什么？}
### {101}{}{What do you sell here?}
{101}{}{你们这里卖什么？}
### {102}{}{Can you tell me something about this place?}
{102}{}{你能告诉我这个地方的一些情况吗？}
### {103}{}{Nothing right now.}
{103}{}{现在什么都没有。}
### {104}{}{We sell lots of stuff you won't find just anywhere. Our sales network spreads wide across the wasteland. We pay well to our suppliers and we expect the same from our customers because it's all about quality! Now, let me show you our stock...}
{104}{}{我们卖很多你在任何地方都找不到的东西。我们的销售网络遍布荒原。我们向供应商支付了很高的费用，我们对客户也抱有同样的期望，因为这一切都与质量有关！现在，让我给你看看我们的存货。。。}
### {105}{}{Alright.}
{105}{}{好吧}
### {106}{}{Not right now, let me ask you something.}
{106}{}{现在不行，让我问你一件事。}
### {107}{}{Yes, what can I help you with?}
{107}{}{是的，有什么能帮你的吗？}
### {108}{}{Show me your stuff.}
{108}{}{给我看看你的东西。}
### {109}{}{Tell me something about this place.}
{109}{}{告诉我这个地方的情况。}
### {110}{}{Actually, I don't need anything right now.}
{110}{}{事实上，我现在什么都不需要。}
### {111}{}{Well, the history of this place is quite interesting. This vault was build to be a shelter during the war. But as we found out while digging through the data stored in the computers below, it had its own dark secret. Besides protecting the people from the outside world, it was also used by the government as some kind of experiment facility...}
{111}{}{这个地方的历史很有趣。这个拱顶是在战争期间建造的。但正如我们在挖掘下面计算机中存储的数据时发现的那样，它有自己的黑暗秘密。除了保护人民免受外界的伤害，它还被政府用作某种实验设施。。。}
### {112}{}{What kind of experiments?}
{112}{}{什么样的实验？}
### {113}{}{When the war reached its height, the government became desperate for any new weapon and started to experiment on people. The people in this vault to be precise. They hoped to develop a biological weapon that could kill within seconds... hundreds died during the tests. Some developed hideous mutations while others... well, the most actually, went through agonizing suffering before their eventual death.}
{113}{}{当战争达到高潮时，政府迫切需要任何新武器，并开始在人民身上进行实验。确切地说是这个金库里的人。他们希望开发出一种能在几秒钟内杀死人的生物武器。。。数百人在测试中死亡。一些人出现了可怕的突变，而另一些人。。。事实上，大多数人在最终去世前都经历了痛苦的折磨。}
### {114}{}{What about those with mutations?}
{114}{}{那些有突变的人呢？}
### {115}{}{Did anyone survive the experiments?}
{115}{}{有人在实验中幸存下来吗？}
### {116}{}{Some escaped the vault and allied themselves against normal humans. Their struggle against us lasted for decades, but I couldn't find anything about the outcome. I guess it's a long forgotten part of history that nobody wants to recall. I actually saw something larger than any man I know, covered with branches as a camouflage, moving in the woods during my last week's patrol... or maybe it was one of those ape man things, you know... from the old books. Anyway, if it gets closer to my flamethrower next time, I'll say Eat fire, Darwin prick! [Smiles.]}
{116}{}{一些人逃离了金库，与普通人结盟。他们与我们的斗争持续了几十年，但我找不到任何结果。我想这是历史上被遗忘已久的一部分，没有人愿意回忆。事实上，在我上周的巡逻中，我看到了一个比我认识的任何人都大的东西，上面覆盖着树枝作为伪装，在树林里移动。。。或者这可能是猿人的一件事，你知道。。。来自旧书。不管怎样，如果下次它离我的火焰喷射器越来越近，我会说，吃火吧，达尔文混蛋！[微笑。]}
### {117}{}{Say, can you point out where you have seen this thing?}
{117}{}{比如，你能指出你在哪里见过这个东西吗？}
### {118}{}{Interesting, can I ask you something?}
{118}{}{很有趣，我能问你点什么吗？}
### {119}{}{Thanks for the story, I must be going now.}
{119}{}{谢谢你的故事，我现在必须走了。}
### {120}{}{Sorry stranger, I can't give you any information about our patrol routes. It's classified.}
{120}{}{对不起，陌生人，我不能给你任何关于我们巡逻路线的信息。它是保密的。}
### {121}{}{That experiments you were talking about, any survivors?}
{121}{}{你说的那些实验，有幸存者吗？}
### {122}{}{I see, let me ask you something.}
{122}{}{我明白了，让我问你一件事。}
### {123}{}{Except those mutants that escaped? No, nothing in the records... probably covered up. Poor bastards...}
{123}{}{除了那些逃跑的变种人？不，记录里什么都没有。。。可能被掩盖了。可怜的混蛋。。。}
### {124}{}{Yep, let me ask you something else.}
{124}{}{是的，让我再问你一件事。}
### {125}{}{Sure, what can I do for you?}

### {134}{}{Haha, I know you can. But I have my orders, so you better keep that money and your mouth shut. Alright?}
{134}{}{哈哈，我知道你可以。但我有我的订单，所以你最好把钱收起来，闭嘴。好吧}
### {135}{}{Uh... OK.}
{135}{}{嗯好啊}
