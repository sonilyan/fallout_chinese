{205}{}{是的，顺便说一下，我希望能从食尸鬼那里买些东西。但他们不想得到它们，或者它们收费太高。如果你在废墟中为我找到它们，我会付钱给你的。}

### {217}{}{Why do you need all these old artifacts?}
{217}{}{你为什么需要这些旧工艺品？}
### {218}{}{My boss Butch at the Hub will be terribly unhappy if I come back empty-handed. And the Hub needs a bunch of different things. And not just him. All of California survives due to ancient technology. And over time, it becomes less.}
{218}{}{如果我两手空空地回来，我在Hub的老板Butch会非常不高兴。Hub需要很多不同的东西。不仅仅是他。由于古老的技术，整个加利福尼亚州得以幸存。随着时间的推移，它变得越来越少。}

### {220}{}{Where can I find a water chip?}

### {222}{}{Where can I find a printed circuit board?}
{222}{}{我在哪里可以找到印刷电路板？}

### {229}{}{Do you know about the military base on Coronado Island? And about the military airfield? So they were torn to shreds by nuclear explosions.

{229}{}{你知道科罗纳多岛上的军事基地吗？军用机场呢？所以他们被核爆炸撕成了碎片。但食尸鬼们说，那里还有一家为军事设备提供服务的工厂。这就是图纸本可以保存的地方。顺便说一下? 我不知道什么是“旋翼飞机”。}

### {245}{}{Phoenix also uses caps for exchange.}
{245}{}{菲尼克斯也使用帽子进行交换。}
### {246}{}{Are there Hubbucks in Phoenix? Hmm! The Hub has been supporting the cap currency for many years. Probably, someone moved this idea to the east. Just what kind of people could cross the Toxic Divide between Arizona and California? This is interesting!}
{246}{}{菲尼克斯有Hubbucks吗？嗯！该中心多年来一直支持上限货币。也许，有人把这个想法搬到了东方。什么样的人可以跨越亚利桑那州和加利福尼亚州之间的有毒鸿沟？这很有趣！}
### {247}{}{Let's go back...}

### {252}{}{Must be hard work?}
{252}{}{一定很辛苦吧？}

{253}{}{非常有一段时间，我们遭受了超级变种人和各种垃圾的袭击。许多人和婆罗门迷失了方向，直到有一个人阻止了它。寻求庇护者――每个人都这么称呼他。}
### {254}{}{Where did the super mutants come from here?}
{254}{}{超级变种人是从哪里来的？}

{256}{}{继续}
### {257}{}{I know the story. You don't have to go on.}
{257}{}{我知道这个故事。你不必继续。}

### {262}{}{Which office were you talking about?}
{262}{}{你说的是哪个办公室？}
### {263}{}{Some settlements were unlucky enough to get in their way. Therefore, people have been fighting mutants in recent years. No wonder some of the green fuckers ended up here ? away from human settlements.}
{263}{}{一些定居点运气不好，挡住了他们的去路。因此，近年来人们一直在与变种人作斗争。怪不得有些绿色的混蛋最终来到了这里? 远离人类住区。}
