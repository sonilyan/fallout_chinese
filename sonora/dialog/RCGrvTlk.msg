#Dialog
### {200}{}{(You see an old man standing thoughtfully in front of the grave)}
{200}{}{（你看到一位老人若有所思地站在墓前）}
### {201}{}{[Next]}
{201}{}{[下一个]}

### {210}{}{What do you want from me?}
{210}{}{你想从我这里得到什么？}
### {211}{}{Nevermind.}
{211}{}{永远不会。}
### {212}{}{I see.}
{212}{}{我明白了。}
### {213}{}{.}
{213}{}{。}

### {220}{}{Who are you, old man?}
{220}{}{你是谁，老人？}
### {221}{}{The old man? Heh, I'm barely forty years old, and I already look like a petrified antiquity, right? I'm a farmer. Growing crops two miles from here.}
{221}{}{那个老人？呵呵，我才四十多岁，就已经是一个石化的古人了，对不对？我是个农民。在离这里两英里的地方种植庄稼。}
### {222}{}{So you're not a Ranger?}
{222}{}{所以你不是游骑兵？}
### {223}{}{Don't talk nonsense. What kind of ranger am I at my age and with these dirty hands? My job is to keep an eye on the farm, not to chase bandits.}
{223}{}{别胡说八道。在我这个年纪，有这么脏的手，我是什么样的护林员？我的工作是监视农场，而不是追捕土匪。}
### {224}{}{I came across one farm on the way.}
{224}{}{我在路上遇到一个农场。}
### {225}{}{There are several farms and ranches in the area. The Rangers cover our brother, but they take their own percentages of the harvest for it... Sometimes leaving us pitiful crumbs for living... But things get better over time. The Earth is recovering from a lot of Pollution from year to year.}
{225}{}{这个地区有几个农场和牧场。游骑兵队掩护我们的兄弟，但他们拿走了他们自己的收成百分比…有时给我们留下可怜的面包屑。。。但随着时间的推移，情况会好转。地球每年都在从大量污染中恢复。}
### {226}{}{Pollution?}
{226}{}{污染}
### {227}{}{The general once told me over a cup of herbal tea. When the nuclear bombs fell a hundred years ago, these lands were covered with clouds of radioactive ash. The clouds came from the west, east and south, depending on where the wind was blowing from. It was bad everywhere in those years. They say the land here has been barren for generations. Only cacti managed to maintain their life cycle thanks to deep roots. And only now the earth has begun to recover.}
{227}{}{将军曾经边喝凉茶边告诉我。当100年前核弹落下时，这些土地上覆盖着放射性火山灰云。云层来自西部、东部和南部，这取决于风从哪里吹来。那些年到处都很糟糕。他们说这里的土地几代人以来都是贫瘠的。只有仙人掌由于根系深厚而得以维持其生命周期。直到现在，地球才开始复苏。}

### {230}{}{What are you doing here?}
{230}{}{你在这里干什么？}
### {231}{}{What can a saddened old man do in a cemetery? Obviously, I've come to remember the old days. Here is my son's grave. The inscription on the cross is almost erased, but I still have the sense not to forget his name and the location of the grave.}
{231}{}{一个悲伤的老人在墓地里能做什么？很明显，我开始怀念过去的日子了。这是我儿子的坟墓。十字架上的铭文几乎被抹去了，但我仍然有一种感觉，不要忘记他的名字和坟墓的位置。}
### {232}{}{Tell me how he died.}
{232}{}{告诉我他是怎么死的。}
### {233}{}{Young people are impatient. Working on plantations is exhausting for them. But the earth gives its fruits only to those who have worked hard for many years. So is my Jacob. He went to the rangers, so as not to mess around in the beds. The first encounter with the raiders during the patrol took his life.}
{233}{}{年轻人不耐烦。在种植园工作对他们来说很累人。但是，地球只把它的果实送给那些辛勤工作多年的人。我的雅各布也是。他去找护林员，以免在床上乱来。巡逻时第一次遇到袭击者就夺去了他的生命。}
### {234}{}{Do you hate Rangers now?}
{234}{}{你现在讨厌游骑兵队吗？}
### {235}{}{I drive away such thoughts. Rangers are doing a noble thing - restoring order in the wastelands. Yes, at the same time someone dies. You can't please everyone. If you help one, you will offend the other. This is the true face of justice.}
{235}{}{我把这种想法赶走了。游骑兵正在做一件高尚的事情――在荒原上恢复秩序。是的，同时有人死了。你不可能取悦所有人。如果你帮助一个人，你就会冒犯另一个人。这才是正义的真谛。}

### {240}{}{Whose graves are these?}
{240}{}{这些是谁的坟墓？}
### {241}{}{Rangers bury their brothers according to the old tradition - they bury them in the ground. A cartridge is placed in the grave, usually a revolver caliber. If there is no revolver, any other one will do. And if there is no such thing, then they put a cartridge case or a fired bullet. By this they mean to say that even after death one should not lose the strength of the spirit.}
{241}{}{游骑兵按照古老的传统埋葬他们的兄弟――他们把他们埋在地里。坟墓里放着一个子弹，通常是左轮手枪口径。如果没有左轮手枪，其他人都可以。如果没有，他们就会放一个弹壳或一发子弹。他们的意思是说，即使死了，也不应该失去精神的力量。}
