{100}{}{Good day stranger, what can I do for you.}
{101}{}{What is this place?}
{102}{}{Who are you?}
{103}{}{Got any job for me?}
{104}{}{Nothing.}
#this place
{105}{}{This is a public library... or what's left of it. You can find some old books here if you like to read. Most of
 these are in electronic format, all kept in this computer. [Sighs.] Took me years to type them down, letter by letter.
 We just had too many books... This was the best way to preserve data and reduce data search time. We also hold
 public discussions from time to time.}
{106}{}{Got any books that are not in the computer. You know, "real" books?}
{107}{}{Any interesting discussions lately?}
{108}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
#got any books?
{109}{}{I can't say for sure, you have to check on the shelves. But don't be disappointed, some of them were in very
 bad shape. While the good ones were scanned into our electronic database and sold in exchange for equipment. You
 can use the computer to find what you need. [Pushes a button on her console.] It should work now. Take your time.}
{110}{}{Thanks.}
# any interesting discussion lately?
{111}{}{Well, yes. Most recently we have been talking about the security problems in our town. Especially the more
 frequent bandit attacks have become a number one priority in our discussions. Ever since their base got compromised,
 the Dogs are spread all over the waste, leaving a trail of dead in their wake. We're currently planning to push them
 away from the surrounding areas, and gathered as many people as we could, but there are still plenty of seats left...}
{112}{}{Can I join the group?}
{113}{}{Let me ask you something else then.}
#who are you?
{114}{}{I'm Jasmine and I run this library. This might be of interest to you, most of the books we had were transcribed
 into the computer but we still get new ones from time to time. First, we check them for integrity, then cleaning,
 sorting pages if needed... Personally, I like every part of this job. I kept some of my favorite books in their
 original format. Nothing makes me feel better than holding and reading a real book. Don't you agree?}
{115}{}{Yeah, you're right.}
{116}{}{I can make better use of them once downloaded to my pip-boy.}
#You're right...
{117}{}{Say, if you like to read books then I must ask you for a favor.}
{118}{}{OK, say it...}
#ok say it
{119}{}{I'm looking for an old edition called "The Lavender Flower". I'm worried because I had that book in my
 library and now it's gone, I can't find it anywhere. It's really weird, I always keep rare ones in my locker. Maybe... you
 see, we never lock the doors because there's always somebody inside. I doubt it and I don’t like accusing others without
 proof... but there's a local drunkard wandering about town... people call him "Crazy Booze". He's drunk most of the
 time but don't let that fool you, he's all trouble even when he is sober. Maybe he tried to steal something from my
 locker, saw that book and thought he could sell it. Can you pay him a visit, see if he has my book?}
{120}{}{Sure thing Jasmine. I hope he's not lying unconscious somewhere... }
#i have better use with my pipboy...
{121}{}{Hm, another hi-tech nerd... good for you. Too bad you don't appreciate real sentimental values. I don't want to
 waste your time then.}
{122}{}{Let me ask you something else then.}
#got any jobs...
{123}{}{Sorry, nothing new lately. You might try with the sheriff, last time I heard, he's busy all day long. Then,
 there's Mr. Aston...}
{124}{}{Thanks.}
#
#
{125}{}{Hey, I found this book...}
#
{126}{}{[Surprised.] Is that what I think it is...? Please let me have a look at it.}
{127}{}{Sure, it's all yours.}
{128}{}{No way, this one is mine.}
# sure...
{129}{}{Thank you very much. You know, some books arrived yesterday. I already scanned them into the computer
 and felt sorry to throw them away, but you'll find them useful I'm sure [smiles]. Please take them as a token of my appreciation.}
{130}{}{You're welcome.}
#can I join the group?
{131}{}{[Smiles.] There isn't any official procedure, we just gather here once a week and talk about... well, everything.
 [She smiles.] So you're free to participate, I'll let you know when there's a scheduled meeting.}
{132}{}{Thanks for the info.}
#
{133}{}{You can use that computer any time you need, you'll find new books if you're interested in reading.}
#
{134}{}{Come back when it's bright enough to read.}
{135}{}{We don't work at night.}
#

{137}{}{Let me ask you something else then.}
#
{138}{}{Anything else I can help you with?}
#jobs...
{139}{}{Where can I find the sheriff?}
{140}{}{Who's this Mr. Aston?}
#
{141}{}{His office is to the north, you can't miss the sign.}
#
{142}{}{Yeah, Mr. Aston... He owns that fancy power generator. He used to travel when he was about your age, now
 he has enough money to hire some young cowboy for the job... [smiles]. You can find his place north-east of here. Be
 careful though, if his men don't let you in, don't mess with them. Last guy who tried that took a good beating. Now
 he's nowhere to be found, probably left town in a hurry.}
#
{143}{}{Hey I'm glad you could make it. And feel free to contribute. [Smiles.]}
{144}{}{Thanks, but I prefer to listen.}
#
{145}{}{If the sheriff was here, he would know what to do.}
{146}{}{People don't read much these days.}
{147}{}{We need some major repairs in this place.}
{148}{}{Our town could use more protection.}
{149}{}{...haven't seen any caravans for a long time.}
{150}{}{We have a water pollution problem, why won't anyone do something!}
{151}{}{Come on people, we need solutions, not more problems.}
{152}{}{Anybody?}
{153}{}{It's so quiet today, what's going on?}
{154}{}{Our monument is falling apart, it needs repairs.}
#bob in jail
{155}{}{You know, Bob earned himself some jail time so I better ask the sheriff about this.}
#115
{156}{}{I got something you can hold... I'm sure you'll like it.}
{157}{}{Oh, how dare you! This is so, ugh... Get out now!}
{158}{}{What, no fun anymore?}
{159}{}{Don't blame me, I'm just a guy, I have needs...}
{160}{}{What did ya say, bitch!?}
{161}{}{Oh, I'm sorry... it slipped out of my mouth, I'll just leave...}
#
{162}{}{I don't know you anymore!}
{163}{}{Get out of my sight.}
{164}{}{I don't want to be be anywhere near you.}
{165}{}{I'm ignoring you.}
#bob dead
{166}{}{Well, Bob had a bit of an accident, I better ask the sheriff about this.}
#
{167}{}{You found Jasmine's book. You earn 200 exp. points.}
