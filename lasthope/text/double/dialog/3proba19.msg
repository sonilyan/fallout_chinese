{100}{}{Hey, haven't seen you before. New face, right?}
{101}{}{Yep, what can you tell me about this place.}
{102}{}{Yeah, who are you?}
{103}{}{Later.}
# about this place...
{104}{}{Walls, walls, that's all I can tell you. Memories of the outside world faded away over time. There's just this
 place, [he looks around] - that’s all I can remember. I've been living here for years... lost my sense of time. All I do
 is watch day and night go by and that goes on and on. [Sighs.] At least they take good care of prisoners, can't
 complain about it.}
{105}{}{Ever tried to escape?}
{106}{}{What do you think about this place?}
{107}{}{That's a nice story, let me ask you something else.}
# escape...
{108}{}{Wait, why would I do such a thing? I got everything here, even a sense that I belong somewhere. This is the
 closest to living that I remember from a long time ago. Life in the wasteland only taught me how to survive by taking
 from others. Here we got a "thing" going. Me and my buddies provide protection, for a small fee of course. You
 never know when a drunk guard is gonna beat the hell out of you or some crazy addict tries to rob you in your sleep,
 just think about it.}
{109}{}{Right... Anybody ever tried to escape?}
{110}{}{Lucky you. Tell me something about...}
#did...
{111}{}{Well, I was in my cell the night it happened. But from what I've heard, a couple of my buddies tried to. Now,
 I say buddies because we all, like, live in the same prison. Anyway, that was a real disaster... One of them went first,
 got over the fence. Four others managed to disappear into the night after him. But at that point some nutcase had
 triggered the alarm. None of the other inmates had a chance to run for it. Such a shame, that was a one-time
 opportunity...}
{112}{}{Maybe... so, those who got away, what do you know about them?}
#
{113}{}{[Makes an angry face.] Hey, you want me to betray my buddies... [quickly looks around him]. Hm, no one is
 watching, [speaks louder] I couldn't help you... Even if you had, say $250 cash... [whispers] my safety has a price, too.}
{114}{}{Well I do have $250. [You clear your throat.] "But I'm not giving it to you!" [You look around then try to slip
 him the money.]}
{115}{}{No, I don't.}
#no i don't...
{116}{}{What the...? [Spits on the floor.] You got some balls, coming here and giving me that crap! No money, no
 honey. Got it!?}
{117}{}{I'll get the money.}
# $250...
{118}{}{[Counts the money without looking at it.] Alright, here's what I know... By the way, your acting sucks... thank
 me later. There were five guys... Maan, Jeff, Dingo and Decks. And of course, the other guy who ran off first... This
 guy Maan was a killer, paid hitman if you will. How many lives he took, only god knows. Regarding Jeff, I don't really
 know that much, he was out of my circle... I heard he was a terrorist or somethin'...}
{119}{}{OK, go on...}
#
{120}{}{Then there was this troublemaker, Dingo. A thief, he used to beat up people for money and stuff, not very
 clear what's going on in his head. Decks was a new guy but he quickly got himself a nickname, "street fighter". He
 started a few scraps not long ago... tough son of a bitch, I can tell you that. Everyone was on the lookout because you
 never knew who this bastard was going to come down on next. Prior to this, he was doing a long jail time, for beating
 up the wrong guy. [He smiles.] And there you go...}
#
{121}{}{After all that tongue flapping, they sure noticed already. But I'll keep my mouth shut.}
{122}{}{Thanks anyway... but I don't buy this crap!}
#what do you think about this place...
{123}{}{The place is just fine, I'm not complaining.}
{124}{}{That was a short one. Let me ask you something else.}
# after 107, 110, 124 and 128
{125}{}{Just say it man...}
#
{126}{}{Hey there, want something?}
#who are you
{127}{}{I'm Gary... So what brings you here?}
{128}{}{I can't remember. I had a memory loss... Let me ask you something.}
#
{129}{}{Hey, I got the money you wanted. [Try to slip him the money casually.]}
#
{130}{}{Did you participate in the incident?}
#after 120 added...1.2006
{131}{}{Hell no! What gave you that crazy idea!? If I was involved, why would I tell you all this? No hard feelings,
 but you really start to piss me off. And if you think about spreading anymore shit, know that me and my buddies will
 be waiting for your sorry ass right here.}
{132}{}{That's fine, you wait. Don't go anywhere.}
#
{133}{}{Well, ain't that my old friend? [Chuckles.] Well, you didn't want to listen so I'm going to show you how we
 make people listen around here!}
{134}{}{[Exit.]}
#
{135}{}{I was chased by giant ants, scorpions... You call that "good care"!?}
#chased...
{136}{}{Why yes... We had a deal. I paid some money and they let me stay here, with shelter and protection. I have
 many enemies outside who want my head, so I'm much better off here. And I don't give a damn about you or your
 problems, get lost scum!}
{137}{}{[Leave.]}
#31.5.2014...after
{138}{}{That's four by my count, what happened to the fifth guy, the one who ran off first?}
#
{139}{}{Are you sure I haven't mentioned him before, strange... Anyway, he goes by the name of Scott. Some would
 argue that he was the master mind behind it but I find that hard to believe. He never drew attention to himself, never
 caused any trouble. He always had that dull look on his face which I never found interesting... [He ends abruptly.]
 Now, move along, people will notice if you keep hanging around. And in case anything happens... We know who did
 us dirty. [He smiles at you.]}
{140}{}{How about I tell the administrator everything... Or, better yet, I keep quiet but you shoot yourself and make it
 look like an accident!?}
#
{141}{}{We have nothing to talk about.}
{142}{}{Keep moving.}
{143}{}{Don't even look at me.}
