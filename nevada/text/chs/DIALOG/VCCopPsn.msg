#{102}{}{The police officer here does not allow you to speak with the prisoner.}

#{110}{}{Who sent you?}
{110}{}{谁派你来的？}
#{111}{}{I'm here not on someone's tip. I was just wondering how a young man with such a stylish hairstyle could end up behind the bars.}
{111}{}{我来这里不是靠别人的小费。我只是在想，一个留着这么时髦发型的年轻人怎么会被关进监狱。}
#{112}{}{I was framed! They don't care about whether I stole the money or not, they just need somebody to put the blame on. Fucking pigs...}
{112}{}{我被陷害了！他们不在乎我是否偷了钱，他们只需要有人来责怪。该死的猪...}
#{113}{}{Saying you are not guilty? Can you prove it?}
{113}{}{说你无罪？你能证明吗？}
#{114}{}{I won the money in casino, fair and square. There should have records about this, but don't think they'll share this information. So, it turns out that I can't prove anything... [lowers his voice] Hey, listen, you're not a cop, right? Can you help me out? My guys will repay you for this.}
{114}{}{我在赌场赢了钱，很公平。应该有这方面的记录，但不要认为他们会分享这些信息。所以，结果证明不了什么...嘿，听着，你不是警察，对吧？你能帮我吗？我的人会报答你的。}
#{115}{}{Hmm, let me think...}
{115}{}{嗯，让我想想...}
#{116}{}{No time to think, think plenty afterwards... Listen, you need to find my buddy, his name is Orris. Usually he can be found near the "Hard Rock" cafe. Tell him that his old friend Murphy is in trouble, he will understand... He will help... [grabs his head in despair] he... Will help...}
{116}{}{没有时间思考，以后要想很多...听着，你得找到我的朋友，他叫奥里斯。通常在“硬石”咖啡馆附近可以找到他。告诉他他的老朋友墨菲有麻烦了，他会明白的...他会帮助...[绝望地抓着头]他...会有帮助...}
#{117}{}{Maybe I'll find and talk to this Orris. But I need to know the details of this story.}
{117}{}{也许我会找到这个奥里斯并和他谈谈。但我需要知道这个故事的细节。}
#{118}{}{[Leave him]}

#{119}{}{I was framed!}

#{121}{}{Remind me, where to find your friend Orris.}

#{122}{}{Usually he can be found near the "Hard Rock" cafe. Tell him that his old friend Murphy is in trouble.}
{122}{}{通常在“硬石”咖啡馆附近可以找到他。告诉他他的老朋友墨菲有麻烦了。}
#{123}{}{It was like that: I won some in the casino. Not a lot, but you still can have a really good party with that money. When I went outside, the cops kettled me off without any explanation. Then brought me here, then this smart-ass from the mayor's office appeared and outlined how much money I have in my pockets, and in which bills. He knew it for sure, I remember him near the cash register in the casino. He followed me! Now it turns out like I stole these money from him.}
{123}{}{就像这样：我在赌场赢了一些。不是很多，但你还是可以用这些钱开一个很好的派对。我出去时，警察毫无解释地把我赶走了。然后把我带到这里来，市长办公室的一个聪明的家伙出现了，他勾勒出我口袋里有多少钱，还有哪些账单。他肯定知道，我记得他在赌场的收银机旁。他跟着我！现在看来好像是我偷了他的钱。}
#{124}{}{Who is this "smart-ass from the mayor's office"?}
{124}{}{这个“市长办公室的蠢货”是谁？}
#{125}{}{But can't they identify you in the casino?}
{125}{}{但他们不能在赌场认出你吗？}
#{126}{}{Why should I believe you?}
{126}{}{我为什么要相信你？}
#{127}{}{I see. I have to go.}
{127}{}{我懂了。我得走了。}
#{128}{}{Some Irwin guy, an employee of the City Hall. Looks like many people here know him, but I don't. I'm from the suburbs, I don't hang out with the locals.}
{128}{}{一个叫欧文的家伙，市政厅的雇员。看起来这里很多人都认识他，但我不认识。我来自郊区，不跟当地人交往。}
#{129}{}{Surely they can. They write everything down in this ledger book, but the cops don't care, they tend to believe that guy from the mayor's office. And I am sure that casino won't stand up for me. It's more important for them to lick the ass of the City Hall and the cops.}
{129}{}{他们当然可以。他们把一切都写在账本上，但警察不在乎，他们倾向于相信市长办公室的那个家伙。我相信赌场不会支持我的。对他们来说更重要的是舔市政厅和警察的屁股。}
#{130}{}{You? You shouldn't. Why would you care... But I'm not asking you to believe me! I'm asking to talk to Orris, he will help, he's an old friend. And you might have something from it, you understand?}
{130}{}{你呢？你不应该。为什么你会在乎...但我不是要你相信我！我想和奥里斯谈谈，他会帮忙的，他是个老朋友。你可能会从中得到一些东西，明白吗？}
#{131}{}{What's going on?!}
{131}{}{发生什么事？！}
#{132}{}{Well, apparently, the police officer in the waiting room is no longer at his duty. You should be happy.}
{132}{}{很显然，候车室的警察已经不在值班了。你应该高兴。}
#{133}{}{Of course! Uh, listen, I don't know what happened there, but thanks for the help. Now I'll quickly sneak out the door, and then out, through the bushes. See ya!}
{133}{}{当然！呃，听着，我不知道那里发生了什么，但是谢谢你的帮助。现在我要迅速溜出门，然后出去，穿过灌木丛。再见！}
#{134}{}{Bye.}
{134}{}{再见。}
#{135}{}{Nothing special. Sit down and shut up.}
{135}{}{没什么特别的。坐下，闭嘴。}
#{136}{}{Apparently, you didn't lie. I managed to peep into the accounting entries in the casino ledger. It all fits - you've been framed.}
{136}{}{显然，你没有撒谎。我设法偷看了赌场账本上的会计分录。一切都符合-你被陷害了。}
#{137}{}{I told you! The people of the Clean City are awfully high of themselves. Listen, will you be able to bring the evidence to the cops? Orris will surely reward you for this.}
{137}{}{我告诉过你！清洁城市的人们自高自大。听着，你能把证据带给警察吗？奥里斯一定会为此奖励你的。}
#{138}{}{I'll think about it.}
{138}{}{我会考虑的。}
#{139}{}{What that cop has told you? You were talking about me, right?}
{139}{}{那个警察跟你说了什么？你在说我，对吧？}
#{140}{}{He said that you're free.}
{140}{}{他说你自由了。}
#{141}{}{Nothing that concerns you.}

#{142}{}{Really?! I don't know how you did it, but thanks for the help. I need to quickly get out of here, before they'll change their mind. See ya!}
{142}{}{真正地？！我不知道你是怎么做到的，但是谢谢你的帮助。在他们改变主意之前，我得赶紧离开这里。再见！}
