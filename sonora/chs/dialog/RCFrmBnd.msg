{213}{}{你受了这样的伤似乎活不了多久了。我会打电话给游骑兵队寻求帮助...}
### {214}{}{no! These bastards won't want to help me. It's because of them that I got into such a mess! Like you, I was just traveling in search of a new place to live. The Rangers mistook me for a bandit and, not wanting to figure it out, just shot me. I was lucky to survive, and pulled out the bullet with a knife, but this wound will finish me!}
{214}{}{不这些混蛋不会想帮我的。正是因为他们，我才陷入如此混乱！和你一样，我只是在旅行，寻找一个新的住处。游骑兵误以为我是土匪，不想弄清楚，就开枪打了我。我很幸运地活了下来，用刀拔出了子弹，但这个伤口会把我干掉的！}
