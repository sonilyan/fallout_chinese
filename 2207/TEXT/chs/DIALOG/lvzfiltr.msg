### {8}{}{Everything is so wrong here... This filter will never filter anything ever again.}
{8}{}{这里的一切都错了。。。此筛选器再也不会筛选任何内容。}
### {9}{}{[Before you stand a quite complex mechanism of the filtration unit. Different wires stick up here and there, a cloudy liquid drips from hoses. It seems that someone, who didn't really know what he was doing, has already put some efforts here...]}
{9}{}{[在你面前是一个相当复杂的过滤装置。不同的电线到处都是，一种浑浊的液体从软管中滴下来。似乎有人不知道自己在做什么，已经在这里付出了一些努力。。。]}
### {10}{}{Screw it... [exit]}
{10}{}{去他妈的…[退出]}
### {11}{}{Phew, it's too hard... [exit]}

#fix 003
### {21}{}{[Your movements turn out to be so clumsy and catastrophically wrong that all the mechanisms inside the apparatus gnash, something slams, gurgles, and then everything collapses. Looks like this is the end of the line for this filter.]}
