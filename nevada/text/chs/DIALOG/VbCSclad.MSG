#{100}{}{You see: Sam.}
{100}{}{你看：山姆。}
#{101}{}{You see Sam, a young man responsible for warehouse operations.}
{101}{}{你看山姆，一个负责仓库运作的年轻人。}
#{102}{}{If I see you trying one more time... }
{102}{}{如果我看到你再试一次。。。}
#{110}{}{Hi, citizen }
{110}{}{嗨，市民}
#{112}{}{. How can I help you?}
{112}{}{. 我能帮你什么？}
#{113}{}{You? After that business with Joshua, I thought they would isolate you. Strange to still see you here.}
{113}{}{你呢？在和约书亚做了那件事之后，我以为他们会孤立你。在这里还见到你真奇怪。}
#{114}{}{I wanted to say goodbye before I leave. So... Goodbye.}
{114}{}{我想在离开前说再见。所以。。。再见。}
#{115}{}{Anything else?}
{115}{}{还有别的吗？}
#{118}{}{I don't recognize any of this stuff.}
{118}{}{我一点也不认识这些东西。}
#{119}{}{That's none of my business, I just take inventory. I heard you lost your memory, so I'm not surprised you don't remember any of it. Probably, those things belonged to the outsider that brought you here. They're definitely not from Vault City.}
{119}{}{那不关我的事，我只是清点一下。我听说你失忆了，所以你一点都不记得我一点也不奇怪。也许，这些东西是外人带你来这里的。他们肯定不是从金库城来的。}
#{120}{}{I came to get my things.}
{120}{}{我来拿我的东西。}
#{121}{}{I was told to assemble everything you had on you when you came in. They're in the locker on the left. They include... [checks his list] ...One pistol, one switchblade, one water flask, one paper note, and 128 dollars. Please check if everything is in order and sign... Here.}
{121}{}{你进来的时候，我被告知要把你身上所有的东西都整理好。它们在左边的储物柜里。它们包括。。。[核对清单]…一把手枪，一把刀，一个水瓶，一张纸条，还有128美元。请检查是否一切正常并签字。。。在这里。}
#{122}{}{What if I need anything else?}
{122}{}{如果我还需要什么呢？}
#{123}{}{Good. Thank you.}
{123}{}{很好。非常感谢。}
#{124}{}{I wasn't told to supply you with anything else.}
{124}{}{我没被要求给你提供其他东西。}
#{125}{}{You mean I can't request anything from the warehouse!?}
{125}{}{你是说我不能向仓库要任何东西！？}
#{126}{}{I can't do anything for you, unless I receive an order from my superiors. But you could complete an assignment for the warehouse.}
{126}{}{我不能为你做任何事，除非我接到上级的命令。但你可以完成仓库的任务。}
#{127}{}{And how can I put in an order?}
{127}{}{我怎样才能下订单呢？}
#{128}{}{Assignment for the warehouse? What do you mean?}
{128}{}{仓库的任务？什么意思？}
#{129}{}{Fine, forget it.}
{129}{}{好吧，算了吧。}
#{130}{}{Can you give me something out of the warehouse?}
{130}{}{你能把仓库里的东西给我吗？}
#{131}{}{If it's important, ask someone with authority to put in a request to the warehouse. They'll fill out the form for you.}
{131}{}{如果很重要，请有权的人向仓库提出申请。他们会帮你填表格的。}
#{132}{}{You said something about an assignment for the warehouse?}
{132}{}{你说了仓库的任务？}
#{133}{}{You said something about requesting an order from your superiors?}
{133}{}{你说要上级下令？}
#{134}{}{We've got some requests for equipment we don't have in stock. There's special procedures in place for trading items with outsiders, if they can give us something valuable.}
{134}{}{我们有人要买一些没有存货的设备。如果外人能给我们一些有价值的东西，我们有专门的程序与他们进行交易。}
#{135}{}{What will I get if I bring you those items?}
{135}{}{如果我把那些东西带给你，我会得到什么？}
#{136}{}{You'll be able to request high-value items from the warehouse, like sniper rifles and armor. But it's a long list, and you'll need to get everything on it.}
{136}{}{你可以向仓库索要贵重物品，比如狙击步枪和防具。但这是一个很长的清单，你需要把所有的东西都记下来。}
#{137}{}{Great. Can I have that list?}
{137}{}{伟大的。能给我那张单子吗？}
#{138}{}{Sure. I'll put it into your Pip-Boy.}
{138}{}{当然。我会把它放进你的皮普小子。}
#{139}{}{[Next]}
{139}{}{[下一步]}
#{140}{}{Done. All of those items are Vault-Tec, so you should know where to look.}
{140}{}{完成。所有这些物品都是保险库技术，所以你应该知道去哪里找。}
#{141}{}{I'll keep that in mind.}
{141}{}{我会记住的。}
#{150}{}{I want to talk to you about that special assignment.}
{150}{}{我想和你谈谈那个特殊任务。}
#{151}{}{You've got the list in your Pip-Boy. Did you manage to find anything?}
{151}{}{你已经把名单放在你的皮普小子里了。你找到什么了吗？}
#{152}{}{No, not yet.}
{152}{}{不，还没有。}
#{153}{}{Yes. }
{153}{}{对。}

{160}{}{嗯。看起来很实用。谢谢，市民。你还有别的东西吗？}
#{161}{}{That's everything on the list. All that's left is the reward.}
{161}{}{名单上就这些了。剩下的就是奖励了。}
#{162}{}{I'll come back when I find the rest of the items.}
{162}{}{我找到剩下的东西就回来。}
#{163}{}{Really? Oh, you're serious! To be honest, this has never happened before. Well, the Overseer's orders were clear, you now have high-level access to the warehouse.}
{163}{}{真正地？哦，你说真的！老实说，这以前从未发生过。好吧，监工的命令很明确，你现在有权进入仓库。}
#{164}{}{Let's see what you've got.}
{164}{}{让我们看看你有什么。}
#{165}{}{I want to receive my reward.}
{165}{}{我想得到我的奖赏。}
#{166}{}{Yes, I remember. Let's get this over with.}
{166}{}{是的，我记得。让我们结束这一切吧。}
#{167}{}{Before I decide, I want to ask you about something else.}
{167}{}{在我决定之前，我想问你一些别的事情。}
#{168}{}{You know, I can't decide yet. Let's do this later, okay?}
{168}{}{你知道，我还不能决定。我们晚点再做，好吗？}
#{169}{}{I can't decide yet. We'll do this later.}
{169}{}{我还不能决定。我们稍后再做。}

#{200}{}{Well, well, well, what do we have here? Where'd you get this magazine, Sam? These women have lost all of their clothes!}
{200}{}{好吧，好吧，好吧，我们这里有什么？你从哪儿弄来的这本杂志，山姆？这些女人把衣服都丢了！}

{201}{}{什么-怎么-别告诉任何人！拜托！它甚至不是我的。。。}
#{202}{}{Yeah, yeah, likely story.}
{202}{}{是的，是的，可能是故事。}
#{203}{}{If not yours, then whose?}
{203}{}{如果不是你的，那是谁的？}
#{204}{}{It's true! It's not mine. It belonged to that prisoner in the cells. They sent it here for storage, and... I was just looking, that's all. That's not against the rules, right?}
{204}{}{是真的！不是我的。它属于牢房里的那个囚犯。他们把它送到这里存放，然后。。。我只是看看而已。这不违反规定，对吧？}
#{205}{}{Maybe not. But you know about the physical contact restrictions. Of course, this is just visual contact, but you might still get in trouble for it.}
{205}{}{也许不是。但你知道身体接触的限制。当然，这只是视觉上的接触，但你可能还是会遇到麻烦。}
#{206}{}{[Hangs his head] I know... It's just so, so *new* to me. They never showed this to us, how other people look... You know, under their clothes. Maybe the doctors know. Even looking at these pictures, it's so... Weird and confusing... }
{206}{}{我知道。。。这对我来说太新鲜了。他们从未向我们展示过，其他人的样子。。。你知道，在他们的衣服下面。也许医生知道。即使是看这些照片，它是如此。。。奇怪又混乱。。。}

{209}{}{我不在乎你是否好奇人们衣服下的样子，山姆。这是你的问题，你得自己解决。}
#{210}{}{Yes... Indeed. There's no rules against reading magazines, only physical contact. The committee can give me a hard time, but they can't punish me too badly. Let's just keep this between you and me, okay?}
{210}{}{对。。。的确。没有禁止看杂志的规定，只有身体接触。委员会可以给我一个艰难的时刻，但他们不能惩罚我太重。让我们保守秘密，好吗？}
#{211}{}{You can trust me, but I'll take the magazine. I might need it in my travels.}

#{213}{}{You think? Oh crap, I'm in big trouble... Look, just take it! Take it out of the city and... And just get it out of here! I'll delete it from the records, so no one will ever know!}
{213}{}{你觉得呢？糟了，我有大麻烦了。。。听着，拿着它！把它带出城市。。。把它弄出去！我会把它从记录中删除，这样就没人知道了！}
#{214}{}{You're making the right choice, Sam. Maybe I'll find use for it out there in the wastes.}
{214}{}{你的选择是对的，山姆。也许我会在荒野中找到它的用处。}
#{215}{}{I don't need your permission, you abhorrent pervert. Just pray I keep this a secret.}
{215}{}{我不需要你的允许，你这个可恶的变态。祈祷我能保守秘密。}
#{216}{}{But it's forbidden... I mean, it's not forbidden to look, but... }
{216}{}{但这是禁止的。。。我是说，不禁止看，但是。。。}
#{217}{}{Come on, Sam, don't be shy. We'll lock the door and be all by ourselves... }
{217}{}{拜托，山姆，别害羞。我们会锁上门独自一人。。。}
#{218}{}{You uncovered Sam's voyeuristic fantasies. Strange as it sounds, Vault City residents do not have any sexual experiences.}
{218}{}{你揭露了山姆的偷窥癖。听起来很奇怪，金库市的居民没有任何性经历。}
#{234}{}{[Mouth hangs open in shock] I... I, er... Uh... }
{234}{}{[震惊地张嘴]我。。。一、 呃。。。休斯敦大学。。。}
#{235}{}{Don't just stand there, Sam. Be honest, you *want* to look, don't you?}
{235}{}{别站在那儿，山姆。老实说，你想看看，是吗？}
#{236}{}{Oh, you look so cute when you're flustered, Sam. You don't just want to look, do you? What if I sit in your lap so you can *touch* it?}
{236}{}{哦，你慌乱的时候看起来很可爱，山姆。你不只是想看，是吗？如果我坐在你腿上让你摸它呢？}
#{237}{}{Well then stay there standing, while I get out of here.}
{237}{}{那就站着别动，等我离开这里。}

#{241}{}{[Tries to push you away] No, stop! What are you doing? We, we can't... The rules... The Overseer... [breathes heavily] ...l-leave me alone, don't touch me. We can't... Physical contact is forbidden, remember?}
{241}{}{[试图推开你]不，停下！你在做什么？我们，我们不能。。。规则。。。监工。。。[气喘吁吁]…别管我，别碰我。我们不能。。。身体接触是禁止的，记得吗？}

{245}{}{这不是你所期望的，是吗，山姆？[紧紧拥抱他]你感觉到了吗？它很软，不是吗？。。。}
#{246}{}{Okay, that's enough. No more, alright?}
{246}{}{好了，够了。不要了，好吗？}
#{247}{}{[As you get out of his lap, Sam instinctively tries to hold on to you and falls to the floor] What are you... No, no, we can't! It's forbidden! Get... Get out of here! GET OUT OF HERE!}
{247}{}{[当你从他的腿上下来，山姆本能地试图抓住你，然后摔倒在地上]你是什么。。。不，不，我们不能！这是禁止的！获取。。。离开这里！离开这里！}
#{248}{}{Okay, okay, I'm going.}
{248}{}{好吧，好吧，我要走了。}
#{249}{}{[Sam slowly slides his hands down your body, silently looking at you, but then looks down at his lap in panic] Ohh, what is this? What's happening to me?! [shoves you off him in panic] WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ME?! [stumbles to the corner, holding his crotch, and looks at you with wide eyes] Leave! Get out! GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!}
{249}{}{[山姆慢慢地把手放在你身上，默默地看着你，然后惊恐地看着他的膝盖]哦，这是什么？我怎么了？！[慌乱中把你推离他]我怎么了？！[跌跌撞撞地走到角落，抓住他的胯部，睁大眼睛看着你]离开！走出！滚出去！}
#{250}{}{I can't stop thinking out it. Listen, don't do that again, okay?}
{250}{}{我无法停止思考。听着，别再这样了，好吗？}
#{251}{}{That was so weird... Let's not do it again.}
{251}{}{太奇怪了。。。别再这样了。}
