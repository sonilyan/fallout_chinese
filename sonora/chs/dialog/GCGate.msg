### {260}{}{You mentioned some Jackals. Who is this?}
{260}{}{你提到了一些豺狼。这是谁？}

{261}{}{这个野蛮部落生活在沙漠中，但对他们几乎一无所知。我们所知道的是，这些都是狡猾的狗娘养的，他们引诱进入陷阱或攻击人群中虚弱的旅行者。}

{269}{}{真正地这改变了一切！听着，我们这里有几个家伙，他们已经考虑突袭豺狼很长时间了。如果你展示了巢穴，你们会更容易一起应对。}

### {310}{}{How does this city live? It doesn't look like maize is being grown here.}
{310}{}{这个城市生活得怎么样？这里看起来不像是在种玉米。}
### {311}{}{Are you kidding? The whole city is obliged to mine on the ruins. Scavengers mine old things there, and then the cartel sells them to caravans.}

### {312}{}{Who runs everything here?}
{312}{}{谁管理这里的一切？}

{316}{}{我们没有市长或治安官。拾荒者被分为部族，每个部族都有自己的首领。他们曾经服从Kogan先生，但在他去世后，城市里开始了一场争夺他的椅子的激烈斗争。}
### {317}{}{Tell me about yourself.}
{317}{}{告诉我你自己。}
### {318}{}{There's nothing to tell. I came with the others in the hope of making money on the mine. Fortunately, Mr. Kogan gave me a job as a gatekeeper. Now I make sure that no extra people go here, and scare away the animals.}
{318}{}{没什么好说的。我和其他人一起来是希望在矿场上赚钱。幸运的是，Kogan先生给了我一份看门人的工作。现在我确保没有多余的人来这里，吓跑动物。}
### {319}{}{And what kind of animals are found here?}
{319}{}{这里发现了什么样的动物？}
### {320}{}{Mostly coyotes and small radscorpions. Large rats can be found in the ruins. In general, this place will disappoint any trapper. They say that hunting is flourishing in the mountains in the east. I'm thinking about going there when it gets really bad in the Garage.}
{320}{}{主要是郊狼和小蝎子。废墟中可以找到大老鼠。总的来说，这个地方会让任何猎人失望。他们说东部山区的狩猎活动十分猖獗。当车库里的情况真的很糟糕的时候，我想去那里。}
### {321}{}{How old are these ruins?}
{321}{}{这些废墟有多古老？}

### {323}{}{What was here *before* The Great War?}
{323}{}{在大战之前这里是什么？}
### {324}{}{Some town called Kingman. But what's the difference? This is ancient history. Nobody cares anymore.}
{324}{}{一个叫金曼的小镇。但有什么区别呢？这是古老的历史。没人再在乎了。}
### {325}{}{Simple curiosity. Let's talk about something more important.}
{325}{}{单纯的好奇心。让我们谈谈更重要的事情。}
### {326}{}{Why do you live among all this junk?}
{326}{}{你为什么生活在这些垃圾堆里？}
### {327}{}{Do you have any better ideas? The old buildings are already unusable, we had to build new ones out of garbage.}
{327}{}{你有更好的主意吗？旧建筑已经无法使用了，我们不得不用垃圾建造新的。}

# About the slave convoy
### {330}{}{A slave convoy passed through here. You should know that.}
{330}{}{一支奴隶车队经过这里。你应该知道这一点。}

### {339}{}{Okay, I'll talk to the other residents.}

### {366}{}{Is there really no one here to fix this gun?}
