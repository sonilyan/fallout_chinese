{100}{}{Welcome, stranger. I'm Jacob and I run this bar. You want to order something?}
{101}{}{What drinks do you have?}
{102}{}{Do you have something to eat?}
{103}{}{Can I ask you something?}
{104}{}{No, thanks.}
#drinks...
{105}{}{Here's what I have for drink...}
{106}{}{(Beer..........$15)}
{107}{}{(Nuka Cola.....$10)}
{108}{}{(Booze.........$12)}
{109}{}{Actually I want to eat something.}
{110}{}{I'm not thirsty right now, can I ask you something?}
{111}{}{Thanks, see you later.}
#eat...
{112}{}{Alright, take a look at the menu...}
{113}{}{(Brahmin meat............$15)}
{114}{}{(Gecko-burger............$20)}
{115}{}{(Iguana-on-a-stick.......$25)}
{116}{}{What do you have for drink?}
{117}{}{I'm not hungry at the moment. Tell me something...}
{118}{}{Some other time, thanks.}
#ask...
{119}{}{I have very little time to chat with my customers, you know, I have a bar to run. But since you're new here...
 Alright we can talk. What about?}
{120}{}{What can you tell me about this place?}
{121}{}{Nothing, thanks for your time.}
#this place...
{122}{}{Most of the locals are workers. Some are still working in the mine, others left town or turned to more
 profitable jobs like trading. I was a miner once, but I've survived a great tragedy in the mine and promised myself
 never to work down there again. Later, with the help of the sheriff, I opened this bar. However, I've been concerned
 lately...}
{123}{}{What about that tragedy in the mine?}
{124}{}{What are you concerned about?}
{125}{}{You said some locals left the town, where to?}
{126}{}{Sorry, I have something else to do. Thanks for the story.}
#tragedy in the mine...
{127}{}{I'd rather not talk about it, but I'll tell you one thing. That mine isn't safe anymore, it never was, but it's
 more prone to collapsing than it was some thirty years ago. Especially in the last ten years the mine has expanded so
 rapidly... it just can't support the drilling anymore.}
{128}{}{I see, what about those who still work down there?}
{129}{}{Interesting. I must go now. Thanks for the story.}
#concerned about...
{130}{}{This town is losing population at an alarming rate. If this trend continues, I will not only lose all my
 customers, but the place itself will become a "ghost town". I'm not very optimistic...}
{131}{}{I admit it doesn't look good. Let me ask you something else.}
{132}{}{So it's that bad... Look, I have to go now, we'll talk some other time.}
#locals left town...
{133}{}{Far away from here, that's for sure. Many died in the wasteland. [Sighs.] They just weren't ready for the
 world out there. We could talk more about this but there's no point. I'll get back to my work now. Please, enjoy your
 stay in my bar.}
{134}{}{I will, see you later Jacob.}
#those who still work down...
{135}{}{Well, they know the risk, it is a dangerous job. I'm guessing they pray every night to a higher power because
 no one else listens. Some have no choice, others had to move on because they couldn't support their families anymore.
 The sheriff did everything in his power to help but this town depends very much on the mine's income. I even heard
 rumors about closing the mine because the coal reserves are, they think, running very low. If that happens, this town
 will be finished.}
{136}{}{I hope it won't be that way. Let me ask you something else instead.}
{137}{}{It does look like a tricky situation. I'll be going now, thanks for your time.}
#something else...
{138}{}{Alright, just keep in mind this is a bar not a chat room. So, you want to order something?}
#again...
{139}{}{Well, I'm glad to see you again. What would it be this time?}
{140}{}{Nothing.}
#dude evil...
{141}{}{I don't serve your kind.}
{142}{}{Sorry, I'm closed!}
{143}{}{You'll have to try somewhere else.}
{144}{}{No, I can't help you.}
#dude don't have money...
{145}{}{You have to pay for that.}
{146}{}{I'll be back with some money.}
#
{147}{}{Anything else?}
