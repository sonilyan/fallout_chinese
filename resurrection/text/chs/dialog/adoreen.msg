{150}{}{你看到了多琳。}
#{200}{}{You see a middle-aged woman. The few wrinkles on her face do little to diminish her attractiveness.}

#{400}{}{Guards!}

{501}{}{你是谁？}
#{502}{}{Whooo you?}
{502}{}{哇你？}
#{550}{}{My name is Doreen, I'm William's wife. And he doesn't like when strangers loiter among us. It's rude and stupid of you to ignore that.}

#{555}{}{Alright, I'm leaving.}
{555}{}{好吧，我要走了。}
#{600}{}{I'm talking about Penny, she's William's wife, like me. He met her in this city, after we moved here from Los Alamos. You could say he had an opportunity to get to know her better and found a liking to her.}
{600}{}{我说的是佩妮，她是威廉的妻子，和我一样。我们从洛斯阿拉莫斯搬到这里后，他在这座城市认识了她。你可以说他有机会更好地了解她，并且喜欢上了她。}

#{608}{}{I won't bother you any longer. Goodbye.}
{608}{}{我不会再打扰你了。再见。}
#{650}{}{William wants us to get along well, so that's what we do. But the way he acts around us also incites competition between us. He may not even realize that. He's very... [She tries to think of a fitting word.] thrifty. He doesn't give us much, but might give a small gift to the one that shows more affection. But I'm too old to compete for a man's attention with a younger woman, I have my dignity, and it wouldn't be fair to him.}
{650}{}{威廉希望我们好好相处，所以我们就这么做了。但他在我们身边的行为方式也煽动了我们之间的竞争。他可能甚至没有意识到这一点。他很…[她试图想出一个合适的词。]节俭。他给我们的不多，但可能会给表现出更多感情的人送些小礼物。但我太老了，不能和一个年轻的女人竞争一个男人的注意力，我有我的尊严，这对他不公平。}
#{651}{}{What do you mean?}

{658}{}{我不会再打扰你了。再见。}
#{700}{}{I believe Penny's just pretending, merely trying to get something. I doubt she has any feelings for him. I, on the other hand... You know, I didn't have a lot of choice in Los Alamos, but William was at least someone who could take care of me. And all those years created a certain bond.}
{700}{}{我相信佩妮只是在假装，只是想得到些什么。我怀疑她对他没有任何感觉。而我呢…你知道吗，我在洛斯阿拉莫斯没有太多选择，但威廉至少是能照顾我的人。这些年来，我们之间产生了某种联系。}

#{750}{}{It was my home, the ghouls destroyed it and captured or killed most of the people I knew. I don't want to talk about that.}

#{800}{}{If it's her you're interested in, you should just go talk to her. I'm sure she'll be glad for the company. I actually don't know much about her, except what they say in the city.
