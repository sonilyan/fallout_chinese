#{100}{}{You see William.}
{100}{}{你看到威廉了。}
#{101}{}{You see the eatery owner.}
{101}{}{你看到餐馆老板了。}
#{107}{}{[Make a bully face] Hey, didn't your mother ever tell you it's rude to stare? Stop it!}
{107}{}{[恶作剧]嘿，你妈妈没跟你说过盯着你不礼貌吗？住手！}
#{108}{}{Woah, there! Don't mind the rabble, you're safe here. How about you take a sandwich on the house, and we put this all behind us, huh?}
{108}{}{哇，好了！别介意那些乌合之众，你在这里很安全。不如你在家里吃个三明治，我们把这些都抛在脑后，好吗？}
#{109}{}{What the... Are you serious? [you hear laughing behind you] Hey, knock that off back there! Look, friend: If I have something you need, and you have something I need, then maybe we can work out a trade that's good for both of us. That's called bartering. Get it?}
{109}{}{怎么了。。。你是认真的吗？[你听到身后的笑声]嘿，别说了！听着，朋友：如果我有你需要的东西，你也有我需要的东西，那么也许我们可以达成一个对我们双方都有利的交易。那叫物物交换。了解了？}
#{110}{}{Hey there, friend! It's been too long since we had a new face around here. You here to barter? Don't be shy! I'm always happy to help out travelers, so long as they don't make trouble.}
{110}{}{嘿，朋友！我们已经很久没有新面孔了。你是来易货的？别害羞！我总是乐于帮助旅行者，只要他们不惹麻烦。}
#{111}{}{Barter? What's that?}
{111}{}{以货换货？那是什么？}
#{112}{}{Really? Well... Trading. If I have something you need, and you have something I need, then maybe we can work out a trade that's good for both of us. That's bartering. Get it?}
{112}{}{真正地？好。。。交易。如果我有你需要的东西，你也有我需要的东西，那么也许我们可以达成一个对我们双方都有利的交易。那是物物交换。了解了？}
#{113}{}{Makes sense. Let's trade.}
{113}{}{有道理。我们交易吧。}
#{114}{}{Not yet. I want to ask you about this place.}
{114}{}{还没有。我想问你关于这个地方的事。}
#{115}{}{Yeah, selection ain't great, I know. I'll have more next time... Er, I hope.}
{115}{}{是啊，我知道选择不太好。下次我会有更多的。。。呃，我希望。}
#{116}{}{Well, hey, friend! I'm happy to see ya!}
{116}{}{嘿，朋友！很高兴见到你！}
#{117}{}{Let's talk.}
{117}{}{我们谈谈。}
#{118}{}{What do you have for trade?}
{118}{}{你们有什么交易？}
#{119}{}{That's enough for today. Bye.}
{119}{}{今天就够了。再见。}
#{120}{}{What's that strange pistol?}
{120}{}{那把奇怪的手枪是什么？}
#{121}{}{Can we talk about that strange pistol I bought from you?}
{121}{}{我们能谈谈我从你那儿买的那把奇怪的手枪吗？}
#{122}{}{That's a jen-yoo-yine plasma pistol, very old model. One of the first to hit the civilian market, back before the war. It's a little banged up, but it does the job. Why?}
{122}{}{那是詹耀银等离子手枪，很旧的型号。其中最早冲击民用市场的，要追溯到战前。它有点坏了，但它能起作用。为什么？}
#{123}{}{Tell me more about that pistol.}
{123}{}{告诉我更多关于那把手枪的事。}
#{124}{}{That's all.}
{124}{}{这就是全部。}
#{125}{}{Belonged to a local, god rest his soul. Can't say I know much more about it, but Dave might. Me, I'm just the salesman.}
{125}{}{属于一个地方，上帝保佑他的灵魂。不能说我知道的更多，但戴夫可能知道。我，我只是个推销员。}
#{126}{}{How did you get it?}
{126}{}{你怎么得到的？}
#{127}{}{After raiders killed the owner, Dave and I split everything left in his tent. It wasn't much, I'll tell you that.}
{127}{}{袭击者杀了主人后，戴夫和我把他帐篷里剩下的东西都分了。我告诉你，那不算什么。}
#{128}{}{Interesting. Now, let's trade.}
{128}{}{很有趣。现在，让我们交易吧。}
#{129}{}{That's all I wanted. I'll be going now.}
{129}{}{这就是我想要的。我要走了。}
#{130}{}{Let's talk about something else.}
{130}{}{我们再谈点别的吧。}
#{131}{}{I want to ask you a few things about this place.}
{131}{}{我想问你一些关于这个地方的事情。}
#{132}{}{Such as?}
{132}{}{比如？}
#{133}{}{Do you have a water pump fuse here?}
{133}{}{这里有水泵保险丝吗？}
#{134}{}{Nah, nothing like that here. I'm mostly food and drink. Justin deals with all the complicated tech.}
{134}{}{不，这里没有这样的。我主要是吃喝。贾斯汀处理所有复杂的技术问题。}
#{135}{}{Right.}
{135}{}{正确的。}
#{136}{}{Something else?}
{136}{}{还有别的吗？}
#{137}{}{That's enough.}
{137}{}{够了。}
#{138}{}{Do you have any raiders around?}
{138}{}{你周围有袭击者吗？}
#{139}{}{Yeah, some local gang of scumbags. They live somewhere up in the mountains. No one knows anything about 'em.}
{139}{}{是啊，当地的一帮混蛋。他们住在山上的某个地方。没人知道他们的事。}
#{140}{}{Sure! I'm always happy to talk about our lovely commune Black Rock!}
{140}{}{当然！我总是很高兴谈论我们可爱的黑岩公社！}
#{141}{}{What can you tell me about this place's history?}
{141}{}{你能告诉我这个地方的历史吗？}
#{142}{}{Who's in charge? I'm new here and want to impress the right people.}
{142}{}{谁负责？我是新来的，想给合适的人留下深刻印象。}
#{143}{}{Do you have any *serious* work for me here?}
{143}{}{你这儿有我的工作吗？}
#{144}{}{Hey, it's all serious! But if you want something big, a caravan merchant told me that "Nevada Express" needs an investigator, though it was a while ago. You can find them in Reno. Work around here is a little more laid back... But at least you'll have friendly coworkers!}
{144}{}{嘿，都是认真的！但是如果你想要大的东西，一个商队商人告诉我“内华达快车”需要一个调查员，尽管那是很久以前的事了。你可以在雷诺找到它们。这里的工作比较轻松。。。但至少你会有友好的同事！}
#{145}{}{Who's that quiet guy in the leather jacket?}
{145}{}{那个穿皮夹克的安静的家伙是谁？}
#{146}{}{Don't know. Came up with a caravan a while back, hardly says a word except to buy food and drink. I figure he'll move on soon.}
{146}{}{不知道。前段时间我开了一辆大篷车，除了买食物和饮料，几乎什么也没说。我想他很快就会离开。}
#{147}{}{That'd be me and Justin! I take care of the food, and Justin keeps the water and electricity running. Justin's, uh... A lot less welcomin' than I am, but we can always find a common ground when it's for the good of the community.}
{147}{}{那就是我和贾斯汀！我负责食物，贾斯汀负责水和电的供应。贾斯汀，呃。。。比我受的欢迎少了很多，但我们总能找到一个共同点，那是为了社区的利益。}
#{148}{}{What are you talking about then?}
{148}{}{那你在说什么？}
#{149}{}{Whatever you say.}
{149}{}{不管你说什么。}
#{150}{}{Do you know anything about bikers?}
{150}{}{你知道摩托车手吗？}
#{151}{}{They pass through here, from time to time. What do you want to know?}
{151}{}{他们不时经过这里。你想知道什么？}
#{152}{}{Who are they?}
{152}{}{他们是谁？}
#{153}{}{Do they have some sort of base?}
{153}{}{他们有什么基础吗？}
#{154}{}{What do you think of them?}
{154}{}{你觉得他们怎么样？}
#{155}{}{What do you know about the attack on "Nevada Express"?}
{155}{}{你对“内华达快车”的袭击了解多少？}
#{156}{}{That will be enough. Thank you.}
{156}{}{那就够了。非常感谢。}
#{157}{}{Tell me, did a biker named Jay Kukish come through here recently?}
{157}{}{告诉我，最近有个叫杰伊・库基什的摩托车手来过这里吗？}
#{158}{}{Yeah, he did! Stocked up on food and left in a hurry.}
{158}{}{是的，他做到了！囤积食物匆匆离去。}
#{159}{}{Do you have any idea where he went?}
{159}{}{你知道他去哪儿了吗？}
#{160}{}{Good question. Hmm... I've heard of bikers zooming around Nevada and California on their bikes, living free by their own philosophy and making their own fate. So - that's not about these ones. The ones that roll in here are pretty much just a gang, consisting from not-so-bad guys, who doesn't give two shits about anything, except themselves. Does that answer your question?}
{160}{}{问得好。隐马尔可夫模型。。。我听说过骑自行车的人骑着自行车在内华达州和加利福尼亚州转悠，按照自己的理念自由生活，创造自己的命运。所以-那不是关于这些。在这里打滚的人基本上只是一个帮派，由不太坏的家伙组成，除了他们自己，他们什么都不在乎。这回答了你的问题吗？}
#{161}{}{Beats me! If they do, they don't tell just anyone. I know they usually come from the east and south, but there's a helluva lot of space to hide a base in the Great Nevada circle.}
{161}{}{打败我了！如果他们这样做了，他们不会告诉任何人。我知道他们通常来自东部和南部，但是在大内华达圈有很大的空间来隐藏基地。}
#{162}{}{Great Nevada circle?}
{162}{}{大内华达圈？}
#{163}{}{That's what we call the highways between Salt Lake City, Vegas and Reno. Lot of travelers along those roads, and that means there's plenty of bandits, too. Step off road, though, and you're fighting the wasteland for your life.}
{163}{}{这就是我们所说的盐湖城、维加斯和雷诺之间的高速公路。沿途有很多旅行者，这意味着那里也有很多强盗。不过，离开这条路，你就在为你的生命和荒地战斗。}
#{164}{}{They're not bad people. They got a lot of spirit and don't make trouble, so I like 'em. I make 'em pay up front for beer though, if you know what I mean.}
{164}{}{他们不是坏人。他们很有精神，不惹麻烦，所以我喜欢他们。我让他们先付啤酒钱，如果你明白我的意思的话。}
#{165}{}{I heard someone hit a "Nevada Express" transport east of here. It could be raiders, but the "Express" blames the bikers. I don't really know the details, but it's a strange story.}
{165}{}{我听说有人撞了这里东边的一辆内华达快车。它可能是袭击者，但“快车”指责骑自行车的人。我真的不知道细节，但这是个奇怪的故事。}
#{166}{}{Can you show me where the attack took place?}
{166}{}{你能告诉我袭击发生在哪里吗？}
#{167}{}{Sure! [he shows you the location on your map]}
{167}{}{当然！[他告诉你地图上的位置]}
#{168}{}{I could, but I'm not sure I should. Why should I trust you??}
{168}{}{我可以，但我不确定我应该。我为什么要相信你？？}
#{169}{}{What if I pay you?}
{169}{}{如果我付钱给你呢？}
#{170}{}{Give me fifty bucks and I'll point it out for you.}
{170}{}{给我五十块钱，我给你指出来。}
#{171}{}{Sounds great! [takes your money and shows you the location on your map]}
{171}{}{听起来很棒！[拿着你的钱，告诉你地图上的位置]}
#{172}{}{He was heading south when he left. Wherever he's going, he'll definitely make a stop off in Reno.}
{172}{}{他离开时正向南走。不管他去哪里，他肯定会在雷诺停留。}
#{173}{}{Thanks for your help.}
{173}{}{谢谢你的帮助。}
#{180}{}{I have gecko's balls... I mean, eggs.}
{180}{}{我有壁虎的蛋蛋。。。我是说，鸡蛋。}
#{181}{}{Hey, great! I'll give you fifty bucks a pop for 'em!}
{181}{}{嘿，太好了！我给你五十块一瓶！}
#{182}{}{Why are you buying them?}
{182}{}{你为什么要买它们？}
#{183}{}{Then take everything I have.}
{183}{}{那就拿走我所有的东西。}
#{184}{}{I'll think about it.}
{184}{}{我会考虑的。}
#{185}{}{Well, I hope you think fast... }
{185}{}{好吧，我希望你快点想。。。}
#{186}{}{Because caravan merchants from Reno will buy them for more. They pay top dollar for 'em, because they're hard to get. So i'm buying and reselling. Luckily, they are easy to preserve for long-term.}
{186}{}{因为里诺的商队商人会以更高的价格购买它们。他们花高价买的，因为很难买到。所以我买了又卖。幸运的是，它们很容易长期保存。}
#{187}{}{Fair deal! Thanks.}
{187}{}{公平交易！谢谢。}
#{188}{}{Hey, didn't your mother ever tell you it's mean to play tricks on people?}
{188}{}{嘿，你妈妈没告诉过你捉弄人是卑鄙的吗？}
#{189}{}{I don't remember that... }
{189}{}{我不记得了。。。}
#{190}{}{}
{190}{}{}
#{191}{}{There ain't much to tell. Black Rock was some sort of huge junkyard before the war. At least, we figured it was a junkyard. It was all full of these weird metal shapes and structures. They looked like they were made by a junkie.}
{191}{}{没什么好说的。黑岩在战前是一个巨大的垃圾场。至少，我们认为那是个垃圾场。里面全是奇怪的金属形状和结构。看起来像是瘾君子做的。}
#{192}{}{[More]}
{192}{}{[更多]}
#{193}{}{We heard someone was living here all by himself, and realized we could make ourselves a community here, away from "civilization". Life was pretty shitty in the big cities back then, so we wanted a fresh start.}
{193}{}{我们听说有人独自住在这里，意识到我们可以在这里建立一个社区，远离“文明”。那时大城市的生活很糟糕，所以我们想要一个新的开始。}
#{194}{}{[More]}
{194}{}{[更多]}
#{195}{}{So we came here, scrapped those strange structures and built our homes. More people came, with brahmin and tents. That's how we became a stop for travelers and caravan merchants.}
{195}{}{所以我们来到这里，拆除那些奇怪的建筑，建造我们的家园。更多的人来了，带着婆罗门和帐篷。这就是为什么我们成为旅行者和商队商人的一站。}
#{196}{}{Thanks.}
{196}{}{谢谢。}
#{197}{}{Don't mention it!}
{197}{}{不用谢！}
#{198}{}{Sounds more like it was a collection of sculptures than a junkyard, don't you think?}
{198}{}{听起来更像是一堆雕塑而不是垃圾场，你不觉得吗？}
#{199}{}{You mean, like an art expo? Hmm... You know, you just might be right!}
{199}{}{你是说，像艺术博览会？隐马尔可夫模型。。。你知道，你可能是对的！}
#{200}{}{It seems like things don't go well around here. Can I help you with anything?}
{200}{}{好像这里的情况不太好。有什么需要我帮忙的吗？}
#{201}{}{[He raises an eyebrow] Well, I don't know what you have in mind, but if you want to help, I'd love if you could do something for poor Jasmine.}
{201}{}{[他扬起眉毛]我不知道你在想什么，但如果你想帮忙，我很乐意你能为可怜的茉莉做点什么。}
#{202}{}{Who?}
{202}{}{谁？}
#{203}{}{Nevermind then.}
{203}{}{那就别管了。}
#{204}{}{Hmm.}
{204}{}{隐马尔可夫模型。}
#{205}{}{[He sighs] That poor, poor girl. Her father brought her here from Reno. Would have been a great fresh start, but he died in a gecko hunt, and Jasmine's got these nasty blisters on her skin. Some kind of disease, we think.}
{205}{}{那个可怜的女孩。她父亲从雷诺带她来的。本来是个很好的新开始，但他死于猎杀壁虎，而茉莉的皮肤上有这些讨厌的水泡。我们认为是某种疾病。}
#{206}{}{And?}
{206}{}{然后呢？}
#{207}{}{Justin says we should burn her alive, to keep anyone else getting sick, like in the old days. But he doesn't have the guts to do it. Me? I think we are better than that. Don't want to have evil gossips about our little town spreading around.}
{207}{}{贾斯汀说我们应该活活烧死她，让其他人不生病，就像过去一样。但他没有勇气这么做。我？我认为我们比这更好。不想让关于我们小镇的流言蜚语四处传播。}
#{208}{}{What can I do?}
{208}{}{我能做什么？}
#{209}{}{Well, let me be clear: we can't do much for her. We are lacking not only a doctor, but even the meds. But if you can find some way to cure her, I'll pay you for your trouble.}
{209}{}{好吧，让我说清楚：我们不能为她做太多。我们不仅缺少医生，连药品都缺。但如果你能想办法治好她，我会赔偿你的麻烦。}
#{210}{}{I'll see what I can do.}
{210}{}{我看看我能做什么。}
#{211}{}{I'm afraid I can't help you.}
{211}{}{恐怕我帮不了你。}
#{212}{}{I understand. Just forget it.}
{212}{}{我理解。算了吧。}
#{213}{}{I'm happy to hear that! Just don't say anything to Justin. He hates Jasmine.}
{213}{}{听到这个我很高兴！别跟贾斯汀说什么。他讨厌茉莉花。}
#{220}{}{About Jasmine... }
{220}{}{关于茉莉花。。。}
#{221}{}{Yeah?}
{221}{}{是 啊？}
#{222}{}{She's dead.}
{222}{}{她死了。}
#{223}{}{Oh, nothing.}
{223}{}{哦，没什么。}
#{224}{}{I managed to cure her. She's not infectious anymore.}
{224}{}{我设法治好了她。她不再有传染性了。}
#{225}{}{Dead?! She didn't deserve that! [he sighs] Well, at least there's no risk of gettin' sick now. I bet Justin will be happy to hear this.}
{225}{}{死了？！她不配那样！好吧，至少现在没有生病的危险。我打赌贾斯汀会很高兴听到这个。}
#{226}{}{Didn't you promise me a reward?}
{226}{}{你没答应给我报酬吗？}
#{227}{}{Bye.}
{227}{}{再见。}
#{228}{}{Yeah, for curing her! You think I'm happy to hear about her death? She didn't ask to be sick. If you want a reward for what you did to a vulnerable girl, ask Justin. You'll get nothing from me.}
{228}{}{是啊，为了治好她！你觉得我很高兴听到她的死？她没有要求生病。如果你想因为你对一个脆弱的女孩所做的事得到奖励，去问贾斯汀。你从我这里什么也得不到。}
#{229}{}{Fine.}
{229}{}{好的。}
#{230}{}{Hot damn! You've got no idea how thankful I am to hear that. Here, take something for your expenses - [he gives you fifty dollars] - and some food and drink, on the house. You earned it!}
{230}{}{他妈的火辣！你不知道听到这个我有多感激。来，拿点东西作为你的开销-[他给你五十美元]-还有一些食物和饮料，在房子上。你应得的！}
#{231}{}{You're welcome.}
{231}{}{不客气。}
#{232}{}{Fine.}
{232}{}{好的。}
#{233}{}{William, I'm sorry, but this cost me a lot more than that... }
{233}{}{威廉，我很抱歉，但这比那花了我很多钱。。。}
#{234}{}{I'm sorry too, but I'm not rich. I gave you everything I could.}
{234}{}{我也很抱歉，但我并不富有。我给了你我能给的一切。}
#{235}{}{Fine.}
{235}{}{好的。}
#{236}{}{Oh... That's awkward. Hmm... I think I can spare another fifty bucks. Don't worry, I can make that back. But I can't give you more, sorry.}
{236}{}{哦。。。太尴尬了。隐马尔可夫模型。。。我想我可以再省50块钱。别担心，我会回来的。但我不能给你更多，对不起。}
#{237}{}{Thank you.}
{237}{}{非常感谢。}
#{238}{}{You earned 50 experience points for a successful use of trading skill.}
{238}{}{成功使用交易技能获得50点经验值。}
#{239}{}{She left.}
{239}{}{她走了。}
#{240}{}{Without even saying goodbye? Hmm... I guess that's not a surprise, with the way everyone here treated her. Gravedigger Bob's the only one that had soft spot for her. Well, what's done is done.}
{240}{}{甚至不说再见？隐马尔可夫模型。。。我想这并不奇怪，这里的每个人都这样对待她。掘墓人鲍勃是唯一对她有好感的人。好吧，做了就做了。}
#{250}{}{Is there anything else I can do to help out?}
{250}{}{还有什么我能帮忙的吗？}
#{251}{}{Yeah, actually. We could use a fresh point of view on something.}
{251}{}{是的，事实上。我们可以用新的观点来看待一些事情。}
#{252}{}{Tell me.}
{252}{}{告诉我。}
#{253}{}{A couple of fugitive slaves blew into town recently. Poor fellas must've made a long, tough journey to get away from whoever was the owner, but we don't know how they can be useful around here, or even can they just be trusted. Justin thinks it's dangerous just havin' them here. We need a neutral party to figure out if we should keep them here, or send them on their way.}
{253}{}{最近有几个逃亡的奴隶闯进了城里。可怜的家伙们一定经历了一段漫长而艰难的旅程来摆脱主人，但我们不知道他们在这里有什么用处，甚至不知道他们是否值得信任。贾斯汀认为把他们留在这里很危险。我们需要一个中立的政党来决定是让他们留在这里，还是让他们上路。}
#{254}{}{I'll do it.}
{254}{}{我会的。}
#{255}{}{No thanks. Fugitive slaves aren't my thing.}
{255}{}{不用了，谢谢。我不喜欢逃亡奴隶。}
#{256}{}{About those fugitive slaves... }
{256}{}{关于那些逃亡的奴隶。。。}
#{257}{}{What do you think?}
{257}{}{你怎么认为？}
#{258}{}{They'll work for almost nothing, besides food and a roof over their heads. They'll be very useful to Black Rock.}
{258}{}{除了食物和屋顶，他们几乎什么也不干。它们对黑岩非常有用。}
#{259}{}{They're dead. It's better for everyone this way, believe me.}
{259}{}{他们死了。相信我，这样对每个人都好。}
#{260}{}{}
{260}{}{}
#{261}{}{I sent them away. They would have brought slavers here.}
{261}{}{我把他们打发走了。他们会把奴隶贩子带到这里来。}
#{262}{}{I17m still working on it.}
{262}{}{我还在努力。}
#{263}{}{That's just what I wanted to hear! And it's not about cheap labor either - we're all equal here. It's about safety - and if you're telling me they're trustworthy and won't bring slavers, then I'm more than happy.}
{263}{}{这正是我想听的！这也不是廉价劳动力的问题――我们在这里都是平等的。这关系到安全――如果你告诉我他们是值得信赖的，不会带奴隶贩子来，那我就非常高兴了。}
#{264}{}{Good.}
{264}{}{很好。}
#{265}{}{Dead?! Goddamn... You didn't do it, did you? No, don't tell me. I don't want to know. [he sighs] Well, at least Justin will be happy... }
{265}{}{死了？！他妈的。。。不是你干的，是吗？不，别告诉我。我不想知道。好吧，至少贾斯汀会高兴的。。。}
#{266}{}{Haven't I earned anything for my trouble?}
{266}{}{我没有为我的麻烦赚点什么吗？}
#{267}{}{}
{267}{}{}
#{268}{}{}
{268}{}{}
#{269}{}{Come to think of it, the slavers could pick up the trail of runaway slaves and make their way to Black Rock. That would be not good, even considering we can defend ourselves. So, looks like we are better off without slaves. And I'm especially glad this was solved peacefully.}
{269}{}{想想看，奴隶主们可以找到逃跑奴隶的踪迹，然后前往黑岩。即使考虑到我们可以自卫，那也不好。看来没有奴隶我们过得更好。我特别高兴这件事和平解决了。}
#{270}{}{Great.}
{270}{}{伟大的。}
#{271}{}{Thank you for deep understanding of the situation, that is very valuable. Take a sandwich - you must be hungry after all that running around.}
{271}{}{感谢您对形势的深刻了解，那是非常有价值的。吃个三明治吧，你跑了这么久一定饿了。}
#{272}{}{Thanks.}
{272}{}{谢谢。}
#{273}{}{Well, at least it's something.}
{273}{}{好吧，至少有点道理。}
#{274}{}{Great! You'll find them huddled around a fire, in front of Jed's house. Just don't say anything to Justin - he just wants them gone.}
{274}{}{太好了！你会发现他们围着一堆火，在杰德的房子前面。别跟贾斯汀说什么-他只是想让他们走。}
#{275}{}{We'll see.}
{275}{}{我们拭目以待。}
#{276}{}{Yeah, no. Sorry, but I didn't ask for anyone to turn up dead! What will people think about what we do with visitors? I suppose, Justin would be glad to hear it from you though.}
{276}{}{是的，没有。对不起，我没有要求任何人死！人们会怎么看待我们如何对待来访者？我想，贾斯汀会很高兴听到你这么说的。}
#{277}{}{Geez... }
{277}{}{天啊。。。}
#{278}{}{Thanks for doing such a good job. Take a sandwich and a beer - you must be hungry after all that running around.}
{278}{}{谢谢你做得这么好。吃个三明治，喝杯啤酒――跑了这么久，你一定饿了。}
#{300}{}{Is there anything else I can do?}
{300}{}{还有什么我能做的吗？}
#{301}{}{About that missing brahmin... }
{301}{}{关于那个失踪的婆罗门。。。}
#{302}{}{}
{302}{}{}
#{303}{}{I won't lie - that business with the slaves didn't do much for your reputation. But I think I've got something for you.}
{303}{}{我不会撒谎的-和奴隶做生意对你的名誉没什么好处。但我想我有东西要给你。}
#{304}{}{I was hoping you'd ask that! After how you dealt with those escaped slaves, I've got something right up your alley.}
{304}{}{我希望你会问这个！在你处理了那些逃跑的奴隶之后，我有一些事情正适合你。}
#{305}{}{What is it?}
{305}{}{这是怎么一回事？}
#{306}{}{So here's the deal: my boy watches the brahmin at night, but a few days ago I woke up to see we're missing one. Justin says it's my son's fault, but I don't think so. I need someone to get to the bottom of this.}
{306}{}{这么说吧：我儿子晚上看婆罗门，但几天前我醒来发现我们少了一个。贾斯汀说这是我儿子的错，但我不这么认为。我需要有人来查清真相。}
#{307}{}{I think I can handle that.}
{307}{}{我想我能应付。}
#{308}{}{Sorry, pal, but I have other problems right now.}
{308}{}{抱歉，伙计，我现在还有其他问题。}
#{309}{}{Great! I'll make it worth your while, believe me! The brahmin pen's right out behind the eatery. My son's out there now.}
{309}{}{太好了！相信我，我会让你觉得值得的！婆罗门笔就在餐厅后面。我儿子现在在外面。}
#{310}{}{Just wait, I will go talk to him.}
{310}{}{等等，我去和他谈谈。}
#{311}{}{Any news?}
{311}{}{有消息吗？}
#{312}{}{Nothing yet.}
{312}{}{还没有。}
#{313}{}{Does anyone in Black Rock use shotgun shells filled with rusty nails?}
{313}{}{在黑岩有人用装满生锈钉子的霰弹枪吗？}
#{314}{}{Hmm, that's a good question... It's hard to get ammunition out here, so we usually save it for special occasions. If anyone's making ammo, Justin would know. He has all the town's tools and machinery.}
{314}{}{嗯，这是个好问题。。。这里很难弄到弹药，所以我们通常把它留到特殊场合。如果有人在制造弹药，贾斯汀会知道的。他拥有镇上所有的工具和机器。}
#{315}{}{That's all the information I needed.}
{315}{}{这就是我需要的全部信息。}
#{316}{}{I found the thief.}
{316}{}{我找到了小偷。}
#{317}{}{Who?! Who did it?}
{317}{}{谁？！是谁干的？}
#{318}{}{[Tell him the whole story.]}
{318}{}{[告诉他整个故事。]}
#{319}{}{...and he poisoned my son?! That bastard! I took him in, I trusted him like family! How could that backstabbing son of a bitch do this to me?!}
{319}{}{…他毒死了我儿子？！那个混蛋！我收留了他，我像家人一样信任他！那混蛋怎么能这样对我？！}
#{320}{}{}
{320}{}{}
#{321}{}{You should consider, that they would have killed him, if he didn't do what they said. It's difficult to do something your way, when you are being pointed with a shotgun. He was a prisoner of the situation, can't you see?}
{321}{}{你应该想想，如果他不照他们说的做，他们会杀了他。当别人用猎枪指着你时，你很难按自己的方式做事。他是那种情况下的囚犯，你看不出来吗？}
#{322}{}{He's dangerous. Just his presence attracts raiders. We have to get rid of him.}
{322}{}{他很危险。他的出现吸引了袭击者。我们必须除掉他。}
#{323}{}{You mean I should forgive him? After what he's done? [he puts a hand on his chin and frowns] Well... He was forced to do it. And this gang, the Molerats - they don't fuck around. No, he's as much a victim as I am. Yes... I forgive him, he can stay with us. And about brahmin - I think he'll make up for it in time.}
{323}{}{你是说我应该原谅他？在他做了什么之后？[他把手放在下巴上皱眉头]嗯。。。他被迫这么做。而这帮人，那些猥亵的人-他们不会到处乱搞。不，他和我一样是受害者。对。。。我原谅他，他可以和我们在一起。关于婆罗门-我想他会及时弥补的。}
#{324}{}{Good. I'll go tell him the good news.}
{324}{}{很好。我去告诉他这个好消息。}
#{325}{}{Yes... Yes, you're right. Maybe he left the gang, but it hasn't left him. I don't like it, but... We have to make him leave.}
{325}{}{对。。。是的，你说得对。也许他离开了那帮人，但那帮人没有离开他。我不喜欢，但是。。。我们必须让他离开。}
#{326}{}{Remember, this was your decision. I'll go tell him now.}
{326}{}{记住，这是你的决定。我现在就去告诉他。}
#{327}{}{Wait! I promised you a reward. Take some money and a sandwich and beer on the house. Thanks for your hard work, friend.}
{327}{}{等待！我答应给你报酬的。带点钱，三明治和啤酒在家里。谢谢你的辛勤工作，朋友。}
#{328}{}{You're welcome.}
{328}{}{不客气。}
#{350}{}{Any more work?}
{350}{}{还有工作吗？}
#{351}{}{About that courier... }
{351}{}{关于那个信使。。。}
#{352}{}{You're a machine, ain'tcha? Okay, one more thing. It's a little more complicated than the last ones, but after Bolt and the slaves I'm pretty sure you can handle it.}
{352}{}{你是个机器，不是吗？好吧，还有一件事。这比上一次要复杂一点，但在博尔特和奴隶们之后，我很肯定你能应付。}
#{353}{}{Don't worry. I can do it.}
{353}{}{别担心。我能做到。}
#{354}{}{Great! A courier is scheduled to make a delivery, but he's a couple days late. Someone needs to find him and the packages he was carrying. He can't be too far. What do you say?}
{354}{}{太好了！一个快递员预定要送货，但他晚了几天。得有人找到他和他带的包裹。他不会太远的。你怎么说？}
#{355}{}{I'll do my best.}
{355}{}{我会尽力的。}
#{356}{}{Run around the desert, looking for a mailman? Not today.}
{356}{}{在沙漠里到处跑，找邮递员？今天不行。}
#{357}{}{Excellent! The courier's name is Milo. He was coming from Gerlach, so I'd start looking there. Ask around and see if anyone knows anything.}
{357}{}{杰出的！快递员叫米洛。他是从杰拉克来的，所以我要开始找他。四处打听，看看有没有人知道什么。}
#{358}{}{I have more questions about this job.}
{358}{}{我对这份工作有更多的问题。}
#{359}{}{I'll see what I can do.}
{359}{}{我看看我能做什么。}
#{360}{}{Ask away.}
{360}{}{去问吧。}
#{361}{}{[Sighs] I heard Evan had an accident. That's bad news, but the package should still be on its way.}
{361}{}{我听说埃文出事了。这是个坏消息，但包裹应该还在路上。}
#{362}{}{Tell me more about this courier.}
{362}{}{告诉我更多关于这个信使的事。}
#{363}{}{He goes by Milo. He lives in Gerlach, but he makes deliveries here. Not a lot to say about him - quiet, professional... That's about it. Pretty much what a courier should be.}
{363}{}{他叫米洛。他住在格拉赫，但他在这里送货。关于他没什么好说的-安静，专业。。。就这样。差不多是个信使。}
#{364}{}{What was he delivering?}
{364}{}{他在送什么？}
#{365}{}{Gecko skins from Evan. Before you ask - yes, we got our own hunters, but Evan is a real master. His skins are better than anyone else's in these parts.}
{365}{}{埃文的壁虎皮。在你问之前-是的，我们有自己的猎人，但埃文是一个真正的大师。他的皮肤比其他任何人都好。}
#{366}{}{Tell me about Gerlach.}
{366}{}{告诉我杰拉克的事。}
#{367}{}{It's to the west from here. A small place, kind of like ours - though a hell of a lot more strict. It's named after its founder, Mr. Gerlach. He's still in charge, last I've heard.}
{367}{}{从这里往西走。一个很小的地方，有点像我们的――虽然严格得多。它是以它的创始人格拉赫先生命名的。据我所知，他仍然是负责人。}
#{368}{}{What's my reward?}
{368}{}{我的报酬是什么？}
#{369}{}{Look, I get that you need a reward for this, but a man's life is at stake here! Find him first, and then we'll talk about payment, alright?}
{369}{}{听着，我知道你需要一个奖励，但是这里有一个人的生命危险！先找到他，然后我们再谈付款，好吗？}
#{370}{}{Okay, I'll go look for him.}
{370}{}{好吧，我去找他。}
#{371}{}{Still can't find an elephant in the desert? ...sorry, bad joke.}
{371}{}{在沙漠里还是找不到大象。。。抱歉，这个坏笑话。}
#{372}{}{I found the courier... Or what's left of him.}
{372}{}{我找到了信使。。。或者他剩下什么。}
#{373}{}{He's dead? Damn, poor Milo. What happened?}
{373}{}{他死了？该死，可怜的麦洛。怎么搞的？}
#{374}{}{The hit to the head with shovel, that's what happened. He was murdered by Eugene and the Molerats gang.}
{374}{}{用铲子打到头部，就是这样。他被尤金和黑帮谋杀了。}
#{375}{}{He was, uh, eaten by geckos. Bob and I already buried him.}
{375}{}{他被壁虎吃掉了。鲍勃和我已经把他埋了。}
#{376}{}{You already told me about that. Wanna say something new?}
{376}{}{你已经告诉我了。想说点新的吗？}
#{377}{}{Actually, I lied before.}
{377}{}{事实上，我以前撒过谎。}
#{378}{}{No, nothing.}
{378}{}{不，没什么。}
#{379}{}{Milo was a good man - too good to go out like that. I hope his wife is holding up alright. [he sighs] Well, thanks for lettin' me know. Here's a hundred bucks. I'd love to give you more, but without Milo's delivery I'm gonna be pretty lean on cash for the next little while. Sorry.}
{379}{}{米洛是个好人――太好了，不能那样出去。我希望他妻子能挺过来。谢谢你让我知道。这是一百美元。我很想给你更多，但是没有米洛的送货，我在接下来的一段时间里会非常依赖现金。对不起的。}
#{380}{}{At least it's something.}
{380}{}{至少它是个东西。}
#{381}{}{What do you mean?}
{381}{}{什么意思？}
#{382}{}{Milo was murdered by Eugene and the Molerats gang. He was killed with a shovel.}
{382}{}{米洛被尤金和黑帮谋杀了。他被铲子打死了。}
#{383}{}{I'm going to gather more evidence and come back. See you.}
{383}{}{我要收集更多的证据回来。再见。}
#{384}{}{Oh my god! I had no idea! Look, we can't waste any more time, let's go talk to Justin and Eugene right now.}
{384}{}{哦，我的上帝！我不知道！听着，我们不能再浪费时间了，我们现在就去和贾斯汀和尤金谈谈。}
#{385}{}{If you're sure... }
{385}{}{如果你确定。。。}
#{386}{}{[After a huge scandal you and William return to the bar] That fucking family, I swear! One of these days... Look, forget about them for now. We've got a caravan from Reno on the way and Eugene's gang is planning to ambush it. We've got to stop them, but we can't do it by ourselves. We've only got one hope... }
{386}{}{[在一个巨大的丑闻之后你和威廉回到酒吧]那个该死的家庭，我发誓！总有一天。。。听着，暂时忘掉他们。我们有一辆来自里诺的大篷车在路上，尤金的帮派正计划伏击它。我们必须阻止他们，但我们自己做不到。我们只有一个希望。。。}
#{387}{}{We're going to save the caravan?}
{387}{}{我们要救大篷车？}
#{388}{}{I managed to get Eugene's radio. Take it. If you can get the right frequency, you can overhear talks of these scumbags about their plans, and warn the caravan. It doesn't have a long range, so you'll have to be fast and careful.}
{388}{}{我设法弄到了尤金的收音机。拿去吧。如果你能得到正确的频率，你可以无意中听到这些人渣谈论他们的计划，并警告商队。它没有很长的射程，所以你必须快速小心。}
#{389}{}{Hey, I never said I was going to do this!}
{389}{}{嘿，我从没说过我会这么做！}
#{390}{}{I'll do my best.}
{390}{}{我会尽力的。}
#{391}{}{I'm not asking you to go get in a fight! Just warn the caravan before the gang gets to them. No one but you can do it. We'll discuss your reward later.}
{391}{}{我不是要你去打架！在那帮人找到他们之前警告他们。只有你能做到。我们稍后再讨论你的报酬。}
#{392}{}{I'll think about it.}
{392}{}{我会考虑的。}
#{393}{}{Then I'll go now. I'll be back as soon as I can.}
{393}{}{那我现在就走。我会尽快回来的。}
#{394}{}{I managed to knock the Molerats' codenames and frequencies out from Eugene. Take them. You'll be able to overhear their communications and warn the caravan. The range isn't great, so be quick and careful. Good luck.}
{394}{}{我设法从尤金那里敲出了鼹鼠的代号和频率。拿着它们。你就能偷听到他们的通讯并警告商队。范围不大，所以要迅速小心。祝你好运。}
#{395}{}{Hey, it's you! The caravan merchants told me everything! You're a goddamn miracle worker, you know that?! Great job!}
{395}{}{嘿，是你！商队的商人告诉了我一切！你他妈是个奇迹工作者，你知道吗？！干得好！}
#{396}{}{Such words would go perfectly with reward.}
{396}{}{这样的话会得到很好的回报。}
#{397}{}{I'm glad I could help.}
{397}{}{我很高兴能帮上忙。}
#{398}{}{You're not even asking for a reward? That's noble! Look, from now on, I'm giving you a 20% discount on my trading goods. You're welcome here any time, remember that!}
{398}{}{你不是在要求报酬吗？太高尚了！看，从现在起，我的交易商品给你打八折。随时欢迎你来，记住！}
#{399}{}{You know, you could give me something more for my troubles... }
{399}{}{你知道，你可以给我更多的东西来解决我的麻烦。。。}
#{400}{}{Thanks for the discount. I wish you the best!}
{400}{}{谢谢你的折扣。祝你一切顺利！}
#{401}{}{Without Evan's skins, I don't have much. I can give you two hundred bucks and a 20% discount in my eatery. Keep me in mind if you're ever in the area!}
{401}{}{没有埃文的皮，我没有多少。我可以在我的餐厅给你两百块和八折。如果你来过这里，请记住我！}
#{402}{}{What if you give me that old energy pistol instead?}
{402}{}{如果你把那把旧手枪给我呢？}
#{403}{}{I need money. Give me everything you can.}
{403}{}{我需要钱。尽你所能给我。}
#{404}{}{Keep the money, I don17t need it.}
{404}{}{把钱留着，我不需要。}
#{405}{}{You already bought it, remember? Or do you think I have two? Well, sorry, but I don't.}
{405}{}{你已经买了，记得吗？或者你认为我有两个？嗯，对不起，但我不知道。}
#{406}{}{Take care.}
{406}{}{当心。}
#{407}{}{Now that's a damn fine idea. Who else would want this piece of junk around here? Take it and enjoy.}
{407}{}{好主意。还有谁会想要这片垃圾呢？好好享受吧。}
#{408}{}{That's all I can do. Sorry it's not much.}
{408}{}{我只能这么做。对不起，不多。}
#{409}{}{Well, it's something, at least. Take care!}
{409}{}{好吧，至少是这样。当心！}
#{410}{}{I knew you'd say that! Heroes don't need money, right? Okay, okay, that's a joke. I'm serious about that discount, though!}
{410}{}{我就知道你会这么说！英雄不需要钱，对吧？好吧，好吧，那是个玩笑。不过，我是认真的！}
#{411}{}{I will remember that. Now I have to go.}
{411}{}{我会记住的。现在我得走了。}
#{412}{}{Well, that's it. The caravan's not coming back. All the work I put in was for nothing. [he sighs] Maybe Justin was right.}
{412}{}{好吧，就这样。商队不会回来了。我投入的所有工作都是徒劳的。也许贾斯汀是对的。}
#{413}{}{Maybe you'll learn something from this - don't trust anyone. I'll be on my way.}
{413}{}{也许你会从中学到一些东西-不要相信任何人。我马上就来。}
#{414}{}{I don't care, this is your problem.}
{414}{}{我不管，这是你的问题。}
#{415}{}{Yeah... Yeah. But we tried, right?}
{415}{}{是 啊。。。是 啊。但我们试过了，对吧？}
#{416}{}{Right. I came for business.}
{416}{}{正确的。我是来办事的。}
#{417}{}{Whatever. I have to go.}
{417}{}{无论什么。我得走了。}
#{420}{}{Oh, yeah... Here's a hundred bucks for finding Milo. I'm sorry it's not much, but without Evan's skins I don't have much to spare.}
{420}{}{哦，是的。。。给你一百块钱找米洛。很抱歉，这不多，但没有埃文的皮我就没有多少多余的了。}
#{421}{}{Fine.}
{421}{}{好的。}
#{500}{}{News? Let me think.}
{500}{}{新闻？让我想想。}
#{501}{}{Well, what's new?}
{501}{}{有什么新鲜事吗？}
#{502}{}{Let's see, what else is new... }
{502}{}{让我们看看，还有什么新的。。。}
#{503}{}{A traveler told me something yesterday... }
{503}{}{一个旅行者昨天告诉我。。。}
#{504}{}{I've got news from the wasteland! Who wants to hear?}
{504}{}{我从荒地得到消息了！谁想听？}
#{505}{}{The scariest thing in the desert is sandstorms.}
{505}{}{沙漠里最可怕的是沙尘暴。}
#{506}{}{We need some better booze up in here... }
{506}{}{我们这里需要更好的酒。。。}
#{507}{}{That iguana-hunting wanderer's been missing for a while. We should look for him around town.}
{507}{}{那个猎捕鬣蜥的流浪者失踪了一段时间。我们应该在城里到处找他。}
#{510}{}{Finally, someone's brought the Molerats to justice!}
{510}{}{终于，有人把那些猥亵者绳之以法了！}
#{511}{}{We won't have to worry about the Molerats anymore.}
{511}{}{我们就不用再担心那些老鼠了。}
#{512}{}{It's about time someone took care of those Molerats.}
{512}{}{是时候有人来照顾那些鼹鼠了。}
#{513}{}{Damn those Molerats. This is only going to get worse.}
{513}{}{该死的那些老鼠。这只会变得更糟。}
#{514}{}{After what happened to the caravan, the Molerats are capable of anything.}
{514}{}{在大篷车出了什么事之后，鼹鼠们什么都能干。}
#{516}{}{The Molerats still control the south of our valley.}
{516}{}{鼹鼠仍然控制着我们山谷的南部。}
#{517}{}{They say there are not much left of the Molerats, but they're still dangerous.}
{517}{}{他们说鼹鼠已经所剩无几了，但它们仍然很危险。}
#{520}{}{They say the Cheyenne won't last much longer. Soon, they'll only be a memory.}
{520}{}{他们说夏延河不会持续太久。很快，它们只会成为记忆。}
#{521}{}{If Big Louie's Dogs beat the Cheyenne, what will they do to us?}
{521}{}{如果大路易的狗打败夏延人，他们会对我们做什么？}
#{522}{}{We'd have more caravans around here if not for Big Louie's Dogs.}
{522}{}{如果不是大路易的狗，我们这里会有更多的商队。}
#{523}{}{It's a good idea to steer clear of the Cheyenne these days.}
{523}{}{现在避开夏延河是个好主意。}
#{524}{}{If you don't like raiders, give Lovelock a wide berth.}
{524}{}{如果你不喜欢掠夺者，给洛夫洛克一个宽大的铺位。}
#{525}{}{Who wanted to go to Cheyenne here? You might want to rethink that. The raiders have gone completely berserk.}
{525}{}{谁想在这里去夏延？你应该重新考虑一下。袭击者已经完全发狂了。}
#{526}{}{Who wanted to go to Cheyenne? Good news, the raiders are no longer a problem!}
{526}{}{谁想去夏延？好消息，袭击者已经不是问题了！}
#{527}{}{Finally, Big Louie's Dogs are dead. That should make the roads a lot safer.}
{527}{}{最后，大路易的狗死了。那会使道路更安全。}
#{528}{}{Lovelock is a lot more peaceful with Big Louie out of the picture.}
{528}{}{洛夫洛克在大路易出局的时候会平静很多。}
#{529}{}{They say Gerlach's still going strong. That guy is tough!}
{529}{}{他们说杰拉克还是很强壮。那家伙很厉害！}
#{530}{}{Anyone heading to our neighbors to the west?}
{530}{}{有人去我们西边的邻居家吗？}
#{531}{}{Gerlach... It's sad to hear that our neighbors are no more.}
{531}{}{杰拉克。。。听说我们的邻居都不在了，真难过。}
#{532}{}{Gerlach's gone real quiet. There's something shady going on, if you ask me.}
{532}{}{杰拉克变得很安静。如果你问我的话，有什么可疑的事情发生了。}
#{533}{}{Gerlach's practically abandoned. Everyone went somewhere else, but no one knows where.}
{533}{}{杰拉克几乎被抛弃了。每个人都去了别的地方，但没人知道在哪里。}
#{540}{}{Did you hear about the "Nevada Express"? Don't come near the place - it's very dangerous!}
{540}{}{你听说过“内华达快车”吗？别靠近那地方-那很危险！}
#{541}{}{I didn't think anyone could attack the "Nevada Express" and win.}
{541}{}{我不认为有人能攻击“内华达快车”并获胜。}
#{542}{}{I wouldn't be surprised if the "Nevada Express" was set up.}
{542}{}{如果“内华达快车”成立了，我也不会感到惊讶。}
#{550}{}{They say Reno's pretty unsettled now. But then, when wasn't it?}
{550}{}{他们说雷诺现在很不安。但是，那不是什么时候？}
#{551}{}{Better stay away from Reno. There's some real shit going down, I hear.}
{551}{}{最好离雷诺远点。我听说真的发生了什么事。}
#{552}{}{They say Reno hasn't been this bad since the war.}
{552}{}{他们说雷诺从战后就没这么坏过。}
#{553}{}{They say Reno's really settled down lately. Maybe we should go back?}

#{554}{}{It sounds like Reno is finally getting better.}
{554}{}{听起来雷诺终于好起来了。}
#{555}{}{I heard the gang war in Reno is finally over!}
{555}{}{我听说雷诺的帮派战争终于结束了！}
#{560}{}{A traveler told me there's some sort of oasis in the mountains. Interesting stuff.}
{560}{}{一个旅行者告诉我山上有一片绿洲。有趣的东西。}
#{561}{}{You get some real crazy stories in here. How could there be a city up north in the mountains?}
{561}{}{你这里有很多疯狂的故事。怎么会有一座城市在山的北边？}
#{562}{}{They say there's a city just like before the war in the mountains. That can't be true.}
{562}{}{他们说在山里有一座和战前一样的城市。那不可能是真的。}
#{563}{}{Did you hear about that Oasis City, where everyone wears blue jumpsuits? Yeah, I don't believe it either.}
{563}{}{你听说过绿洲城吗，那里每个人都穿蓝色连身衣？是啊，我也不相信。}
#{570}{}{Did anyone catch Mike's fight? It must have been a hell of a show!}
{570}{}{有人看到迈克打架了吗？那一定是一场精彩的演出！}
#{571}{}{Bob says someone's been digging up the graves. I'm worried about him... }
{571}{}{鲍勃说有人在挖坟墓。我很担心他。。。}
#{572}{}{Fugitive slaves? Well, what about them? They're people too! Just give them a chance!}
{572}{}{逃亡奴隶？那他们呢？他们也是人！给他们一个机会！}
#{573}{}{Fugitive slaves? Well, there is not much to talk about now.}
{573}{}{逃亡奴隶？现在没什么好谈的了。}
#{574}{}{Yeah, that brahmin situation was awkward.}
{574}{}{是啊，婆罗门的处境很尴尬。}
#{1116}{}{Well, hey, friend! I'm happy to see ya!}
{1116}{}{嘿，朋友！很高兴见到你！}
#{1261}{}{I sent them away. They would have brought slavers here.}
{1261}{}{我把他们打发走了。他们会把奴隶贩子带到这里来。}
#{1271}{}{Thanks for dealing with this. Take a sandwich - you must be hungry after all that running around.}
{1271}{}{谢谢你处理这件事。吃个三明治吧，你跑了这么久一定饿了。}
#{1278}{}{Thanks for doing such a good job. Take a sandwich and a beer - you must be hungry after all that running around.}

#{1377}{}{Actually, I lied before.}
{1377}{}{事实上，我以前撒过谎。}

#{1407}{}{Now that's a damn fine idea. Who else would want this piece of junk around here? Take it and enjoy.}
{1407}{}{好主意。还有谁会想要这片垃圾呢？好好享受吧。}
