{360}{}{好吧，那你想想，我会回来的。}
#{361}{}{Because I??m hooked, okay? I can't earn shit... The first time was a fluke! Fuck those mechanics, I hope they become impotent. I hope their dicks stay limp until the day they die!}

#{373}{}{Shit, where??s my money... }
{373}{}{妈的，我的钱呢...}
#{374}{}{[You watch as the gambler loses more of your money. Soon, you identify the pattern: the machine feeds a few small wins to the player, then gives nothing but losses thereafter.

{374}{}{[你看着赌徒输掉你更多的钱。很快，你就发现了模式：机器给玩家提供了一些小的胜利，之后除了损失什么也不给。你可以看出这不是随机的；这种模式是相当有规律的，并且在玩家的“连胜”中进行了明确的调整，以最大限度地提高他们的情感投入，然后开始只会带来损失。]}

Though, I won??t be allowed to play here anymore. Once again I thank you - here is your money... And here's that extra I promised you. That??s it, I don't need to sit in this shithouse for a minute longer! The lights of Vegas await me!}
{1416}{}{我的天使！你去哪里了？我在考虑派个人去追你！让我开门见山-我做到了！我把这该死的赌场打扫干净了...不过，我不能再在这里玩了。我再次感谢你-这是你的钱...这是我答应你的额外费用。就这样，我不需要再在这个破房子里坐一分钟了！拉斯维加斯的灯光在等着我！}
#{1421}{}{You know, I saw how that mechanic removed the counter from the machine. I guess you really scared those fuckers upstairs good! This is great, I can win my money back for sure now... Though, not right away, of course.}
{1421}{}{你知道，我看到那个机修工把柜台从机器上拆了下来。我猜你真的把楼上那些混蛋吓坏了！太好了，我现在肯定能赢回我的钱...当然，不是马上。}
