### {111}{}{Well, the history of this place is quite interesting. This vault was build to be a shelter during the war.

{111}{}{这个地方的历史很有趣。这个拱顶是在战争期间建造的。但正如我们在挖掘下面计算机中存储的数据时发现的那样，它有自己的黑暗秘密。除了保护人民免受外界的伤害，它还被政府用作某种实验设施。。。 -- Well, the history of this place is quite interesting.

{112}{}{什么样的实验？ -- What kind of experiments?}
### {113}{}{When the war reached its height, the government became desperate for any new weapon and started to experiment on people. The people in this vault to be precise.

{113}{}{当战争达到高潮时，政府迫切需要任何新武器，并开始在人民身上进行实验。确切地说是这个金库里的人。他们希望开发出一种能在几秒钟内杀死人的生物武器。。。数百人在测试中死亡。一些人出现了可怕的突变，而另一些人。。。事实上，大多数人在最终去世前都经历了痛苦的折磨。 -- When the war reached its height, the government became desperate for any new weapon and started to experiment on people.

{115}{}{有人在实验中幸存下来吗？ -- Did anyone survive the experiments?}
### {116}{}{Some escaped the vault and allied themselves against normal humans. Their struggle against us lasted for decades, but I couldn't find anything about the outcome.

I actually saw something larger than any man I know, covered with branches as a camouflage, moving in the woods during my last week's patrol... or maybe it was one of those ape man things, you know... from the old books. Anyway, if it gets closer to my flamethrower next time, I'll say Eat fire, Darwin prick! [Smiles.]}
{116}{}{一些人逃离了金库，与普通人结盟。他们与我们的斗争持续了几十年，但我找不到任何结果。我想这是历史上被遗忘已久的一部分，没有人愿意回忆。事实上，在我上周的巡逻中，我看到了一个比我认识的任何人都大的东西，上面覆盖着树枝作为伪装，在树林里移动。。。或者这可能是猿人的一件事，你知道。。。来自旧书。不管怎样，如果下次它离我的火焰喷射器越来越近，我会说，吃火吧，达尔文混蛋！[微笑。] -- Some escaped the vault and allied themselves against normal humans.
