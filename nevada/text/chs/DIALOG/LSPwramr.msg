#{110}{}{There are parts of dilapidated power armor on the table.}
{110}{}{桌子上有一些破旧的动力装甲。}
#{111}{}{Inspect the damages closely.}
{111}{}{仔细检查损坏情况。}
#{112}{}{Conduct an initial analysis of the possibility to repair.}
{112}{}{对修复的可能性进行初步分析。}
#{113}{}{Leave the parts on the table.}
{113}{}{把零件放在桌子上。}
#{114}{}{Apparently, this exemplar of rare battle equipment had a little to no luck during the Great War: the helmet is almost destroyed, the back is mangled, together with the power module, and, of course, the most "spicy" part - the CPU - is done too. To restore THIS, you will need a whole factory... Or at least spare parts for replacement.}
{114}{}{很明显，这个罕见的战斗装备的例子在大战期间有点运气不佳：头盔几乎被摧毁，背部和电源模块一起破损，当然，最“辛辣”的部分――CPU――也完成了。要恢复这个，你需要一个完整的工厂。。。或者至少是替换的备件。}
#{115}{}{To restore the armor, you require not only replacements for some parts, but also very high skills in system engineering (that is, to put it simply, repair and science.)}
{115}{}{为了修复装甲，你不仅需要更换某些部件，还需要非常高的系统工程技能（简单地说，就是维修和科学）}

#{119}{}{Use the broken armor.}

#{121}{}{Do nothing and leave the parts on the table.}

#{122}{}{After working all day on the armor, you still got a positive result - supporting structure is restored! This is a big step forward. But that's not enough for full repair.}
{122}{}{在盔甲上工作了一整天之后，你仍然得到了一个积极的结果――支撑结构恢复了！这是向前迈出的一大步。但这还不足以完全修复。}
#{123}{}{Ugh, it's a really hard work...}

#{130}{}{Begin the second stage of repairing - the restoration of integrity.}

#{131}{}{There is nothing left of the old power armor that could be used to restore integrity. Will have to look for a replacement for layers of gas and radiation protection, and a hermetic helmet.}
{131}{}{旧的能量护甲已经没有什么可以用来恢复完整性了。将不得不寻找一个替代层的气体和辐射防护，以及一个密封头盔。}

{150}{}{开始第三阶段的修复-电力系统的恢复。}
#{151}{}{The situation is more complicated than expected. The armor is nearly destroyed with the most complex internal structure, in particular the autonomous system and CPU. You need to replace them, with the usage of corresponding blueprints as well.}
{151}{}{情况比预期的要复杂。装甲几乎被摧毁，内部结构最复杂，特别是自治系统和CPU。你需要用相应的蓝图来替换它们。}

#{155}{}{Spinning the last screw in the armor, you look in awe at the finished armor on the table. You walk a couple steps back, stopping motionless, like a connoisseur of art in front of antique painting.}
{155}{}{旋转盔甲上的最后一颗螺丝，你敬畏地看着桌子上完成的盔甲。你向后走了几步，一动不动地停了下来，就像一个艺术鉴赏家在古董画前。}
