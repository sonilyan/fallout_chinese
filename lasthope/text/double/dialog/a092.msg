{100}{}{Welcome customer, looks like this is your first time here. Before we proceed, a friendly suggestion, keep your
 hands where I can see them and don't touch anything you're not supposed to. Now, what can I do for you?}
{101}{}{What do you sell here?}
{102}{}{Can you tell me something about this place?}
{103}{}{Nothing right now.}
#sell here...
{104}{}{We sell lots of stuff you won't find just anywhere. Our sales network spreads wide across the wasteland. We
 pay well to our suppliers and we expect the same from our customers because it's all about quality! Now, let me show
 you our stock...}
{105}{}{Alright.}
{106}{}{Not right now, let me ask you something.}
#something...
{107}{}{Yes, what can I help you with?}
{108}{}{Show me your stuff.}
{109}{}{Tell me something about this place.}
{110}{}{Actually, I don't need anything right now.}
#about this place...
{111}{}{Well, the history of this place is quite interesting. This vault was build to be a shelter during the war. But as
 we found out while digging through the data stored in the computers below, it had its own dark secret. Besides
 protecting the people from the outside world, it was also used by the government as some kind of experiment
 facility...}
{112}{}{What kind of experiments?}
#
{113}{}{When the war reached its height, the government became desperate for any new weapon and started to
 experiment on people. The people in this vault to be precise. They hoped to develop a biological weapon that could
 kill within seconds... hundreds died during the tests. Some developed hideous mutations while others... well, the
 most actually, went through agonizing suffering before their eventual death.}
{114}{}{What about those with mutations?}
{115}{}{Did anyone survive the experiments?}
#mutants...
{116}{}{Some escaped the vault and allied themselves against normal humans. Their struggle against us lasted for
 decades, but I couldn't find anything about the outcome. I guess it's a long forgotten part of history that nobody wants
 to recall. I actually saw something larger than any man I know, covered with branches as a camouflage, moving in the
 woods during my last week's patrol... or maybe it was one of those ape man things, you know... from the old books.
 Anyway, if it gets closer to my flamethrower next time, I'll say "Eat fire, Darwin prick!" [Smiles.]}
{117}{}{Say, can you point out where you have seen this thing?}
{118}{}{Interesting, can I ask you something?}
{119}{}{Thanks for the story, I must be going now.}
#where...
{120}{}{Sorry stranger, I can't give you any information about our patrol routes. It's classified.}
{121}{}{That experiments you were talking about, any survivors?}
{122}{}{I see, let me ask you something.}
#survivors from experiments...
{123}{}{Except those mutants that escaped? No, nothing in the records... probably covered up. Poor bastards...}
{124}{}{Yep, let me ask you something else.}
#something else...
{125}{}{Sure, what can I do for you?}
{126}{}{Show me your stuff.}
{127}{}{Can you tell me something about this place?}
{128}{}{Nothing right now.}
#again...
{129}{}{Welcome again stranger, what can I offer you today?}
#
{130}{}{Thank you for your time, anything else?}
{131}{}{I want to take another look at your goods.}
{132}{}{I'm fine, see you later.}
#classified...
{133}{}{Well, I could pay you for that information...?}
#
{134}{}{Haha, I know you can. But I have my orders, so you better keep that money and your mouth shut. Alright?}
{135}{}{Uh... OK.}
