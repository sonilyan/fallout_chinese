#{100}{}{You see Avanigizhig the Foggy Day, the Cheyenne shaman.}
{100}{}{你看到阿瓦尼吉希，雾天，夏延萨满。}
#{101}{}{You see a gray-haired man in dirty clothes with a faraway look in his eye.}
{101}{}{你看到一个头发花白，穿着脏衣服的人，眼睛里有一种遥不可及的神情。}
#{102}{}{What is this? Potions for the body? Thank you, but I have my own.}
{102}{}{这是什么？身体药剂？谢谢，但我有我自己的。}
#{110}{}{Spirits do not speak to the one who has the breath of fire in their nose. Neither do I.}
{110}{}{灵魂不会对鼻子里有火焰气息的人说话。我也是。}
#{111}{}{These substances allow the Devourer into your body and mind! I will not speak to you while you are under their power.}
{111}{}{这些物质允许吞食者进入你的身体和心灵！你在他们的权力之下，我不会和你说话。}
#{112}{}{This is a place of peace, not war. We will not speak with weapons in hand.}
{112}{}{这是一个和平的地方，不是战争。我们不会拿着武器说话。}
#{113}{}{The Ruler of Life advises us to solve our problems with words, not weapons.}

#{114}{}{May happiness come to you. My days are limited, but the road is long ahead of you. Thank you for everything.}

#{116}{}{Good luck to you. And don??t visit Canada. Ever.}
{116}{}{祝你好运。不要去加拿大。永远不会。}
#{120}{}{Bad deeds!}
{120}{}{坏事！}
#{121}{}{By doing evil to me, you have brought evil upon yourself!}
{121}{}{你向我作恶，就是害自己！}
#{122}{}{What is your tribe?}
{122}{}{你的部落是什么？}
#{123}{}{I see the gaze of the Devourer in your eyes!}
{123}{}{我在你眼中看到了吞噬者的凝视！}
#{124}{}{My curse will follow you forever! Not even death will release you!}
{124}{}{我的诅咒将永远伴随着你！即使死亡也不能释放你！}
#{125}{}{You??re just a worm in the Devourer's leavings!}
{125}{}{你只不过是吞食者留下的一条虫子！}
#{126}{}{Your tribe can be respected.}
{126}{}{你的部落可以得到尊重。}
#{130}{}{Stop, wanderer! I am only an old man, and I have nothing. Do not let evil spirits guide you... }
{130}{}{站住，流浪汉！我只是一个老人，一无所有。别让恶魔指引你...}
#{131}{}{I don't. Why would you say that?}
{131}{}{我不知道。你为什么这么说？}
#{132}{}{Those are the only spirits I respect! You got a problem with that?}
{132}{}{这些是我唯一尊敬的灵魂！你有意见吗？}
#{133}{}{Fine, I'll be on my way then.}
{133}{}{好吧，那我就上路了。}
#{134}{}{I see darkness deeper than the night inside of you. Just to look at it hurts me. [he sighs] Well, perhaps a wanderer must walk in darkness these days, after the Devourer spilled from his insides withering fire across the world... }
{134}{}{我看到黑暗比你内心的黑夜更深。只是看着它伤害我。[他叹息]好吧，也许一个流浪者必须在黑暗中行走这些天，在吞食者从他的内心喷发出枯萎的火焰遍布世界之后...}
#{135}{}{Exactly. Now, will you answer my questions?}
{135}{}{确切地。现在，你能回答我的问题吗？}
#{136}{}{Uh-huh. I think your brain's past its expiration date.}
{136}{}{啊哈。我想你的大脑已经过期了。}
#{137}{}{Let's just leave it at that.}
{137}{}{就这样吧。}
#{138}{}{Everything has its time. Mine is coming soon.}
{138}{}{每件事都有它的时间。我的马上就要来了。}
#{139}{}{You're not easy to piss off, huh? Forget it, I'm going.}
{139}{}{你不容易生气，是吗？算了，我要走了。}
#{140}{}{Good. I??m glad to hear it.}
{140}{}{很好。我很高兴听到这个消息。}
#{141}{}{I want to ask you something.}
{141}{}{我想问你一件事。}
#{142}{}{In that case, I'll see you later.}
{142}{}{那样的话，回头见。}
#{143}{}{Hmm... I see a child of the Devourer and, at the same time, a friend of the Cheyenne. I hope you continue to walk the bright path, wanderer... }
{143}{}{Hmm...我看到了一个吞食者的孩子，同时也是夏延人的朋友。我希望你继续走光明的路，流浪者...}
#{144}{}{Our humble camp is open to you, wanderer, so long as you come in peace.}
{144}{}{我们简陋的营地对你开放，流浪者，只要你能平安地来。}
#{145}{}{It is a happy day when you come to our camp, wanderer. How can an old shaman help you?}
{145}{}{流浪汉，你来到我们的营地真是快乐的一天。一个老巫师怎么能帮你？}
#{150}{}{[The old man looks like a ghost among the graves. His hollow eyes stare hopelessly into emptiness.] Wh... Who's there?}
{150}{}{[老人在坟墓里像个幽灵。他空洞的眼睛绝望地凝视着空虚...谁在那儿？}
#{151}{}{What are you doing here, old man? Planning to dig someone up? Or do you just like to hang around corpses?}
{151}{}{你在这里干什么，老头子？打算挖人吗？或者你只是喜欢和尸体混在一起？}
#{152}{}{I'm just out for a walk. What are you doing among the graves?}
{152}{}{我只是出去走走。你在坟墓里干什么？}
#{153}{}{Look out, I'm the Devourer! Boo-oo-oo! [leave]}
{153}{}{小心，我是吞食者！呜呜呜！[离开]}
#{154}{}{I was just going. [exit]}
{154}{}{我正要去。[退出]}
#{155}{}{[He looks at you for some time. You notice tears in his eyes.] Leave me!}
{155}{}{[他看了你一段时间。你注意到他眼中的泪水了]离开我！}
#{156}{}{Shut your mouth, while you still have some teeth left!}
{156}{}{闭上你的嘴，趁你还有牙齿！}
#{157}{}{Easy, easy. I??m leaving.}
{157}{}{放松，放松。我要走了。}
#{158}{}{[He looks at you for some time. You notice tears in his eyes.] What am I doing?... I don't know... }
{158}{}{[他看了你一段时间。你注意到他眼里含着泪水。]我在做什么？...我不知道...}
#{159}{}{Memory problems, old man?}
{159}{}{记忆有问题吗，老头？}
#{160}{}{Maybe I shouldn't ask. Forgive me.}
{160}{}{也许我不该问。原谅我。}
#{161}{}{Actually, I don't really want to know. See you.}
{161}{}{事实上，我真的不想知道。再见。}
#{162}{}{Leave me! Leave!}
{162}{}{离开我！快走！}
#{163}{}{I shouldn't have asked, forgive me. Did something happen?}
{163}{}{我不该问的，原谅我。发生什么事了吗？}
#{164}{}{Nothing. It's me that needs forgiveness... I gave myself to oblivion, and because of it, I lost my sight... }
{164}{}{没有什么。是我需要宽恕...我把自己遗忘了，因为它，我失去了视力...}
#{165}{}{What happened?}
{165}{}{怎么搞的？}
#{166}{}{Gladly.}
{166}{}{很高兴。}
#{170}{}{Nothing... I always come here at night, and I can never remember why. Something inside me is tearing my soul to pieces. I know the Ruler of Life cares for our dead, but... How much suffering must we endure as a result of the white man's greed?}
{170}{}{没有什么...我总是在晚上来这里，我永远都不记得为什么。我内心的某些东西正在把我的灵魂撕成碎片。我知道生命的统治者关心我们的死者，但是...由于白人的贪婪，我们必须忍受多少痛苦？}
#{171}{}{Are you talking about raiders?}
{171}{}{你说的是袭击者吗？}
#{172}{}{"White man's greed"? What are you talking about?}
{172}{}{“白人的贪婪”？你在说什么？}
#{173}{}{What problems have you had with the white man?}
{173}{}{你和那个白人有什么问题？}
#{174}{}{Show us proper respect, you scum! We are the dogs protecting your flock. Without us, you'd have been eaten by wolves a long time ago.}
{174}{}{尊重我们，你这个人渣！我们是保护你们羊群的狗。如果没有我们，你早就被狼吃掉了。}
#{175}{}{Why don't you get rid of them?}
{175}{}{你为什么不把它们处理掉？}
#{176}{}{I'm not interested in this right now.}
{176}{}{我现在对这个不感兴趣。}
#{177}{}{Yes, Ogima thinks so, too. This is truth... The truth in captivity.}
{177}{}{是的，奥吉玛也这么认为。这是事实...被囚禁的真相。}
#{178}{}{Raiders, may the Devourer damn them. One day, they came for another raid and never left.}
{178}{}{掠夺者，愿吞噬者诅咒他们。一天，他们又来了一次突袭，再也没有离开。}
#{179}{}{}
{179}{}{}
#{180}{}{Our ancestors told us that our people were always persecuted, even when gold ruled these lands. That's why, when the Last Day came, our people hid in the mountains. But even though the times have changed, the people remain the same.}
{180}{}{我们的祖先告诉我们，我们的人民总是受到迫害，即使在黄金统治这些土地的时候。这就是为什么，当最后一天到来时，我们的人民躲在山里。但是，即使时代变了，人民仍然是一样的。}
#{181}{}{The truth is, the Devourer will always make more children. They will come and replace the ones he has lost. We cannot defeat this truth by ourselves. We can only hope for the Ruler of Life's mercy.}
{181}{}{事实是，吞食者总会生更多的孩子。他们会来代替他失去的人。我们自己无法战胜这个真理。我们只能寄希望于生活的统治者的仁慈。}
#{182}{}{You don't have to wait much longer. I am that mercy.}
{182}{}{你不用等太久。我就是那种仁慈。}
#{183}{}{[His eyes blaze] So Ogima made that decision, did he? The one I couldn't make? Then, good! Do it for us, wipe them off the face of the earth! Take blood for blood!}
{183}{}{所以奥吉玛做了那个决定，是吗？我做不到的那个？那么，很好！为我们做吧，把他们从地球上抹去！以血换血！}
#{184}{}{Fine. But I could use some help.}
{184}{}{好的。但我需要一些帮助。}
#{185}{}{I'll go think about my strategy then.}
{185}{}{那我就去考虑我的策略。}
#{186}{}{Do my ears deceive me? Or... Does the big raider's right hand seek to test me? Then tell him we are taught to be careful.}
{186}{}{我的耳朵欺骗了我吗？或者...大突袭者的右手想测试我吗？然后告诉他我们被教导要小心。}
#{187}{}{From me? I'm old. But our warrior Gekek, who watches the entrance, can show you the way to their camp. I can only give you wisdom: do not attack them directly. They are strong fighters. But even the greatest warrior's throat may be cut if caught unaware.}
{187}{}{从我这里？我老了。但是我们的战士盖克，他看着入口，可以带你去他们的营地。我只能给你智慧：不要直接攻击他们。他们是强壮的战士。但即使是最伟大的战士，如果不知情也可能被割喉。}
#{188}{}{I understand... I think. I'll talk to Gekek.}
{188}{}{我理解...我想。我去和盖克谈谈。}
#{189}{}{Be careful, wanderer.}
{189}{}{小心点，流浪汉。}
#{190}{}{Of course.}
{190}{}{当然。}
#{191}{}{Is that so? I've never seen an outsider help our people without reward. Perhaps the time has come... }
{191}{}{是这样吗？我从没见过外人无偿帮助我们的人民。也许是时候了...}
#{192}{}{[The old man is clearly depressed. He looks like a ghost among the graves.]}
{192}{}{[老人显然很沮丧。他看起来像坟墓里的鬼魂}
#{193}{}{[Leave]}
{193}{}{[离开]}
#{194}{}{How can you live with raiders?}
{194}{}{你怎么能和袭击者住在一起？}
#{195}{}{Ogima is a cunning speaker. To keep the axe of war locked away, we give the raiders tribute and leave us in peace. Mostly. It is not pleasant, but if we break the deal, it will be much worse.}
{195}{}{奥吉玛是个狡猾的演说家。为了把战斧锁起来，我们向袭击者进贡，让我们和平共处。基本上。这并不令人愉快，但如果我们违反协议，情况会更糟。}
#{196}{}{(mumbles something) And our paths cross once again... }
{196}{}{（喃喃自语）我们的道路再次交汇...}
#{197}{}{I would like to ask you something.}
{197}{}{我想问你一件事。}
#{198}{}{...and once again, diverge.}
{198}{}{……再一次，分道扬镳。}
#{199}{}{Shh! Now is not the time to talk, wanderer. I must complete my daily ritual.}
{199}{}{嘘！现在不是谈话的时候，流浪者。我必须完成每天的例行公事。}
#{200}{}{Some other time then.}
{200}{}{那就改天吧。}
#{201}{}{I have never seen anything like this - a child of the Devourer, helping people like us. You give me much to think about, wanderer.}
{201}{}{我从没见过这样的事――一个吞食者的孩子，帮助我们这样的人。你让我想的太多了，流浪汉。}
#{202}{}{Everyone! Our hero returns!}
{202}{}{所有人！我们的英雄回来了！}
#{203}{}{Our paths cross again. What will this bring today?}
{203}{}{我们的路又交叉了。今天会带来什么？}
#{204}{}{I should go. Take care.}
{204}{}{我该走了。当心。}
#{205}{}{Do you know? The raiders are no more!}
{205}{}{你知道吗？掠夺者不在了！}
#{206}{}{What will you do now that the raiders are gone?}
{206}{}{既然袭击者不见了，你怎么办？}
#{207}{}{There should be a radio station near here. Where is it?}
{207}{}{这附近应该有个电台。它在哪里？}
#{208}{}{}
{208}{}{}
#{209}{}{}
{209}{}{}
#{210}{}{Hmm... That place is normally forbidden to outsiders. Only there, may we be alone to perform our most sacred worship. But you deserve our trust, wanderer. I cannot take you, but I will tell you where it is.}
{210}{}{Hmm...那个地方通常禁止外人进入。只有在那里，我们才能独自一人进行我们最神圣的崇拜。但你值得我们信任，流浪者。我不能带你去，但我会告诉你在哪儿。}
#{211}{}{Fine, I'll find it myself.}
{211}{}{好吧，我自己去找。}
#{212}{}{}
{212}{}{}
#{213}{}{}
{213}{}{}
#{214}{}{}
{214}{}{}
#{215}{}{Word of it is spreading throughout the wasteland! Thank you! I am finally ready for my final journey, when I will go to the spirits of my loved ones and leave the tribe to the young.}
{215}{}{消息传遍了整个荒地！谢谢您！我终于为我的最后一次旅程做好了准备，那时我将走向我所爱的人的灵魂，把部落留给年轻人。}
#{216}{}{}
{216}{}{}
#{217}{}{Speaking of the young, do you think they'll make it?}
{217}{}{说到年轻人，你认为他们会成功吗？}
#{218}{}{I'm glad to see you're doing well. Stay healthy.}
{218}{}{我很高兴看到你做得很好。保持健康。}
#{219}{}{They have a lot to learn. Like walking through a mine field, some make it through by luck, and some avoid it altogether, but we, the old ones, have led them safely through these years. But when I meet my ancestors, I will tell them our young will find their path, as they taught us to.}
{219}{}{他们有很多东西要学。就像走过一片雷区，有些人侥幸通过，有些人则完全避开，但我们这些老家伙，这些年来一直带领他们安全度过。但当我遇到我的祖先，我会告诉他们，我们的年轻人会找到他们的道路，因为他们教导我们。}
#{220}{}{You're a shaman. You know more than most of your fellow tribesman. Can you tell me the history of this place?}
{220}{}{你是个萨满。你知道的比你的大多数同族人都多。你能告诉我这个地方的历史吗？}
#{221}{}{Can you tell me the history of this place again?}
{221}{}{你能再告诉我一次这个地方的历史吗？}
#{230}{}{We lived far to the north-east, in the mountains. Our tribe survived there afer the Last Day.}
{230}{}{我们住在遥远的东北部山区。我们的部落最后一天在那里幸存了下来。}
#{231}{}{How did you made such a long journey?}
{231}{}{你怎么走了这么长的路？}
#{232}{}{We came most of the way on a train, but the rails were not strong enough. It left its tracks on the borders of Nevada, near Salt Lake City.}
{232}{}{我们大部分时间是乘火车来的，但铁轨不够坚固。它在靠近盐湖城的内华达州边界留下了足迹。}
#{233}{}{Tell me more about those times.}
{233}{}{告诉我更多关于那些时代的事。}
#{234}{}{Why did you leave your lands?}
{234}{}{你为什么离开你的土地？}
#{235}{}{Salt Lake City? Where is that?}
{235}{}{盐湖城？那是哪里？}
#{236}{}{That's all, thank you.}
{236}{}{就这些，谢谢。}
#{237}{}{I will show you on your map. It was a big city in times that gold ruled these lands. It's lost its glory since then, but people still live there.}
{237}{}{我会在地图上指给你看。在黄金统治这些土地的时代，这是一座大城市。从那以后它失去了它的荣耀，但人们仍然住在那里。}
#{238}{}{You got the coordinates of Salt Lake City.}
{238}{}{你有盐湖城的坐标。}
#{239}{}{That was more than thirty years ago. When the Devourer took his tribute across the world, the old ones hid our people in the mountains. We lived through the Last Day there. Many died afterwards, when huge clouds of burning dust hid us from the Ruler of Life. I don't remember that time very well, as I was very young, but... It was horrible.}
{239}{}{那是三十多年前的事了。当吞食者把他的贡品带到世界各地时，古老的人把我们的人民藏在山里。我们在那里度过了最后一天。许多人死后，当巨大的燃烧的灰尘云掩盖了我们对生命的统治者。我不太记得那个时候，因为我很年轻，但是...太可怕了。}
#{240}{}{The lands themselves stood against us. The mountains made us think of hope, fire and food, but we feared the vicious mutants the most. They attacked settlements and killed everyone. All the remained of people were smashed bodies and torn clothing.}
{240}{}{土地本身与我们作对。群山使我们想到希望、火和食物，但我们最害怕的是邪恶的变种人。他们袭击了定居点，杀死了所有人。剩下的人都是被砸碎的尸体和破衣服。}
#{1130}{}{Stop, wanderer! I am only an old man, and I have nothing. Do not let evil spirits guide you... }
{1130}{}{站住，流浪汉！我只是一个老人，一无所有。别让恶魔指引你...}
#{1143}{}{Hmm... I see a child of the Devourer and at the same time, a person who loves our people. I hope you continue to walk the bright path, wanderer... }
