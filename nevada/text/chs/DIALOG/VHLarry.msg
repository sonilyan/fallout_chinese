#{100}{}{This is Larry Geller.}
{100}{}{我是拉里・盖勒。}
#{101}{}{This is Larry Geller, the leader of the freaks of New Vegas, their moral and spiritual support.}
{101}{}{这是拉里・盖勒，新维加斯怪胎的领袖，他们的道德和精神支柱。}
#{108}{}{ However, I can see from by your face that you also got beaten by a life.}
{108}{}{然而，从你的脸上我可以看出，你也被生活打败了。}
#{109}{}{And here is our smooth-skinned friend... Well, for us, you're still smooth-skinned. But it's a mystery, how they don't shoot you with such a face in the Clean City.}
{109}{}{这是我们皮肤光滑的朋友。。。嗯，对我们来说，你的皮肤还是很光滑的。但这是个谜，他们怎么不在干净的城市里用这样一张脸射你。}
#{110}{}{You'd better not to wander around here. Our hotel is not that much better than the local cemetery. Ha-ha! Joking. The cemetery is way better...}
{110}{}{你最好不要在这里闲逛。我们的旅馆并不比当地的公墓好多少。哈哈！开玩笑。墓地更好。。。}
#{111}{}{Why you walk with bags over your heads? Is that some kind of fashion?}
{111}{}{你为什么头上带着包走路？这是某种时尚吗？}
#{112}{}{Do you contact with your neighbors from "Hard-Rock" cafe?}
{112}{}{你和“硬石”咖啡馆的邻居有联系吗？}
#{113}{}{Do you know anything about the substance called "Emulsifier E30"?}
{113}{}{你知道一种叫“E30乳化剂”的物质吗？}
#{114}{}{I'm looking for a guide for the train trip. Can any of you take the job?}
{114}{}{我在找火车旅行的导游。你们谁能接受这份工作？}
#{115}{}{Oops.}
{115}{}{哎呀。}
#{116}{}{Even if someone would, he wouldn't survive the journey. The health doesn't allow it. Well, unless we drink some of your blood... Ha-ha! Don't worry, I'm joking. We only eat brains...}
{116}{}{即使有人愿意，他也不会在旅途中幸存下来。健康状况不容乐观。除非我们喝了你的血。。。哈哈！别担心，我在开玩笑。我们只吃大脑。。。}
#{117}{}{Very funny. Another question.}
{117}{}{非常有趣。另一个问题。}
#{118}{}{I think I'll go.}
{118}{}{我想我要走了。}
#{119}{}{Emulsifier - some component of a nuclear bomb. A joke. In reality, it's a food supplement. It's some kind of special salt, acid-enriched. It is mined in Salt Lake, in a local lake. Sam Phillips uses an emulsifier to make the pizza dough softer and more tender. His pizza used to be like rubber, you could not cut through it with a knife.}
{119}{}{乳化剂-核弹的某些成分。一个笑话。实际上，这是一种食物补充。是一种特殊的盐，富含酸。它是在盐湖开采的，在当地的一个湖泊里。山姆・菲利普斯用乳化剂使比萨饼面团更柔软、更嫩。他的比萨饼以前像橡皮一样，你不能用刀把它切开。}
#{120}{}{No. But Sam and I used to be very close. He rubbed my back with a crowbar. Ha-ha-ha! Joking. But he is an unbiased person and always accepted us as we are.}
{120}{}{不。但我和萨姆以前很亲近。他用撬棍搓我的背。哈哈哈！开玩笑。但他是一个不偏不倚的人，总是接受我们的本来面目。}
#{121}{}{What can you say about his addiction to drugs? Didn't you ever notice him doing them?}
{121}{}{关于他吸毒成瘾你能说些什么？你没注意到他这么做吗？}
#{122}{}{The city had many problems with drugs. There was a time when Phillips got into the wrong company too. But this is in the past. I'm sure that he is clean and realized his mistakes now.}
{122}{}{这个城市在毒品方面有很多问题。曾经有一段时间，菲利普斯也进错了公司。但这已经是过去了。我确信他现在是清白的，并且意识到了自己的错误。}
#{123}{}{Wait, you've never heard of us? You haven't even been warned that you should avoid us? Looks like you're new in town!}
{123}{}{等等，你从没听说过我们？你还没被警告要避开我们？看来你是新来的！}
#{124}{}{Yes, I am.}
{124}{}{是的，我是。}
#{125}{}{Then know this, they call us "fureecks". We walk with bags over our heads, so you couldn't see us chewing human flesh flesh with our rotten teeth... Ha-ha-ha!!!}
{125}{}{那就知道了，他们叫我们“野猪”。我们头上戴着袋子走路，所以你看不到我们用腐烂的牙齿咀嚼人肉。。。哈哈哈！！！}
#{126}{}{Flesh huh, funny guy. So what is it with your faces?}
{126}{}{嗯，有趣的家伙。你的脸怎么了？}
#{127}{}{With our faces? Oh, wanderer, I can't tell, otherwise you're gonna puke all over the place. Ha-ha!}
{127}{}{用我们的脸？哦，流浪汉，我不知道，否则你会吐得到处都是。哈哈！}
#{128}{}{Stop trying to scare me, mister walking dead. I've seen worse.}
{128}{}{别吓我了，行尸走肉先生。我见过更糟的。}
#{129}{}{What?! You're trying to make fun of me, is that it? We're gonna need another bag - to bury your remains, phreek!}
{129}{}{什么？！你想取笑我，是吗？我们需要另一个袋子-用来埋葬你的遗体，弗雷克！}
#{130}{}{I don't like your jokes. I better go.}
{130}{}{我不喜欢你的笑话。我得走了。}
#{131}{}{Oh! I see, you're tough one. You can call me Larry. Larry Geller - it's my full name.}
{131}{}{哦！我明白了，你是个坚强的人。你可以叫我拉里。拉里・盖勒-这是我的全名。}
#{}{}{}
{}{}{}
#{}{}{}
{}{}{}
#{}{}{}
{}{}{}
#{135}{}{You must be eliminated at once, before others get hurt. Your last words, freek!}
{135}{}{在别人受伤之前，你必须马上被淘汰。你的遗言，弗里克！}
#{136}{}{That's some unhealthy humor. I better go outside for some fresh air.}
{136}{}{那是不健康的幽默。我最好出去透透气。}
#{}{}{}
{}{}{}
#{}{}{}
{}{}{}
#{139}{}{About the tongue - you better not say it. I can take it literally... Ha-ha-ha!!!}
{139}{}{关于舌头-你最好不要说。我可以从字面上理解。。。哈哈哈！！！}
#{140}{}{So what is your sickness?}
{140}{}{你的病是什么？}
#{141}{}{You're very inadequate. It's time to eliminate you!}
{141}{}{你太不称职了。是时候消灭你了！}
#{142}{}{Then I'd better shut up and go away.}
{142}{}{那我最好闭嘴走开。}
#{143}{}{So what are you sick of?}
{143}{}{你讨厌什么？}
#{144}{}{As you wish, Larry. But I will go away now.}
{144}{}{如你所愿，拉里。但我现在要走了。}
#{145}{}{In fact, we haven't suffered from anything in a long time... Except for a small mental disorder.}
{145}{}{事实上，我们已经很长时间没有遭受任何痛苦了。。。除了一个小小的精神障碍。}
#{146}{}{So what is it with your skin then?}
{146}{}{那你的皮肤怎么了？}
#{147}{}{Radiation, friend, radiation. And, apparently, some other shit that flies through the air. The organism ossified, the skin became tough, and the veins lost their elasticity.}
{147}{}{辐射，朋友，辐射。很明显，还有其他一些东西在空中飞来飞去。机体骨化，皮肤变得坚韧，静脉失去弹性。}
#{148}{}{Yeah, I get it. And what now, you hide your faces to not scare any kids or something?}
{148}{}{是的，我明白了。现在呢，你藏起脸来吓唬孩子什么的？}
#{149}{}{In Clean City they frighten the kids with us anyway. Like, look, if you won't behave - then a bad freak will come and carry you to Dead hotel. Sometimes, these oafs talk even worse. They think that we are contagious, so they all stay away from us... Mostly.}
{149}{}{在干净的城市里，他们和我们一起吓唬孩子。比如，听着，如果你不守规矩-那么一个坏怪胎会来把你带到死旅馆。有时候，这些白痴说话更糟。他们认为我们是有传染性的，所以他们都远离我们。。。基本上。}
#{150}{}{What?}
{150}{}{什么？}
#{151}{}{Apparently, someone overdid it and now we are accused of producing drugs. The police even have some circumstantial evidence. I don't know if it's true, but it seems to me, that the police won't look for evidence. They'll just come and shoot us up. I hope that after this our ghosts will haunt them at nights.}
{151}{}{很明显，有人吸毒过量，现在我们被指控生产毒品。警方甚至有一些间接证据。我不知道这是不是真的，但在我看来，警察不会寻找证据。他们会来向我们开枪的。我希望在这之后，我们的鬼魂会在夜晚出没。}
#{152}{}{But you don't produce any drugs, right?}
{152}{}{但你不生产毒品，对吗？}
#{153}{}{The police is right! You need to be moved to a new place you can stay - under 10 feet of dirt!}
{153}{}{警察是对的！你需要搬到一个你能住的新地方-10英尺以下的泥土！}
#{154}{}{Well, this is not my business. Perhaps, I should go.}
{154}{}{好吧，这不关我的事。也许，我该走了。}
#{155}{}{Only medicines from herbs to maintaining our perishable flesh and urination. We have to make powders to expand the venous system. Alas, the police consider this a drug.}
{155}{}{只有草药才能维持我们易腐的肉体和排尿。我们必须制造粉末来扩张静脉系统。唉，警察认为这是毒品。}
#{156}{}{So, are you in death-threatening danger?}
{156}{}{那么，你有死亡威胁吗？}
#{157}{}{I think so too! And now I will fulfill the will of the lady of Justice!}
{157}{}{我也这么认为！现在我要实现正义女神的意志！}
#{158}{}{I do not know who to believe. Perhaps, I'd better just go about my business.}
{158}{}{我不知道该相信谁。也许，我还是继续干我的事吧。}
#{159}{}{If we don't prove our innocence, then the police will come and at best drive us out of the parking lot. And at worst - will take away the medicines and thereby deprive us of the opportunity to piss properly... Ha-ha! Although, we are increasingly arguing - whether they dare to come. Something tells us that they won't.}
{159}{}{如果我们不能证明自己的清白，那么警察就会来，充其量只能把我们赶出停车场。最坏的情况是-会带走药物从而剥夺我们正常撒尿的机会。。。哈哈！不过，我们越来越争论他们是否敢来。有些事告诉我们他们不会的。}
#{160}{}{Can you prove?}
{160}{}{你能证明吗？}
#{161}{}{No. We will never prove our innocence. Especially since we'll soon be hanged for your death as a result of the slow dismemberment... Ha-ha! We wouldn't even be able to bring the evidence to the Clean City - we just will be shot on sight, while walking to the main gate.}
{161}{}{不，我们永远不会证明我们的清白。特别是因为我们很快就会因为你的死而被绞死。。。哈哈！我们甚至不能把证据带到干净的城市――我们只会在走到正门时被一眼射杀。}
#{162}{}{You know, what I think? That justice must prevail! I will try to help you... If you are honest.}
{162}{}{你知道，我怎么想的？正义必须获胜！我会尽力帮助你。。。如果你是诚实的。}
#{163}{}{You don't need to go there! I will shoot you all right here!}
{163}{}{你不需要去那里！我会在这里开枪打死你！}
#{164}{}{Listen, thats your problem, I don't want to have anything to do with it. Thats why I leave.}
{164}{}{听着，那是你的问题，我不想和它有任何关系。这就是我离开的原因。}
#{165}{}{How noble! So much that I don't even believe it. And that's after I threw a poisonous saprophyte mite in your pocket... Do not search your pants. It was a joke!}
{165}{}{多高尚啊！以至于我都不相信。那是在我把一个有毒的腐生螨扔进你口袋之后。。。不要搜你的裤子。开玩笑的！}
#{166}{}{I'm being honest with you. Be honest with me too.}
{166}{}{我对你说实话。对我也要诚实。}
#{167}{}{[Secretly start recording the conversation on your Pip-Boy] I'm being honest with you. Be honest with me too.}
{167}{}{[秘密地开始录下你儿子的对话]我跟你说实话。对我也要诚实。}
#{168}{}{I am also honest... And serious. As much as possible. Yes, we had bad times and once we made powders with much stronger effect. But this is in the past. You must trust us!}
{168}{}{我也很诚实。。。而且很严肃。尽可能多。是的，我们有过不好的时期，有一次我们做了效果更好的粉末。但这已经是过去了。你必须相信我们！}
#{169}{}{Nobody has to do anything for you just yet, comedian. Okay, I trust you. Then who and why would someone go to police on you? And what are the evidence they have there?}
{169}{}{现在还没人为你做任何事，喜剧演员。好吧，我相信你。那谁又为什么会有人报警？他们有什么证据？}
#{170}{}{Not a slightest idea! The evidence is clearly indirect. The chief of police came to us, asked where we get the components, how much dope we make a month... Of course, he did not believe us. I think he is convinced of his rightness and will defend it even if you find evidence of the opposite.}
{170}{}{一点也不知道！证据显然是间接的。警察局长来找我们，问我们从哪儿弄来的零件，一个月赚多少毒品。。。当然，他不相信我们。我认为他确信自己是对的，即使你找到相反的证据，他也会为自己辩护。}
#{171}{}{Well, that isn't much.}
{171}{}{嗯，那不多。}
#{172}{}{I think you should talk to the police first. I think that they will listen to you. Think of a story so as not to cause unnecessary suspicion. And better kill everyone there and bring their hearts as a sacrifice to our god!!! Ha-ha-ha...}
{172}{}{我想你应该先和警察谈谈。我想他们会听你的。想一个故事以免引起不必要的怀疑。最好杀了那里的每一个人，把他们的心作为祭品献给我们的上帝！！！哈哈哈。。。}
#{173}{}{We'll see.}
{173}{}{我们拭目以待。}
#{174}{}{[Secretly start recording the conversation on your Pip-Boy] But you don't produce any drugs, right?}
{174}{}{[秘密地开始录下你儿子的对话]但是你不生产任何毒品，对吗？}
#{175}{}{I found a receipt from the slavers. Here, take a look.}
{175}{}{我找到了奴隶主的收据。来，看看。}
#{176}{}{And do we have to do with it?}
{176}{}{那我们和它有关系吗？}
#{177}{}{I wanted to ask you the same thing - what do you have to do with it, and on who's orders it was all made?}
{177}{}{我想问你同样的问题-你和它有什么关系，是谁下令的？}
#{178}{}{Made?! Well-well-well, let's see. [tries to read]}
{178}{}{制造的？！好吧，让我看看。[试图阅读]}
#{179}{}{Dammit! Larry, you should tell me, you can't read. Let me read it for you.}
{179}{}{该死！拉里，你应该告诉我，你不识字。让我给你读一下。}
#{180}{}{Thank you. But I can read. I just can't see as well as I used to.}
{180}{}{非常感谢。但我能阅读。我只是看不见以前那么好。}
#{181}{}{Enough of excuses. How will you answer to that receipt?}
{181}{}{别再找借口了。你对那张收据怎么回答？}
#{182}{}{I will say that you have a direct proof of our innocence in your hands. Although I don't think that the chief of police will be fully convinced. Unless you put a red-hot poker between his legs... In general, it is necessary that someone smooth-skinned and responsible go to him, or else they won't let us into the Clean City.}
{182}{}{我要说，你手中有我们清白的直接证据。虽然我不认为警察局长会完全信服。除非你在他两腿之间夹一把火红的扑克。。。总的来说，有必要找一个皮肤光滑、有责任心的人来找他，否则他们不会让我们进入干净的城市。}
#{183}{}{Stop! So, what is going on? What is the police have to do with anything?! What the hell have you done?!}
{183}{}{住手！怎么回事？警察跟这有什么关系？！你到底做了什么？！}
#{184}{}{Who could have convince the slavers to do that? Who is your enemy?}
{184}{}{谁能说服奴隶主这么做？你的敌人是谁？}
#{185}{}{We don't have enemies. Most likely, this is just discrimination based on race.}
{185}{}{我们没有敌人。很可能，这只是基于种族的歧视。}
#{186}{}{Hmmm. I doubt it. It seems to me that someone is deliberately trying to drive you out of this parking lot.}
{186}{}{嗯，我怀疑。在我看来，有人故意要把你赶出这个停车场。}
#{187}{}{Well, all right. It's time to go to the police.}
{187}{}{好吧，好吧。该报警了。}
#{188}{}{I don't think that we could harm anyone, since we are sitting quietly and won't even fart in our hotel. In general, we should quickly "please" the police chief. If you know what I mean.}
{188}{}{我认为我们不会伤害任何人，因为我们安静地坐着，甚至不会在酒店放屁。总的来说，我们应该尽快“取悦”警察局长。如果你明白我的意思。}
#{189}{}{Oh, yes, the police. I'll take the evidence there.}
{189}{}{哦，是的，警察。我会把证据带到那里。}
#{190}{}{What?! Why me?! I am also afraid! Here's a flyer, take it yourself.}
{190}{}{什么？！为什么是我？！我也害怕！这是传单，你自己拿吧。}
#{191}{}{Listen! We are not the best inhabitants of the city, we are feared. And we are afraid. But you - you are not. Even the police can't be compared to you! Don't leave us like this! And we will help you in return.}
{191}{}{听！我们不是这个城市最好的居民，我们害怕。我们害怕。但你-你不是。连警察都比不上你！别这样丢下我们！作为回报，我们会帮助你。}
#{192}{}{Okay, okay! I'll take the evidence to the police. I hope they don't shoot me there.}
{192}{}{好吧，好吧！我要把证据交给警察。我希望他们不要在那里开枪打我。}
#{193}{}{You wish! I'm not my own enemy! Here, take the evidence and I'm out of here. My job is done.}
{193}{}{想得美！我不是自己的敌人！拿着证据我就走。我的工作完成了。}
#{194}{}{How will you help me?}
{194}{}{你将如何帮助我？}
#{195}{}{Well. In the end, we should be grateful even for that. Thank you. I think someone in "Hard Rock" will agree to go to the police.}
{195}{}{好。最后，我们应该为此而感激。非常感谢。我想“硬岩”里会有人同意报警的。}
#{196}{}{Great.}
{196}{}{伟大的。}
#{197}{}{And what do I get for all the work?}
{197}{}{我做这些工作能得到什么？}
#{198}{}{We spared your life - is that not enough? Ha-ha-ha! Here. That's all we can give you. [Stretches a pack of stimpaks]}
{198}{}{我们饶了你一命-这还不够吗？哈哈哈！在这里。我们只能给你这么多。[伸展一包史汀帕克]}
#{199}{}{Yeah, thats not much.}
{199}{}{是的，不多。}
#{200}{}{You, wanderer, should be getting in dangerous situation often in the wasteland. May pharmacology help you! Only today - two for the price... Yes for the usual price of course, we all want to eat.}

{206}{}{可以。如你所愿。把证据交给警察就行了。剩下的我们来做。}
#{207}{}{Great. I'm going.}
{207}{}{伟大的。我要走了。}
#{208}{}{It's done! The evidence is delivered, you're now officially innocent.}
{208}{}{完成了！证据出来了，你现在正式无罪了。}
#{209}{}{I came to tell you that you are justified and can sleep peacefully. The police won't come to you again.}
{209}{}{我来告诉你，你是有道理的，可以安睡。警察不会再来找你了。}
#{210}{}{Thank you. We already had one cop coming here. You saved us from exile. You are a good man. Just like us. Nobody here will ever forget this.}
{210}{}{非常感谢。我们已经有一个警察来了。你把我们从流放中救了出来。你是个好人。就像我们一样。这里没有人会忘记这一点。}
#{211}{}{You promised to reward me for my hard work, did you forget that?}
{211}{}{你答应奖励我的努力工作，你忘了吗？}
#{212}{}{"Thank you" will be enough.}
{212}{}{“谢谢”就够了。}
#{213}{}{All in order. Do not abuse it - my advice to you. Or you'll "fly around" like we do. Ha-ha-ha!}
{213}{}{一切正常。不要滥用它-我给你的建议。否则你会像我们一样“到处飞”。哈哈哈！}
#{214}{}{Funny. You would be good in a variety show, Larry.}
{214}{}{好笑。拉里，你在综艺节目中会很出色的。}
#{215}{}{Thank you. We already had one cop with official apologies. Well, as you can see, justice triumphed.}
{215}{}{非常感谢。我们已经有一个警察正式道歉了。嗯，正如你所见，正义胜利了。}
#{216}{}{Right. Take care.}
{216}{}{正确的。当心。}
#{217}{}{I see someone purposely trying to remove you from the hotel.}

#{219}{}{The smooth-skinned wanderer is with us again! How surprising.}

#{220}{}{About the evidence - I can't take it to the police. Look for another way.}
{220}{}{关于证据-我不能报警。另寻出路。}
#{221}{}{What should we do now?}
{221}{}{我们现在该怎么办？}
#{222}{}{We won't be able to find a new place to live.}
{222}{}{我们找不到新地方住了。}
#{223}{}{We are now worse than beggars.}

{226}{}{是时候告别我们的生活了。}
#{227}{}{How did you learn to make that healing powders?}
{227}{}{你是怎么学会做治疗粉的？}
#{228}{}{It's not that complicated. We are masters of survival. If it not for our knowledge of nature, we would die long time ago.}
{228}{}{没那么复杂。我们是生存的主人。如果不是因为我们对自然的了解，我们早就死了。}
#{229}{}{Can you teach me making powder and stimpaks?}
{229}{}{你能教我做粉饼吗？}
#{230}{}{Right.}
{230}{}{正确的。}
#{231}{}{...but no one knows where this knowledge will later be applied. Don't even think about it. Pride and honor are still alive in this dead body.}

{1110}{}{你最好不要在这里闲逛。我们的旅馆并不比当地的公墓好多少。哈哈！开玩笑。墓地更好。。。}
#{1123}{}{Wait, you've never heard of us? You haven't even been warned that you should avoid us? Looks like you're new in town?}
{1123}{}{等等，你从没听说过我们？你还没被警告要避开我们？看起来你是新来的？}
#{1127}{}{With our faces? Oh, wanderer, I can't tell, otherwise you're gonna puke all over the place. Ha-ha!}

{1166}{}{我对你说实话。对我也要诚实。}
#{1167}{}{[Secretly start recording the conversation on your Pip-Boy] I'm being honest with you. Be honest with me too.}
{1167}{}{[秘密地开始录下你儿子的对话]我跟你说实话。对我也要诚实。}
#{1168}{}{I am also honest... And serious. As much as possible. Yes, we had bad times and once we made powders with much stronger effect. But this is in the past. You must trust us!}
{1168}{}{我也很诚实。。。而且很严肃。尽可能多。是的，我们有过不好的时期，有一次我们做了效果更好的粉末。但这已经是过去了。你必须相信我们！}
#{1191}{}{Listen! We are not the best inhabitants of the city, we are feared. And we are afraid. But you - you are not. Even the police can't be compared to you! Don't leave us like this! And we will help you in return.}
{1191}{}{听！我们不是这个城市最好的居民，我们害怕。我们害怕。但你-你不是。连警察都比不上你！别这样丢下我们！作为回报，我们会帮助你。}
#{1193}{}{You wish! I'm not my own enemy! Here, take the evidence and I'm out of here. My job is done.}
{1193}{}{想得美！我不是自己的敌人！拿着证据我就走。我的工作完成了。}

{1200}{}{你这个流浪汉，应该经常在荒地里陷入险境。愿药理学对你有所帮助！只有今天-两个价格。。。是的，通常的价格当然，我们都想吃。}
#{1209}{}{I came to tell you that you are justified and can sleep peacefully. The police won't come to you again.}
{1209}{}{我来告诉你，你是有道理的，可以安睡。警察不会再来找你了。}
#{1210}{}{Thank you. We already had one cop coming here. You saved us from exile. You are a good person. Just like us. Nobody here will ever forget this.}
{1210}{}{非常感谢。我们已经有一个警察来了。你把我们从流放中救了出来。你是个好人。就像我们一样。这里没有人会忘记这一点。}
#{1219}{}{The smooth-skinned wanderer is with us again! How surprising.}
{1219}{}{皮肤光滑的流浪汉又和我们在一起了！真令人惊讶。}
#{1245}{}{Well, that would be an acceptable solution for us, yes. But somehow I doubt that this person will want to have business with us. Would you ask him yourself? We are ready, even starting tomorrow!}
{1245}{}{嗯，那对我们来说是一个可以接受的解决方案，是的。但不知怎的，我怀疑这个人是否愿意和我们做生意。你自己问问他好吗？我们已经准备好了，即使明天开始！}
#{1248}{}{Seriously? Just like that, for "thank you", risking your life? Well, then I just can't let you go empty-handed. Here, take it. [gives 2 packs of some kind of colored pills] It's very good... "memory refresher". He-he. I hope, you know what I mean.}
{1248}{}{说真的？就这样，为了“谢谢”，冒着生命危险？好吧，那我不能让你空手而归。来，拿着。[给了两包彩色药片]非常好……”记忆刷新器”。他，他。希望你明白我的意思。}
