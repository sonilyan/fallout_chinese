#{150}{}{You see Colonel O'Neill (double "l").}
{150}{}{你看到奥尼尔上校了吗。}
#{200}{}{On first sight, he looks like a seasoned warrior.}
{200}{}{乍一看，他像个老练的战士。}
#{250}{}{That's O'Neill, Colonel. He looks bored.}
{250}{}{那是奥尼尔，上校。他看起来很无聊。}
#{300}{}{Ah, my knee hurts again. What do you think, will it rain?}
{300}{}{啊，我的膝盖又疼了。你觉得会下雨吗？}
#{301}{}{According to my navigation calculations, we are in the middle of the wasteland. More or less.}
{301}{}{根据我的航行计算，我们在荒地的中央。或多或少。}
#{302}{}{Maybe I should stay in retirement. I'm too old for this.}
{302}{}{也许我该退休了。我年纪太大了。}
#{303}{}{Teal'c, when we all get back - will you go fishing with me?}
{303}{}{蒂尔克，等我们都回来了-你愿意和我一起去钓鱼吗？}
#{304}{}{I love these desert planets SO MUCH!}
{304}{}{我太喜欢这些沙漠星球了！}
#{305}{}{Huh! I will never get used to this!}
{305}{}{呵呵！我永远不会习惯的！}
#{500}{}{Hello there!}
{500}{}{你好！}
#{501}{}{Eh... Hi.}
{501}{}{呃。。。你好。}
#{502}{}{Hello. Who are you?}
{502}{}{你好。你是谁？}
#{503}{}{Hey! Have we already met?}
{503}{}{嘿！我们已经见过面了吗？}
#{504}{}{Hey! Have we already met?}

#{550}{}{I am Jack O'Neill, SG-1. How do they call you?}
{550}{}{我是杰克・奥尼尔，SG-1。他们怎么称呼你？}
#{551}{}{Ergh... Calling... You...}
{551}{}{呃。。。打电话。。。你。。。}

{600}{}{我叫杰克・奥尼尔-双“l”。你呢？}
#{601}{}{I am }
{601}{}{我是}
#{602}{}{. What are you doing here, O'Neill?}
{602}{}{. 你在这里干什么，奥尼尔？}
#{603}{}{No, I don't think you need to know that. And besides, I've got a lot of work. I cannot stay here and chitchat with you.}
{603}{}{不，我不认为你需要知道。而且，我还有很多工作要做。我不能呆在这里和你闲聊。}
#{650}{}{Yeah? Do you know me?}
{650}{}{是 啊？你认识我吗？}
#{651}{}{Of course, you're that repairman, that... MacGyver!}
{651}{}{当然，你就是那个修理工，那个。。。麦基弗！}
#{652}{}{No, I actually mistook you for a guy from a washing machine commercial.}
{652}{}{不，我把你错当成洗衣机广告里的人了。}
#{653}{}{No, I actually mistook you for a guy from a washing machine commercial.}
{653}{}{不，我把你错当成洗衣机广告里的人了。}
#{700}{}{Come on, dammit, loosen up a little and let's rock! Yeah, so what's your name?}
{700}{}{来吧，该死的，放松一点，让我们摇滚！是的，那你叫什么名字？}
#{701}{}{Ergh... Grunt... diddy biddy.}
{701}{}{呃。。。咕噜。。。迪迪・比迪。}
#{750}{}{Well... I sunbathe and I get paid for it. In fact, I'm an explorer.}
{750}{}{好。。。我晒日光浴，我得到报酬。事实上，我是个探险家。}
#{751}{}{An explorer, yeah? That may be interesting. Where are you from?}
{751}{}{探险家，是吗？那可能很有趣。你从哪里来的？}
#{752}{}{Wow, that's really a cool occupation, isn't it! You get to see weird stuff, meet new people...}
{752}{}{哇，那真是个很酷的职业，不是吗！你可以看到奇怪的东西，认识新朋友。。。}
#{800}{}{No, you are mistaken. I am Jack O'Neill, from S G One.}
{800}{}{不，你错了。我是杰克・奥尼尔，来自S G One。}
#{801}{}{What, O'Neal?}
{801}{}{什么，奥尼尔？}
#{802}{}{Nice to meet you, Jack. They call me }
{802}{}{很高兴见到你，杰克。他们叫我}
#{803}{}{. What are doing in these parts?}
{803}{}{. 你在这些地方干什么？}
#{804}{}{S G One? What's that?}
{804}{}{G一号？那是什么？}
#{850}{}{I'm really famous. In the past, I appeared in an underwear commercial. But then I joined the army and have been an explorer ever since. Sometimes I kill someone, sometimes someone kills me, you know the drill...}
{850}{}{我真的很有名。在过去，我出现在内衣广告。但后来我参军了，从那以后我一直是个探险家。有时我杀了人，有时有人杀了我，你知道的。。。}
#{851}{}{Your job is killing? That must be awesome!}
{851}{}{你的工作是杀人？那一定很棒！}
#{852}{}{Yeah, That's what life is about nowadays.}
{852}{}{是啊，这就是现在的生活。}
#{900}{}{See how well you are doing! And what can you tell me next? Come on, give it a try!}
{900}{}{看看你做得多好！接下来你能告诉我什么？来吧，试试看！}
#{901}{}{Oink burp beep beep.}
{901}{}{咕噜咕噜咕噜。}
#{902}{}{Hi hi, next, next...}
{902}{}{嗨，下一个，下一个。。。}
#{903}{}{He he, little fishyyy...}
{903}{}{呵呵，小鱼。。。}
#{950}{}{Yeah, it is interesting most of the time, just like now. Instead of transporting to a foreign planet we travelled to the future. You see, I come from the past, from the year 2000. But it's good to have a little excitement, because most of the time the missions turn out to be boring and tedious.}
{950}{}{是啊，大部分时间都很有趣，就像现在一样。我们去了未来，而不是去一个陌生的星球。你看，我来自过去，来自2000年。不过，有点兴奋也不错，因为大多数时候任务都很枯燥乏味。}
#{951}{}{Year 2000? That's quite a long time ago. In those times, people even thought that digital watches were a good idea.}
{951}{}{2000年？那是很久以前的事了。在那个时代，人们甚至认为数字手表是个好主意。}
#{952}{}{Well, explorer, there are a lot of things to explore here. I bet that you won't feel like a fish out of water here!}
{952}{}{探险家，这里有很多东西要探索。我敢打赌你在这里不会觉得自己像一条离开水的鱼！}
#{953}{}{Better dead than bored, that's my tune.}
{953}{}{宁可死也不要无聊，这是我的调子。}
#{1000}{}{If you think that it's awesome, then you're either a lunatic or you have never killed anybody.}
{1000}{}{如果你觉得这太棒了，那你要么是个疯子要么你从没杀过人。}
#{1001}{}{If you think that it's awesome, then you're either a lunatic or you have never killed anybody.}
{1001}{}{如果你觉得这太棒了，那你要么是个疯子要么你从没杀过人。}
#{1002}{}{With a gun like yours, killing must be a joy. And yes, I'm a lunatic and killing is the meaning of my life!}
{1002}{}{有你这样的枪，杀人一定是件乐事。是的，我是个疯子，杀人是我生命的意义！}
#{1003}{}{What the hell are you on about? I don't know what's so bad about killing?!}
{1003}{}{你到底在说什么？我不知道杀人有什么不好？！}
#{1050}{}{No. O'Neill, double "l"! Colonel. Look, sort out the names!}
{1050}{}{不，奥尼尔，双“l”！上校。看，把名字整理出来！}
#{1051}{}{I'm sorry. Didn't your picture appear in Fishing yearbook?}
{1051}{}{我很抱歉。你的照片没有出现在钓鱼年鉴上吗？}
#{1052}{}{Yes, sorry, but I suffer from an advanced stage of invert schizophrenia caused by post-traumatic shock stemming from prenatal embryogenesis.}
{1052}{}{是的，对不起，但我患有晚期倒置性精神分裂症，这是由于产前胚胎发育引起的创伤后休克所致。}
#{1053}{}{I don't care. You'd better tell me something more about that G-spot one.}
{1053}{}{我不在乎。你最好多告诉我一些关于G点的事。}
#{1100}{}{Well, you remind me of Daniel after two beers. You know what? Go sleep it off!}
{1100}{}{你让我想起喝了两杯啤酒的丹尼尔。你知道吗？去睡吧！}
#{1101}{}{Hi hi. Grunt!}
{1101}{}{嗨。咕噜！}
#{1150}{}{SG-1 is an elite commando of the SGC unit, USAF. We travel by stargate - it's that big "O" behind me - to other planets and there we help people to fulfill their American dream.}
{1150}{}{SG-1是美国空军SGC部队的精锐突击队。我们乘坐星际之门――我身后的那个大“O”号――前往其他星球，在那里我们帮助人们实现他们的美国梦。}
#{1151}{}{You are from the army? So you might know what caused the holes that are everywhere around us.}
{1151}{}{你是军人？所以你可能知道是什么导致了我们周围到处都是洞。}
#{1152}{}{To other planets? By stargate? Now you'll tell me that little gray men named a starship after you! You're crazy, O'Neill. Goodbye.}
{1152}{}{去其他星球？在星门附近？现在你告诉我小灰人用你的名字命名了一艘星际飞船！你疯了，奥尼尔。再见。}
#{1153}{}{That sure is a very praiseworthy and interesting activity.}
{1153}{}{这的确是一个值得称赞和有趣的活动。}
#{1200}{}{I'm sorry, I cannot read anything from holes in the ground. But Carter and her widgets may figure something out.}
{1200}{}{对不起，我从地上的洞里看不到任何东西。但卡特和她的小部件可能会想出一些办法。}
#{1201}{}{Look, tell me something about your team.}
{1201}{}{听着，告诉我一些关于你们队的事。}
#{1202}{}{What's your world like, soldier?}
{1202}{}{你的世界是什么样子的，士兵？}
#{1203}{}{What's this gun of yours, actually?}
{1203}{}{你的枪是什么？}
#{1204}{}{Thanks then. I'd rather go.}
{1204}{}{那就谢谢你了。我宁愿去。}
#{1250}{}{Great. I just hope that you don't have kids.}
{1250}{}{伟大的。我只希望你没有孩子。}
#{1251}{}{Noo kids, thank ya, noo hungry now. Grunt grunt.}
{1251}{}{孩子们，谢谢，现在不饿了。咕噜咕噜。}
#{1252}{}{[Try to eat his shoe.]}
{1252}{}{[试着吃掉他的鞋子。]}
#{1300}{}{A fish... Fish! What do you know about fish! Speak, are there any fish around here?!}
{1300}{}{一条鱼。。。鱼！你对鱼了解多少！说吧，这附近有鱼吗？！}
#{1301}{}{Fish be here. [Hand out O'Neill a bent tin box of sardines that you found just now.]}
{1301}{}{鱼在这里。[把你刚才找到的一盒沙丁鱼递给奥尼尔。]}
#{1302}{}{Fish be here. [Hand out O'Neill a bent tin box of sardines that you found just now.]}
{1302}{}{鱼在这里。[把你刚才找到的一盒沙丁鱼递给奥尼尔。]}
#{1303}{}{Sure. If you'll walk that way, you'll reach the sea in a while and there you can fish to your heart's content. It's just a 1,500 mile walk through the nuclear wasteland.}
{1303}{}{当然。如果你走那条路，一会儿就能到海边，在那里你可以尽情钓鱼。穿过核荒地只有1500英里。}
#{1304}{}{Fish? Maybe in the sea - if something survived in that radioactive goo.}
{1304}{}{鱼？也许在海里-如果有什么东西在放射性粘液中幸存下来。}
#{1305}{}{Of course there are! A week ago I found a lake in the wasteland and went fishing there like a king. I caught a three-eyed fish this big! [Show him the measurements of an average sized anaconda.]}
{1305}{}{当然有！一周前，我在荒地里发现了一个湖，像个国王一样去那里钓鱼。我钓到一条这么大的三眼鱼！[给他看一条平均大小的水蟒的尺寸。]}
#{1306}{}{Of course there are! A week ago I found a lake in the wasteland and went fishing there like a king. I caught a three-eyed fish this big! [Show him the measurements of an average sized anaconda.]}
{1306}{}{当然有！一周前，我在荒地里发现了一个湖，像个国王一样去那里钓鱼。我钓到一条这么大的三眼鱼！[给他看一条平均大小的水蟒的尺寸。]}
#{1350}{}{Hm... And are they not? Wait, what year is it again?}
{1350}{}{嗯。。。不是吗？等等，又是哪一年？}
#{1351}{}{Well, you'll have to find out yourself, explorer. Maybe the craters around us will tell you the answer.}
{1351}{}{好吧，探险家，你得自己找找看。也许我们周围的陨石坑会告诉你答案。}
#{1352}{}{Approximately the year 100 of the new era. As in, 100 years from Armageddon.}
{1352}{}{大约是新纪元的100年。就像世界末日100年前一样。}
#{1400}{}{Well, when I was killed last time, I wished to be bored instead. Boredom can be cured, death not so much. And the best cure is fishing.}
{1400}{}{好吧，上次我被杀的时候，我倒是希望无聊。无聊是可以治愈的，死亡不是那么多。最好的治疗方法是钓鱼。}
#{1401}{}{You like fishing? Me too!}
{1401}{}{你喜欢钓鱼吗？我也是！}
#{1402}{}{I don't find fishing interesting at all. Better tell me something about the era that you come from.}
{1402}{}{我觉得钓鱼一点也不有趣。最好告诉我一些你所处的时代。}
#{1450}{}{Goodbye, buddy, and good luck!}
{1450}{}{再见，伙计，祝你好运！}
#{1451}{}{Goodbye, lady, and good luck!}
{1451}{}{再见，女士，祝你好运！}
#{1452}{}{Bye.}
{1452}{}{再见。}
#{1500}{}{Eh... you know, I will pretend that I understood. And you have to promise me that you'll never do that again, OK?}
{1500}{}{呃。。。你知道，我会假装我明白。你必须向我保证你再也不会那样做了，好吗？}
#{1501}{}{OK, OK. Tell me more about the SG-1.}
{1501}{}{好的，好的。告诉我更多关于SG-1的事。}
#{1502}{}{Do you mean using expressives in communication process?}
{1502}{}{你的意思是在交际过程中使用表达法吗？}
#{1550}{}{Yeah, if it wasn't complicated, it wouldn't be called life.}
{1550}{}{是啊，如果不复杂的话，就不会叫生活。}
#{1551}{}{Wow, that was deep!}
{1551}{}{哇，太深了！}
#{1552}{}{Man, are you a philosopher?}
{1552}{}{伙计，你是哲学家吗？}
#{1650}{}{I assume he won't tell me, will he? I'll try to ask Carter, maybe her widgets found something out.}
{1650}{}{我想他不会告诉我吧？我去问问卡特，也许她发现了什么。}
#{1651}{}{Whatever.}
{1651}{}{无论什么。}
#{1700}{}{That's... Ehm, I'm sorry.}
{1700}{}{那是。。。嗯，对不起。}
#{1701}{}{Heh.}
{1701}{}{嘿。}
#{1750}{}{I don't get it. Why is everything around here radioactive?}
{1750}{}{我不明白。为什么这里的一切都有放射性？}
#{1751}{}{Well, you're sure asking the right person! I barely remember my own name. Anyway, as far as I know, a war happened here. Nuclear war.}
{1751}{}{好吧，你问对人了！我几乎不记得自己的名字了。无论如何，据我所知，这里发生了一场战争。核战争。}
#{1752}{}{Well, you're sure asking the right person! I barely remember my own name. Anyway, as far as I know, a war happened here. Nuclear war.}
{1752}{}{好吧，你问对人了！我几乎不记得自己的名字了。无论如何，据我所知，这里发生了一场战争。核战争。}
#{1753}{}{God only knows, buddy.}
{1753}{}{天知道，伙计。}
#{1800}{}{Yeah? And what do you prefer? Bottom fishing or fly fishing?}
{1800}{}{是 啊？你更喜欢什么？海底捞还是飞钓？}
#{1801}{}{Most of the times I use hand grenades.}
{1801}{}{大多数时候我都用手榴弹。}
#{1802}{}{Well, given the absence of trout waters in this radioactive wasteland I can fish only by live lining.}
{1802}{}{好吧，考虑到这片放射性荒地没有鳟鱼水，我只能靠活鱼线捕鱼。}
#{1803}{}{Sometimes, when I feel like it, I travel high in the mountains, find myself some nice trout stream and I fish by trolling for about a week.}
{1803}{}{有时，当我想去的时候，我会在高山上旅行，给自己找一些很好的鳟鱼小溪，然后用鱼钩钓上一个星期。}
#{1804}{}{I fish to feed myself, using a spear or a club.}
{1804}{}{我用矛或棍子钓鱼来养活自己。}
#{1805}{}{I fish to feed myself, using a spear or a club.}
{1805}{}{我用矛或棍子钓鱼来养活自己。}
#{1850}{}{Since the Armageddon? Yeah, when I look around, it looks like after the end of the world here.}
{1850}{}{从世界末日开始？是的，当我环顾四周时，这里就像是世界末日之后。}
#{1851}{}{Tell me about your world, O'Neill.}
{1851}{}{告诉我你的世界，奥尼尔。}
#{1852}{}{Look, Colonel, what's that gun of yours? You don't see a gun like that very often.}
{1852}{}{上校，你的枪是什么？你很少看到这样的枪。}
#{1853}{}{It was nice talking to you, O'Neill, but I've got to go. Goodbye.}
{1853}{}{很高兴和你谈话，奥尼尔，但我得走了。再见。}
#{1900}{}{Our world is... It's nice. Not exactly perfect, but it's nice. Fish are biting, baseball is doing well... The people are living happily. But still, a couple of tough guys like myself must stand guard with a gun in the hand, so the rest of the people could kiss their children goodnight and sleep in peace. We are doing OK so far, but the Goa'ulds are still a threat.}
{1900}{}{我们的世界是。。。很好。不是很完美，但是很好。鱼在咬人，棒球打得很好。。。人民生活得很幸福。不过，像我这样的几个硬汉必须持枪站岗，这样其他人就可以亲吻他们的孩子晚安，安然入睡了。到目前为止，我们做得还不错，但果阿的ULD仍然是一个威胁。}
#{1901}{}{You fish, O'Neill? I also like to fish from time to time.}
{1901}{}{你在钓鱼吗，奥尼尔？我也时常喜欢钓鱼。}
#{1902}{}{Life is much tougher nowadays.}
{1902}{}{现在的生活要艰难得多。}
#{2050}{}{Oh my God! You mean to tell me that those crazies started it, in the end?! Those killers! Damn them all to hell! Eh... Sorry, I got carried away.}
{2050}{}{哦，我的上帝！你的意思是说是那些疯子干的？！那些凶手！把他们都下地狱！呃。。。对不起，我被迷住了。}
#{2051}{}{Yeah. They detonated possibly all the nuclear bombs in the world and threw us back to the stone age.}
{2051}{}{是 啊。他们可能引爆了世界上所有的核弹，把我们带回了石器时代。}
#{2052}{}{Yeah, those treacherous communist swine attacked us. However, our heroic guys were prepared and retaliated!}
{2052}{}{是啊，那些奸诈的共产主义猪袭击了我们。然而，我们的英雄们已经做好了准备，并进行了报复！}
#{2150}{}{Ah, you barbarian! What did the fish do to you, that you kill them like that? It is desecrating the fishing! Oh God!}
{2150}{}{啊，你这个野蛮人！鱼对你做了什么，你就这样杀了它们？这是对钓鱼的亵渎！哦，上帝！}
#{2151}{}{Well well, don't get mad. I fish to survive. Literally. The fish of today would bite off your head like nothing.}
{2151}{}{好吧，别生气。我捕鱼是为了生存。真的。今天的鱼会把你的头咬下来。}
#{2152}{}{Well well, don't get mad. I fish to survive. Literally. The fish of today would bite off your head like nothing.}
{2152}{}{好吧，别生气。我捕鱼是为了生存。真的。今天的鱼会把你的头咬下来。}
#{2153}{}{So what, do you have a problem with it?! If I'd feel like it, I would gladly use electricity.}
{2153}{}{那又怎样，你有什么问题吗？！如果我愿意，我很乐意用电。}
#{2200}{}{Trolling and fly fishing are a little too active for my taste. There is a lot of action during missions, so during vacation I prefer to sit down and do some bottom fishing. Of course, when I was younger, I practiced live lining a lot. What kind of glitters do you use?}
{2200}{}{拖钓和飞钓对我来说有点太活跃了。任务期间有很多活动，所以在假期我更喜欢坐下来做一些海底捞。当然，当我年轻的时候，我经常练习现场排练。你用什么样的闪光粉？}
#{2201}{}{I practice live lining as well, if I find rich waters. Unfortunately, most of the rivers and lakes are dead. Trolling in a mountain stream promises a quick catch, but I'm not very keen on fly fishing - I always entangle myself in the line. Cut and straightened cartridges are the best thing to use as a glitter. Fish are crazy for .223 Remington!}
{2201}{}{如果我发现了丰富的水域，我也会练习活衬里。不幸的是，大部分的河流和湖泊都死了。在山涧里拖钓可以很快钓到鱼，但我不太喜欢飞钓――我总是把自己困在钓线上。切割和拉直墨盒是最好的东西作为闪光使用。鱼是疯狂的。223雷明顿！}
#{2202}{}{For the clear waters, safety pins from grenades, smoke-stained in fire, are the best. In dirtier waters, the Nuka-Cola caps. As hooks I use modified piercing from robbers and raiders I killed.}
{2202}{}{对于清澈的水域，手榴弹上的安全别针、火焰中的烟雾是最好的。在更脏的水域，努卡可乐的瓶盖。作为钩子，我用我杀死的强盗和袭击者改良的刺穿法。}
#{2250}{}{Let me give you a little advice. Take a flexible rod, about five feet long, and fasten a loop on it every two inches, and thread a fifteen feet of very thin string through it, preferably made out of nylon. Fasten one end of the string to the handle, and put some fishing device to the other end - ideally some hook, similar to the little anchor. That's how you got a fishing rod. Put a worm on a hook, and cast it to water - and then just wait, quietly. If you do it in some calm water full of life, I'm sure you will catch a nice stack of fish. It will easily provide you with food and you won't hurt yourself or other animals.}
{2250}{}{让我给你一点建议。拿一根大约五英尺长的柔性杆，每隔两英寸在上面系一个环，然后用一根十五英尺长的细绳穿过，最好是尼龙做的。把绳子的一端固定在把手上，另一端放一些打捞装置――最好是一些钩子，类似于小锚。你就是这样弄到鱼竿的。把虫子放在钩子上，扔到水里，然后静静地等着。如果你在充满生机的平静的水中做，我相信你会钓到一堆好鱼。它很容易给你提供食物，你不会伤害自己或其他动物。}
#{2251}{}{Is it so? I have to try it right now then!}
{2251}{}{是这样吗？那我现在就得试试！}
#{2252}{}{Well... actually... actually yes! Damn, yeah you're right! I don't understand a word you say, but it sounds like a cool invention! Thank you, O'Neill!}
{2252}{}{好。。。事实上。。。实际上是的！该死，你说得对！你说的话我一个字都听不懂，但听起来像是个很酷的发明！谢谢你，奥尼尔！}
#{2253}{}{No, I think that my way of fishing is better. Shooting into the water never fails. Goodbye.}
{2253}{}{不，我认为我的钓鱼方式更好。射入水中从未失败。再见。}
#{2300}{}{This is Pee-Ninety. Horizontal magazine for fifty bullets in bullpup stock made out of durable plastics. Long barrel and dynamic breech block can fire 900 Teflon coated bullets per minute. Flashlight, telescopic, laser and infra red scope included. Here, hold this little gun in your arms!}
{2300}{}{这是尿床。用耐用塑料制成的水平弹匣，装五十发子弹。长枪管和动态炮尾挡每分钟可发射900发特氟隆涂层子弹。手电筒，望远镜，激光和红外线范围包括在内。来，把这把小枪抱在怀里！}

{2301}{}{它漂亮，轻便，方便用户使用。。。你真幸运，奥尼尔！}
#{2302}{}{That smooth body... These graceful curves... This light trigger... Breech block located so far back... This is the gun of my dreams!}
{2302}{}{光滑的身体。。。这些优美的曲线。。。这个光触发器。。。后备箱就在后面。。。这是我梦想中的枪！}
#{2303}{}{It's nice, but there are other weapons that I like more.}
{2303}{}{很好，但我更喜欢其他武器。}
#{2450}{}{That's terrible! When I'll come back to my times, I will try to prevent it! Like the danger of a Goa'uld attack wasn't enough, those lunatics even fight against each other! They destroyed our beautiful Earth like this... Oh God...}
{2450}{}{太可怕了！当我回到我的时代，我会努力阻止它！就像果阿乌尔德袭击的危险还不够，那些疯子甚至还互相争斗！他们这样摧毁了我们美丽的地球。。。哦上帝。。。}
#{2451}{}{Goodbye then, O'Neill. I am leaving for the wasteland, and hopefully I'll survive.}
{2451}{}{再见，奥尼尔。我要去荒地了，希望我能活下来。}
#{2452}{}{And I have to live in this wasteland. A gun like yours would make a lot of things easier.}
{2452}{}{我不得不住在这片荒地上。像你这样的枪会让很多事情变得简单。}
#{2500}{}{Christ, patriotism is a good thing, but this is horrible! Inexcusable!}
{2500}{}{天哪，爱国主义是好事，但这太可怕了！不可原谅！}
#{2501}{}{I pray to God, daily, to send one of those red devils in my way. So I can exact revenge. If I had a gun like yours, I could do that much better.}
{2501}{}{我每天向上帝祈祷，派一个红魔来挡我的路。所以我可以报仇。如果我有你这样的枪，我可以做得更好。}
#{2502}{}{I pray to God, daily, to send one of those red devils in my way. So I can exact revenge. If I had a gun like yours, I could do that much better.}
{2502}{}{我每天向上帝祈祷，派一个红魔来挡我的路。所以我可以报仇。如果我有你这样的枪，我可以做得更好。}
#{2503}{}{What's inexcusable about killing commies?}
{2503}{}{杀害共产主义者有什么不可原谅的？}
#{2550}{}{So this is the way you feel? I don't want to deal with you any more, then. Go back where you came from!}
{2550}{}{这就是你的感觉？我不想再和你打交道了。回到你原来的地方去！}
#{2551}{}{So this is the way you feel? I don't want to deal with you any more, then. Go back where you came from!}
{2551}{}{这就是你的感觉？我不想再和你打交道了。回到你原来的地方去！}
#{2552}{}{Goodbye, O'Neill!}

{2702}{}{我也是。但是一把好枪总是能派上用场，任何一把好枪。}

{2900}{}{有什么不好？一切！人的生命太宝贵了，不能就这样浪费！}
#{2901}{}{That's bullshit. I kill quite often and it's worth it!}

{2953}{}{也许在过去。在这种时候，你必须先开枪，然后再问问题。再见，奥尼尔，我们看看谁能活到周末。}
#{3000}{}{I can make it even deeper. But now I'd rather talk about something other than philosophy.}

#{3004}{}{I'm going to go.}

#{3050}{}{No, I'm a soldier. But if you don't want to become just a killing machine, you have to think. Do you want to know something else?}
{3050}{}{不，我是军人。但如果你不想成为杀人机器，你必须思考。你还想知道别的吗？}
