#{100}{}{You see recruits' mentor.}
{100}{}{你会看到新兵的导师。}
#{101}{}{You see Edward Benson, the mentor of recruits for "Nevada Express".}
{101}{}{你可以看到爱德华・本森，《内华达快车》的新兵导师。}
#{102}{}{I'm busy right now, please don't waste my time.}
{102}{}{我现在很忙，请不要浪费我的时间。}
#{103}{}{This was the right decision, thanks. Now, back to work... }
{103}{}{这是正确的决定，谢谢。现在，回去工作。。。}
#{110}{}{I'm doing paperwork. If this isn't about business, then please don't distract me.}
{110}{}{我在做文书工作。如果这不是生意上的事，那请不要分散我的注意力。}
#{111}{}{What is it? Can't you see I'm trying to work?}
{111}{}{它是什么？你没看到我在努力工作吗？}
#{112}{}{Alright, I'm going.}
{112}{}{好吧，我要走了。}
#{113}{}{Fine, I won't bother you.}
{113}{}{好吧，我不会打扰你的。}
#{114}{}{We'll talk later.}
{114}{}{我们稍后再谈。}
#{116}{}{Well, if the boss said so... Yeah, that happened. [he takes on a very formal look] We were sent to investigate a distress signal. Halfway there, we meet the survivors. If not for us, they'd have been goners. If they'd kept going, they'd have run straight into the Cheyennes.}
{116}{}{如果老板这么说。。。是的，确实如此。我们被派去调查一个求救信号。半路上，我们遇到了幸存者。如果不是我们，他们早就死了。如果他们继续前进，他们就会直接冲进夏延群岛。}
#{117}{}{What, again? Sh... Long story short - we were sent to investigate a distress signal and halfway there we picked up two of the survivors. After that, we returned to New Reno.}
{117}{}{什么，再说一遍？嘘。。。长话短说――我们被派去调查一个求救信号，在那里走到一半时，我们救起了两名幸存者。之后，我们回到了新雷诺。}
#{118}{}{Who were the survivors?}
{118}{}{幸存者是谁？}
#{119}{}{Did you investigate the attack site?}
{119}{}{你调查过袭击地点吗？}
#{120}{}{What do you know about the attack?}
{120}{}{你对这次袭击了解多少？}
#{121}{}{Can you give me the coordinates for the attack site?}
{121}{}{你能告诉我攻击地点的坐标吗？}
#{130}{}{Two of our guards. Good boys. Showed themselves quite well in previous missions. Excellent shooters with steel nerves - just what we need. I think they passed by recently, headed off towards the restaurant.}
{130}{}{我们的两个警卫。好孩子。在以前的任务中表现得很好。有钢铁般的神经的优秀射手-正是我们需要的。我想他们最近路过，朝餐馆走去。}
#{131}{}{Err... We didn't. It was still a long way to go and the survivors told us everything we needed to know.}
{131}{}{呃。。。我们没有。还有很长的路要走，幸存者告诉了我们需要知道的一切。}
#{132}{}{Our boys said that the attack was carried out by bikers. I trust them. Nobody else would have the firepower or balls to crack our convoy.}
{132}{}{我们的人说袭击是骑自行车的人干的。我信任他们。没有人会有火力或胆量来摧毁我们的车队。}
#{133}{}{Eh? What?! Maybe you'd like me to bend over for you as well?}
{133}{}{嗯？什么？！也许你也希望我为你鞠躬？}
#{134}{}{But Tuco said I could!}
{134}{}{但图科说我可以！}
#{135}{}{Knock it off, Tuco gave the go-ahead.}
{135}{}{别说了，图科同意了。}
#{136}{}{[Mockingly] "But Tuco said I could!"... Of course, he's the boss. Here are the coordinates. More than likely, the stagecoach was looted by Black Rock locals. Won't even wish you luck with that. Hah!}
{136}{}{“但图科说我可以”。。。当然，他是老板。这是坐标。更有可能的是，驿站马车被黑岩当地人洗劫一空。我甚至不会祝你好运。哈哈！}
#{137}{}{[He mutters something inaudible to himself] ...of course, he's the boss. Here are the coordinates. More than likely, the stagecoach was looted by Black Rock locals. Won't even wish you luck with that. Hah!}
{137}{}{[他喃喃自语]当然，他是老板。这是坐标。更有可能的是，驿站马车被黑岩当地人洗劫一空。我甚至不会祝你好运。哈哈！}
#{138}{}{Tuco said you led the rescue operation on the stagecoach?}
{138}{}{图科说是你领导了驿站马车的营救行动？}
#{139}{}{Tell me about the rescue operation again.}
{139}{}{再告诉我一次营救行动。}
#{140}{}{Who are you?}
{140}{}{你是谁？}
#{141}{}{Did you hear anything about the bikers around here?}
{141}{}{你听说过这附近骑自行车的人吗？}
#{142}{}{[Grumbling] This city has too many rude assholes these days... I'm Edward. I'm the "Nevada Express" recruits mentor.}
{142}{}{这个城市现在有太多粗鲁的混蛋。。。我是爱德华。我是“内华达快车”的新兵导师。}
#{143}{}{Bikers? I *hate* them! They're a plague on Nevada! Goddamn troglodytes, covered in jangles and other crap, thinking they can stir up bars and hit our stagecoaches. Those sons of bitches should stay as far away from me as possible!}
{143}{}{摩托车手？我讨厌他们！他们是内华达州的瘟疫！该死的troglodytes，浑身是叮当声和其他垃圾，以为他们能搅动酒吧，撞上我们的舞台马车。那些狗娘养的应该离我越远越好！}
#{150}{}{Now, sit down and look at this. I want to see your face as you see the data here.}
{150}{}{现在，坐下来看看这个。我想看看你的脸，就像你看到这里的数据一样。}
#{151}{}{[Studies the data-disk] What the... Hold on... No! Everything is gone!}
{151}{}{[研究数据盘]什么。。。等等。。。不！一切都不见了！}
#{152}{}{What are you talking about?}
{152}{}{你在说什么？}
#{153}{}{I'm talking about how this evidence needs to rust along with the rest of the stagecoach.}
{153}{}{我说的是这些证据要和其他马车一起生锈。}
#{154}{}{Looks like you know more than you let out, right?}
{154}{}{看来你知道的比你说的还多，对吧？}
#{155}{}{There are forces bigger than us. I'll explain.}
{155}{}{有比我们更强大的力量。我会解释的。}
#{156}{}{I don't want explanations. Just profit.}
{156}{}{我不需要解释。只是利润。}
#{157}{}{Of course, I'd like to know what made you do that.}
{157}{}{当然，我想知道是什么让你这么做的。}
#{158}{}{Personal interest? It could end with a bullet from a dark alley if you don't listen to my words.}
{158}{}{个人兴趣？如果你不听我的话，最后可能会有一颗子弹从黑暗的巷子里射出来。}
#{159}{}{Alright, I'm listening.}
{159}{}{好吧，我在听。}
#{160}{}{Some businessman went into Salt Lake, to sort out Nuka-Cola sales in Reno, and was on his way back. Another guy in Reno wanted to prevent this deal, and it just so happened, that two of our guards owed him money.}
{160}{}{一个商人走进盐湖城，去理清努卡可乐在里诺的销售情况，然后就回来了。里诺的另一个人想阻止这笔交易，碰巧我们的两个警卫欠他钱。}
#{161}{}{And you knew?}
{161}{}{你知道吗？}
#{162}{}{No, I found out later. The guys told me everything eventually. When I learned the truth, I had to go along with it. After all, we can't change the past and we don't need problems with the local mob.}
{162}{}{不，我后来才知道。他们最终把一切都告诉了我。当我知道真相时，我不得不接受。毕竟，我们不能改变过去，我们也不需要与当地暴民发生冲突。}
#{163}{}{As you can see, the plan didn't work.}
{163}{}{如你所见，这个计划行不通。}
#{164}{}{Hold on! Whatever happened, please understand - the "Nevada Express" has nothing to do with this. The blame can be laid on those two, but if Tuco or anyone outside the company finds out that there are criminals in our ranks? Our reputation would take a huge hit. It would be bad for everyone. Should we really risk so much just for the truth's sake?}
{164}{}{坚持住！不管发生了什么，请理解，“内华达快车”与此无关。可以把责任推到这两个人身上，但如果图科或公司以外的任何人发现我们的队伍里有罪犯呢？我们的声誉将受到巨大打击。这对每个人都不好。我们真的应该为了真相冒这么大的风险吗？}
#{165}{}{Do you have any ideas?}
{165}{}{你有什么想法吗？}
#{166}{}{Perhaps... I could just destroy the chip. The guards would've done the same.}
{166}{}{也许。。。我可以毁掉芯片。警卫也会这么做的。}
#{167}{}{But your actions damaged the biker's reputation. If you continue sending heat their way, the might starting raiding the "Nevada Express" for real.}
{167}{}{但你的行为损害了摩托车手的声誉。如果你继续向他们发送热量，他们可能真的开始袭击“内华达快车”。}
#{168}{}{Shit, I didn't think of that... What are we going to do then?}
{168}{}{妈的，我没想到。。。那我们该怎么办？}
#{169}{}{I'll try and think something up. Not now.}
{169}{}{我会想办法的。不是现在。}
#{170}{}{Fine, I'll just destroy the evidence.}
{170}{}{好吧，我就销毁证据。}
#{171}{}{Fine, I'll just destroy the evidence. But I demand a reward - $2000.}
{171}{}{好吧，我就销毁证据。但我要的是2000美元。}
#{172}{}{Your ideas are shit. I'll find another use for the chip.}
{172}{}{你的想法真糟糕。我会找到芯片的另一个用途。}
#{173}{}{I *really* hope you will.}
{173}{}{我真的希望你会。}
#{174}{}{Goodbye.}
{174}{}{再见。}
#{175}{}{I didn't expect your conscience to get in the way. Thank you. I hope we won't return to this question again. And here, something for your troubles.}
{175}{}{我没想到你的良心会妨碍我。非常感谢。我希望我们不要再讨论这个问题了。在这里，给你的麻烦。}
#{176}{}{Bye.}
{176}{}{再见。}
#{177}{}{Is that the price of your silence? Hmm... Well, I think it would be safer than risking the company's reputation. Here's the money, but I don't think I'll be happy to see you again.}
{177}{}{这就是你沉默的代价吗？隐马尔可夫模型。。。我觉得比冒公司声誉的风险更安全。这是钱，但我想我不会再高兴见到你了。}
#{178}{}{Bye.}
{178}{}{再见。}
#{179}{}{It's not too late to reconsider!}
{179}{}{现在重新考虑还不晚！}
#{180}{}{See you.}
{180}{}{再见。}
#{181}{}{I have an idea. I'll reprogram the disk and give it to Tuco. Everyone will think that the attack was carried out by some raider gang.}
{181}{}{我有个主意。我会重新编程，把它交给图科。每个人都会认为这次袭击是某个袭击团伙所为。}
#{182}{}{Genius! And you think you can do that?}
{182}{}{天才！你觉得你能做到吗？}
#{183}{}{Of course, I have plenty of knowledge about programming robots.}
{183}{}{当然，我对机器人编程有很多知识。}
#{184}{}{Pfft, how hard could it be? It's just ones and zeroes, right?}
{184}{}{Pfft，这有多难？只有1和0，对吗？}
#{185}{}{Uhh... Maybe we shouldn't risk it. If anyone finds evidence that the disk was tampered with, then the whole plan will be for nothing.}
{185}{}{呃。。。也许我们不该冒险。如果有人发现磁盘被篡改的证据，那么整个计划将一无所获。}
#{186}{}{Then I'm gonna think about it a little more.}
{186}{}{那我再考虑一下。}
#{187}{}{All that's left is to do it then, eh?}
{187}{}{剩下的就是做了，嗯？}
#{188}{}{Let's do it!}
{188}{}{我们开始吧！}
#{189}{}{I have other things to do. I'll be back when I'm ready.}
{189}{}{我还有别的事要做。我准备好了就回来。}
#{190}{}{[You finished writing and compiling the code before testing it a few times. It works like a charm!] Zzzzzz... Huh? Wha-? It's done? Oh, let's see... Perfect! We'll tell Tuco that we mistakenly identified the attackers as bikers. He'll be angry for a bit, but after we make an apology, the bikers themselves should calm down. Thank you, I won't forget it.}
{190}{}{[在测试代码几次之前，您已经完成了代码的编写和编译。它就像一个魔咒！]Zzzzzz。。。呵呵？什么-？完成了吗？哦，让我看看。。。很 完美！我们会告诉图科我们把袭击者误认为是摩托车手。他会有点生气，但在我们道歉之后，骑自行车的人自己应该冷静下来。谢谢，我不会忘记的。}
#{191}{}{Anytime.}
{191}{}{随时都可以。}
#{1189}{}{I have other things to do. I'll be back when I'm ready.}
{1189}{}{我还有别的事要做。我准备好了就回来。}
