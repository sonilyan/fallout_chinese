#{100}{}{You see a farmer.}
{100}{}{你看到一个农夫。}
#{101}{}{You see a tanned resident of Bridgeport. Obviously, he spends the whole day watching brahmin.}
{101}{}{你看到布里奇波特的一个晒黑的居民。显然，他整天都在看婆罗门。}
#{102}{}{}
{102}{}{}
#{103}{}{You should leave this town as fast as you can.}
{103}{}{你应该尽快离开这个城市。}
#{104}{}{Thanks for the help.}
{104}{}{谢谢你的帮助。}
#{105}{}{Oh no, not this! How we'll survive without brahmin?!}
{105}{}{哦不，不是这个！没有婆罗门我们怎么活下去？！}
#{106}{}{Well...}
{106}{}{好。。。}
#{110}{}{Hey. What do you want?}
{110}{}{嘿。你想要什么？}
#{111}{}{Tell me about the bikers.}
{111}{}{告诉我关于摩托车手的事。}
#{112}{}{I will help gather the herd into the pen.}
{112}{}{我将帮助把羊群聚集到围栏里。}
#{113}{}{So, you watch brahmin here?}
{113}{}{你在这里看婆罗门？}
#{114}{}{Tell me about this settlement.}
{114}{}{告诉我这个定居点的情况。}
#{115}{}{Bye.}
{115}{}{再见。}
#{116}{}{Hey, you17re not one of these bikers right? If not, then get out of here as soon as possible! These friggin' bikers have made so much noise here, that my poor brahmin fled around the city. Now I can't drive them back to the corral...}
{116}{}{嘿，你不是那种摩托车手吧？如果没有，那就尽快离开这里！这些该死的摩托车手在这里制造了如此多的噪音，以至于我可怜的婆罗门在城里四处逃窜。现在我不能把他们赶回畜栏。。。}
#{117}{}{Are you still here? Better go away before these bikers begin to brawl.}
{117}{}{你还在吗？最好在这些摩托车手开始打架之前离开。}
#{118}{}{Ah, it17s so peaceful without the bikers... That17s how our little rural town should be. Wait, do you need something?}
{118}{}{啊，没有骑自行车的人太安静了。。。这就是我们这个乡村小镇应该是什么样子。等等，你需要什么吗？}
#{119}{}{Thanks for the help with the brahmin. If not for you I would have to chase them myself. They are unpredictable when scared.}
{119}{}{谢谢你对婆罗门的帮助。如果不是你，我就得自己去追他们。他们害怕的时候是不可预测的。}
#{120}{}{They came here from the north. At first one, then another - and now so many came, as if they planned this. I don't know what they have forgotten in our small settlement, but we don't want to ask. I hope they leave soon, they only make trouble.}
{120}{}{他们是从北方来的。起初是一个，然后是另一个――现在来了这么多人，好像是他们计划的。我不知道他们在我们的小定居点忘了什么，但我们不想问。我希望他们快点离开，他们只会制造麻烦。}
#{121}{}{You can help? That's great. Remember - they are very stubborn when frightened, which will make it difficult to catch them.}
{121}{}{你能帮忙吗？太好了。记住――它们在受到惊吓时非常固执，这会使它们很难被抓住。}
#{122}{}{Yes, pretty much I do look after brahmin. But we have very few people, that17s why everyone sometimes has to do a little of everything.}
{122}{}{是的，我确实很照顾婆罗门。但是我们的人很少，这就是为什么每个人有时都要做一些事情。}
#{123}{}{Our lovely Bridgeport. When our families moved here from the clutches of war in Reno, there was no one here. Only the old dilapidated houses covered with sand and dirt. We worked long and hard to turn this place into a something more-or-less fit to live.}
{123}{}{我们可爱的布里奇波特。当我们的家人从雷诺战争的魔爪中搬过来时，这里一个人也没有。只有满是沙子和泥土的破旧房屋。我们花了很长时间和精力把这个地方变成一个或多或少适合居住的地方。}
#{124}{}{You're welcome.}
{124}{}{不客气。}
