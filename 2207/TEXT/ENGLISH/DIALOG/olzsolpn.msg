{3}{}{You see a power network console.}
{4}{}{Looks like the power supply of the whole level is controlled from here.}

{5}{}{You see a safe.}
{6}{}{This container has a tough lock with a numeric key entry. Looks like it hasn't been used for a long time.}

{120}{}{This old photon converter is breaking down completely. It has become impossible to repair it. Its performance dropped below 35%, which is enough to constantly power only the Systematizer and Control Hall. He is more likely to drop me out to the wasteland than risk his safety. I'm compelled to install the last spare photon converter, but how long would it last, or what will happen to the tower when it breaks down... I don't want to even think about it...}

{130}{}{I've tried many different ways of dealing with it, but he still hears me! Even if he tries to not show it... The tower is stuffed with all kinds of surveillance devices, so he is observing everything like he is some kind of God! But I can't give up... If he managed to get there, then there must be a way to get him out, to remove him. In the end, the salvation of this tower is my responsibility only...}

{140}{}{I'm not quite sure, but looks like the access codes to different levels are changing dynamically... Like someone just makes data streams to reroute their flow! I suspect that I could find answers to most of my questions on the Server level, but ordinary mortals like me don't have access to it... And I will never be accepted into the ranks of Defenders with my health... GODDAMN CODED KEYCARDS!}

#Node015
{150}{}{This tower... It is enormous! Even with abandoned levels and blocked stairs, it's a huge, almost living mechanism, filled with loads of cameras, sensors, and automated doors. Also, you need to observe the population, turrets, department cooperation, and a lot of other things. No, the human can't do that. At least one human alone... I think he somehow plugged himself into the Systematizer and uses it to control all this tech. At least that's what I would try to do, if I were him.}
