### {400}{}{Trust? I don't even know. A piece of advice, kid - trust no one. If you learn a secret - keep it to yourself, be healthy. Radius doesn't like blabbers, it chews them down and spits them out because when you gave out the information, it has no need for you anymore. Listen and be silent. You'll live long enough.}
{400}{}{相信我甚至不知道。一条建议，孩子，不要相信任何人。如果你学会了一个秘密――保密，保持健康。Radius不喜欢胡言乱语，它会把它们咬下来吐出来，因为当你发布信息时，它就不再需要你了。倾听并保持沉默。你会活得足够长的。}

### {410}{}{Hah, there are no kids here! Except for that little snot, Martha's offspring. I think her name is Lily. She was recently bit by a scorpion, everyone went crazy about it. That damn girl is only slowing us down. Instead of dealing with her, everyone could get together and storm the Tartarus already.}
{410}{}{哈，这里没有孩子！除了那个小鼻涕，玛莎的后代。我想她的名字叫莉莉。她最近被一只蝎子咬了，大家都为之疯狂。那个该死的女孩只会让我们慢下来。与其对付她，每个人都可以聚在一起，袭击鞑靼人。}
