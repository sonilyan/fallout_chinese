#{100}{}{You see David.}
{100}{}{你看到大卫了。}
#{101}{}{You see, one of the bouncers of the casino.}
{101}{}{你看，赌场的一个保镖。}
#{110}{}{Look, I'm  watching for someone here, and you better not interfere.}
{110}{}{听着，我在找人，你最好别插手。}
#{111}{}{Who are you watching for?}
{111}{}{你在看谁？}
#{112}{}{What if I find this guy before you?}
{112}{}{如果我比你先找到这个人呢？}
#{113}{}{Okay, I will not bother you.}
{113}{}{好吧，我不会打扰你的。}
#{114}{}{Rude! I will complain of your administration!}
{114}{}{粗鲁无礼！我要抱怨你的管理！}
#{115}{}{For unscrupulous visitors of the casino. Now, leave me.}
{115}{}{为了赌场的不择手段的游客。现在，离开我。}
#{116}{}{Hmm. Actually, it's not a bad idea. You see, one of our customers has debt of a really big sum of money, and now he hides from justice.}
{116}{}{嗯。实际上，这个主意不错。你看，我们的一个客户欠了一大笔债，现在他躲着不受审判。}
#{117}{}{What's the name of this client?}
{117}{}{这个客户叫什么名字？}
#{118}{}{How much does he owe the casino?}
{118}{}{他欠赌场多少钱？}
#{119}{}{Why don't you chase him, but instead hanging around in the lobby?}
{119}{}{你为什么不追他，而是在大厅里闲逛？}
#{120}{}{What'll be for me if I bring him to you?}
{120}{}{如果我带他来见你，对我有什么好处？}
#{121}{}{You know, sort it out without me.}
{121}{}{你知道，不用我来处理。}
#{122}{}{That??s enough! I want to buy off the debt of this guy!}
{122}{}{够了！我要收买这家伙的债！}
#{130}{}{His name is Norman.}
{130}{}{他叫诺曼。}
#{131}{}{Oh, it's a reeeally big debt. What he owed to us costs on the market around approximately 3000 bucks. Pretty good, considering he wouldn??t want to part with this... Item, while he is still breathing.}
{131}{}{哦，这真是一笔很大的债务。他欠我们的钱在市场上大约要3000美元。很好，考虑到他不想放弃这个...当他还在呼吸的时候。}
#{132}{}{What do you think I am doing? I??m looking for this son of a bitch, Mr. Snoops! Yes, right here. Because the only exit is here, and to run looking for him in the crowd, down and up of all the floors, is quite exhausting.}
{132}{}{你以为我在干什么？我在找这个狗娘养的，史努普斯先生！是的，就在这里。因为唯一的出口就在这里，在人群中跑来跑去寻找他，在所有楼层上下，是相当累人的。}
#{133}{}{Well, the honor of the administrative sector of the casino and, perhaps, 500$ from me for the capture. I'm still going to make a lot more money off him than this pitiful amount.}
{133}{}{好吧，赌场行政部门的荣誉，也许还有我500美元的抓捕费。我还是要从他身上赚到比这个可怜的数目多得多的钱。}
#{134}{}{Oh, I would be very happy. Because I don't have to dirty my hands and then wait for a suitable customer on his glan.... Uh, never mind. But it is 3000 bucks - that??s the price of his dept.}
{134}{}{哦，我会很高兴的。因为我不必弄脏我的手，然后等待一个合适的客户在他的龟头...。呃，没关系。但这是3000美元-这是他的部门的价格。}
#{135}{}{I have the desired amount. Let's make the exchange.}
{135}{}{我有想要的数量。我们来交换吧。}
#{136}{}{Great! Enjoy a good deal. Here's our receipt. He can now walk out of the casino, do not worry. I keep my word.}
{136}{}{太好了！好好享受吧。这是我们的收据。他现在可以走出赌场了，别担心。我信守诺言。}
#{137}{}{Ok, I??ll tell him.}
{137}{}{好吧，我告诉他。}
#{150}{}{The one you looking for is dead.}
{150}{}{你要找的那个已经死了。}
#{151}{}{Is that so? First, let??s check if it's true...}
{151}{}{是这样吗？首先，让我们看看这是不是真的...}
#{152}{}{Sure.}
{152}{}{当然。}
#{153}{}{Great! Less of a hassle. Of course, the casino is not accustomed to encourage the use of force to resolve issues, but in this case I speak as a private person, so here's 300 bucks as a tip. Thank you, wanderer.}
{153}{}{太好了！少了点麻烦。当然，赌场不习惯鼓励使用武力来解决问题，但在这种情况下，我以私人身份发言，所以这里有300美元作为小费。谢谢你，流浪者。}
#{154}{}{No, thank *you*!}
{154}{}{不，谢谢你！}
#{155}{}{...uh, yeah, and one more thing. I heard that our boss, Hal Wallace, is looking for someone for a certain work. I think you should talk to him if you need a job.}
{155}{}{……嗯，是的，还有一件事。我听说我们的老板哈尔・华莱士正在找一个能胜任某项工作的人。如果你需要工作，我想你应该和他谈谈。}
#{156}{}{Great! Bye!}
{156}{}{太好了！再见！}
#{1132}{}{What do you think I am doing? I??m looking for this son of a bitch, Mrs. Snoops! Yes, right here. Because the only exit is here, and to run looking for him in the crowd, down and up of all the floors, is quite exhausting.}
