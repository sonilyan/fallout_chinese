### {102}{}{Oh, of course, please.}
{102}{}{哦，当然可以。}
### {103}{}{It's good to see you.}
{103}{}{很高兴见到你。}

### {110}{}{Hey, are we here yet?}
{110}{}{嘿，我们到了吗？}
### {111}{}{A big city. Almost a Hub. Eh, brings back memories...}
{111}{}{一个大城市。几乎是一个枢纽。呃，让人回想起。。。}
### {112}{}{This city is like a prison. I wonder if the locals are happy?}
{112}{}{这座城市就像一座监狱。我想知道当地人是否高兴？}
### {113}{}{The city of nomadic cattle breeders. That's so unexpected.}
{113}{}{游牧养牛者的城市。这太出乎意料了。}
### {114}{}{This place gives me the creeps.}
{114}{}{这个地方让我毛骨悚然。}
### {115}{}{I don't like this place. Be careful.}
{115}{}{我不喜欢这个地方。小心。}
### {116}{}{Is this your home village? Your diligence is admirable.}
{116}{}{这是你的家乡吗？你的勤奋令人钦佩。}
### {117}{}{I can't believe my eyes. These are the legendary Desert Rangers!}
{117}{}{我简直不敢相信自己的眼睛。这些是传说中的沙漠游侠！}
### {118}{}{Don't you think we've gone too far south?}
{118}{}{你不觉得我们向南走得太远了吗？}
### {119}{}{Finally we got out of this hell.}
{119}{}{我们终于走出了地狱。}
### {120}{}{Hmm. It seems the locals don't like outsiders.}
{120}{}{嗯。看来当地人不喜欢外来者。}

#The first dialog
### {200}{}{Thank God there is someone else with a human face here!}
{200}{}{感谢上帝，这里还有一个长着人脸的人！}
### {201}{}{Who are you?}
{201}{}{你是谁？}
### {202}{}{Diane. I am a Follower of the Apocalypse and am on my way to the settlement of Casa Nueva. But my convoy was attacked by rippers. I was captured and brought here. I don't even know if anyone else from my group survived.}
{202}{}{黛安娜。我是启示录的追随者，正在前往努瓦之家定居的路上。但我的车队遭到了海盗的袭击。我被抓了回来。我甚至不知道我的团队中是否还有其他人幸存下来。}
### {203}{}{I'm really sorry, Diana.}
{203}{}{我真的很抱歉，黛安娜。}
### {204}{}{Clear.}
{204}{}{清楚的}
### {205}{}{And what are you doing here? Were you captured by the rippers too?}
{205}{}{你在这里干什么？你也被盗贼抓走了吗？}
### {206}{}{Actually, I'm here by accident. The inhabitants of my village were taken away by slavers, and I'm looking for them.}
{206}{}{事实上，我来这里是偶然的。我所在村庄的居民被奴隶贩子带走了，我正在寻找他们。}
### {207}{}{Hmm. I've heard that the slave trade is developing in the east. But I don't think you'll find anyone here except mutants.}
{207}{}{嗯。我听说东部的奴隶贸易正在发展。但我认为除了变种人你不会在这里找到任何人。}
### {208}{}{So are you going to run away from here?}
{208}{}{你打算从这里逃跑吗？}
### {209}{}{It doesn't matter. Are you going to run away from here?}
{209}{}{没关系。你打算逃离这里吗？}
### {210}{}{The Brotherhood of Steel sent me to help.}
{210}{}{钢铁兄弟会派我来帮忙。}
### {211}{}{Yes, the Brotherhood never abandons its brothers and sisters. You can't blame them for that.}
{211}{}{是的，兄弟会从不抛弃兄弟姐妹。你不能因此责怪他们。}
### {212}{}{So you're going to run away from here?}
{212}{}{所以你要逃离这里？}
### {213}{}{I'm afraid it won't be easy to get out of here. If we try to leave the cathedral, the guards will grab us. But even if we are outside, we will be torn apart by the rippers.}
{213}{}{恐怕要离开这里并不容易。如果我们试图离开大教堂，警卫会抓住我们。但即使我们在外面，我们也会被撕裂者撕裂。}
### {214}{}{We need to be smarter here.}
{214}{}{我们需要在这里变得更聪明。}
### {215}{}{Exactly. I don't want bloodshed. And Levi, it seems, too. He promised to let us go if I helped him with his research.}
{215}{}{确切地我不想流血。李维似乎也是。他答应如果我帮他做研究就让我们走。}
### {216}{}{Is there any way to fight them off?}
{216}{}{有办法击退他们吗？}
### {217}{}{I'm not a fan of bloodshed. Levi promised to let us go if I helped him with his research. But if you really crave battle, then you can't do without power armor here.}
{217}{}{我不喜欢流血。李维答应，如果我帮他做研究，他会放我们走的。但如果你真的渴望战斗，那么你就离不开这里的力量盔甲。}
### {218}{}{I need to assess the situation and think.}
{218}{}{我需要评估形势并进行思考。}
### {219}{}{}
{219}{}{error : string is empty}
### {220}{}{Sure. But don't leave me. The children of Casa Nueva are waiting for my biology lessons.}
{220}{}{当然但不要离开我。努瓦之家的孩子们正在等我上生物课。}
### {221}{}{Okay...}
{221}{}{可以}

#Repeat dialog
### {250}{}{So what? What's your plan?}
{250}{}{那又怎样？你的计划是什么？}
### {251}{}{Wait for my instructions.}
{251}{}{等待我的指示。}
### {252}{}{What does Levi say?}
{252}{}{李维说什么？}

### {260}{}{Tell me what's going on here.}
{260}{}{告诉我这里发生了什么事。}
### {261}{}{OK. What exactly do you want to know?}
{261}{}{好的。你到底想知道什么？}
### {262}{}{Perhaps that's all.}
{262}{}{也许仅此而已。}

#- about your mission
### {270}{}{I'm interested in your mission.}
{270}{}{我对你的任务感兴趣。}
### {271}{}{I was going to Casa Nueva. This settlement needs scientists and teachers. Several Followers are already doing some research there.}
{271}{}{我本来打算去努瓦之家。这个定居点需要科学家和教师。一些追随者已经在那里做了一些研究。}
### {272}{}{Perhaps that's all.}
{272}{}{也许仅此而已。}
### {273}{}{Can you show me where it is?}
{273}{}{你能告诉我它在哪里吗？}
### {274}{}{Sure. Open your card, I'll show you...}
{274}{}{当然打开你的卡片，我给你看。。。}
### {275}{}{Thank you.}
{275}{}{非常感谢。}
### {276}{}{I happened to visit this city. Nice place.}
{276}{}{我碰巧参观了这个城市。好地方。}
### {277}{}{Really? Great. The faster I want to get there.}
{277}{}{真正地太棒了我想越快到达那里。}
### {278}{}{We'll come back to that later... If we get out of here.}
{278}{}{我们稍后再谈。。。如果我们离开这里。}
### {279}{}{Casa Nueva was built by slaves, and peons work on the plantations there. Scientists are parasitic on someone else's work.}
{279}{}{努瓦之家是由奴隶建造的，人们在那里的种植园里工作。科学家们寄生在别人的工作上。}
### {280}{}{Yes, it is difficult to combine science and manual labor. And, of course, it is wrong to oppress someone. But we strive to make the world a better place. Besides, slaves were not used by us, but by the mercenaries of the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{280}{}{是的，科学和体力劳动很难结合起来。当然，压迫别人是不对的。但我们努力让世界变得更美好。此外，奴隶不是我们使用的，而是钢铁兄弟会的雇佣兵使用的。}
### {281}{}{Okay, that sounds convincing.}
{281}{}{好吧，听起来很有说服力。}
### {282}{}{Yeah, like that changes anything.}
{282}{}{是的，就像这改变了一切一样。}

### {290}{}{Who are these Followers of the Apocalypse?}
{290}{}{这些启示录的追随者是谁？}
### {291}{}{Well, we are something like a charitable foundation. We teach people to read and write, treat diseases and enlighten them with pre-war knowledge.}
{291}{}{我们有点像慈善基金会。我们教人们读写，治疗疾病，并用战前的知识启迪他们。}
### {292}{}{So you want to bring back the Old World?}
{292}{}{所以你想带回旧世界？}
### {293}{}{Not quite. They say history repeats itself, but it doesn't copy itself at every turn. In other words, the Old World cannot be returned as it was. Yes, it is not necessary.}
{293}{}{不完全是。他们说历史在重演，但它并不是每次都在复制自己。换言之，旧世界无法恢复原状。是的，没有必要。}
### {294}{}{Ugh, I thought you were crazy.}
{294}{}{啊，我还以为你疯了。}
### {295}{}{I see.}
{295}{}{我明白了。}
### {296}{}{You're crazy! The old World fell because of this very knowledge.}
{296}{}{你疯了！旧世界正是因为这种知识而衰落的。}
### {297}{}{I do not think so. It's not about knowledge, it's about using it. We make sure that no one repeats the mistakes of the Old World.}
{297}{}{我不这么认为。这与知识无关，而是使用知识。我们要确保没有人重蹈旧世界的覆辙。}
### {298}{}{Well, well. As if you can keep track of everyone.}
{298}{}{嗯，嗯。就好像你可以跟踪每个人一样。}
### {299}{}{Your goals are noble and pure. I hope others understand them the same way.}
{299}{}{你的目标是高尚而纯粹的。我希望其他人也能理解他们。}
### {300}{}{How did you get ambushed?}
{300}{}{你是怎么被伏击的？}
### {301}{}{We were attacked by rippers. They set up an ambush, created a dust curtain and pulled me out of the group. I was rescued by Levi's men, who happened to be nearby, and then brought here.}
{301}{}{我们遭到了暴徒的袭击。他们设置了一个伏击，制造了一个防尘幕，把我从队伍中拉了出来。我被李维斯的人救了出来，他们正好在附近，然后被带到了这里。}
### {302}{}{And you're still thanking him for that?}
{302}{}{你还在为此感谢他吗？}
### {303}{}{I don't believe these people are bad at heart. Levi is just following the path that seems right to him. And besides, he has to do it.}
{303}{}{我不相信这些人心地不好。李维只是在走他认为正确的道路。此外，他必须这么做。}
### {304}{}{What about your companions?}
{304}{}{你的同伴呢？}
### {305}{}{So the Rippers were acting on Levi's orders?}
{305}{}{所以开膛手是按照李维斯的命令行事的？}
### {306}{}{Probably, yes. Levi is a kind of god for them... or the devil. They try to please him and follow simple orders. But these are just my guesses.}
{306}{}{可能吧，是的。李维对他们来说是一种神。。。或者魔鬼。他们试图取悦他，听从简单的命令。但这些只是我的猜测。}
### {307}{}{And what happened to your companions?}
{307}{}{你的同伴怎么了？}
### {308}{}{The squad consisted of several members of the Brotherhood of Steel. The squad was led by Paladin Barkley. After I was kidnapped, I didn't hear anything about them. I don't know if they're alive or dead.}
{308}{}{这个小队由钢铁兄弟会的几个成员组成。这支队伍由圣骑士巴克利率领。在我被绑架后，我没有听到任何关于他们的消息。我不知道他们是活着还是死了。}
### {309}{}{Clear.}
{309}{}{清楚的}

### {310}{}{You mentioned the Brotherhood of Steel. Tell me about him.}
{310}{}{你提到了钢铁兄弟会。告诉我关于他的事。}
### {311}{}{Well, it's a closed military organization in California. The Followers have strained relations with them, so I was taken into the convoy with great dissatisfaction.}
{311}{}{这是加州一个封闭的军事组织。追随者与他们关系紧张，所以我带着极大的不满被带进了车队。}
### {312}{}{What are they doing?}
{312}{}{他们在干什么？}
### {313}{}{Mostly nothing. But lately the Brotherhood is clearly lacking energy. They started buying up all the nuclear batteries in the region. They are also the best specialists in energy weapons and high pre-war technologies. But they keep almost all of this for themselves and do not want to share it with the outside world.}
{313}{}{基本上什么都没有。但最近穆兄会显然缺乏活力。他们开始购买该地区所有的核电池。他们也是能源武器和战前高科技领域的最佳专家。但他们几乎把这一切都留给了自己，不想与外界分享。}
### {314}{}{I see. Enough about this Brotherhood.}
{314}{}{我明白了。这个兄弟会够了。}
### {315}{}{Then what are they doing in Arizona?}
{315}{}{那他们在亚利桑那州干什么？}
### {316}{}{I think they are also collecting technologies and energy sources. There are many untouched pre-war sites left in Arizona.}
{316}{}{我认为他们也在收集技术和能源。亚利桑那州有许多未被破坏的战前遗址。}
### {317}{}{Do you know where their base is?}
{317}{}{你知道他们的基地在哪里吗？}
### {318}{}{Their only outpost is on an old warship in Puerto Penasco, on the Gulf coast of California.}
{318}{}{他们唯一的前哨基地是在加利福尼亚州墨西哥湾沿岸佩纳斯科港的一艘旧军舰上。}
### {319}{}{What are they doing in Arizona?}
{319}{}{他们在亚利桑那州做什么？}
### {320}{}{Thank you. That's what I needed.}
{320}{}{非常感谢。这正是我所需要的。}

# about this city
### {330}{}{What do you know about this city?}
{330}{}{你对这个城市了解多少？}
### {331}{}{Before the War it was called Mexicali. A large border town. The Reds destroyed it when they bombed numerous local factories.}
{331}{}{战前它被称为墨西卡利。一个边境小镇。红军轰炸了许多当地工厂，摧毁了它。}
### {332}{}{Okay, whatever.}
{332}{}{好吧，不管怎样。}
### {333}{}{About these rippers. Who are they?}
{333}{}{关于这些撕裂者。他们是谁？}
### {334}{}{These are Mexicali residents who survived the nuclear bombing in 2077. The souls of those who were once human. I am immensely sorry for these poor people. For them, the ruins have become an eternal hell.}
{334}{}{这些是在2077年的核爆炸中幸存下来的墨西卡利居民。那些曾经是人类的灵魂。我为这些穷人感到非常抱歉。对他们来说，废墟已成为永恒的地狱。}
### {335}{}{I see. Let's not talk about the sad.}
{335}{}{我明白了。让我们不要谈论悲伤。}
### {336}{}{Why do they build totems out of bones?}
{336}{}{他们为什么用骨头做图腾？}
### {337}{}{The Rippers gather in a kind of animal pack. Each group has its own territory assigned to it, and totems are a kind of label.}
{337}{}{开膛手们聚集在一个动物群里。每个群体都有自己的领地，图腾是一种标签。}
### {338}{}{I see. Enough about the rippers.}
{338}{}{我明白了。关于撕裂者已经够多了。}
### {339}{}{Do they have weaknesses? I need to know where to aim if I run into them again.}
{339}{}{他们有弱点吗？如果我再次遇到他们，我需要知道该瞄准哪里。}
### {340}{}{Well, they are pretty fast, tenacious and often gather in a pack. It will be better to keep a long distance from them. And against the crowd, weapons of mass destruction have always been the most effective. But don't forget that they were once people too.}
{340}{}{嗯，它们速度很快，很顽强，经常聚在一起。与他们保持长距离会更好。大规模杀伤性武器一直是最有效的武器。但别忘了，他们也曾经是人。}
### {341}{}{Don't worry, these are notes in case of an ambush.}
{341}{}{别担心，这些都是笔记，以备不时之需。}
### {342}{}{Are you protecting these animals? You're stupid, Diana.}
{342}{}{你在保护这些动物吗？你真傻，黛安娜。}
### {343}{}{I wonder why they need bone totems?}
{343}{}{我想知道他们为什么需要骨图腾？}
### {344}{}{They are almost a hundred years old?! How so?}
{344}{}{他们都快一百岁了？！为什么呢}
### {345}{}{Are you saying they're almost a hundred years old?}
{345}{}{你是说它们差不多有一百年的历史了吗？}
### {346}{}{It's an old story. Do you want to hear it in its entirety?}
{346}{}{这是一个古老的故事。你想听完整的吗？}
### {347}{}{No. I'm just wondering who they are.}
{347}{}{不，我只是想知道他们是谁。}
### {348}{}{Yes. Let it be just a story, but I want to know.}
{348}{}{对让它只是一个故事，但我想知道。}
### {349}{}{Not far from here there was a laboratory where experiments were carried out with a very dangerous virus. A nuclear explosion damaged the complex, as a result, the virus broke free and flew around half the world.}
{349}{}{离这里不远的地方有一个实验室，在那里用一种非常危险的病毒进行了实验。一次核爆炸破坏了这座建筑群，结果病毒挣脱了束缚，飞遍了半个世界。}
### {350}{}{Go on.}
{350}{}{继续}
### {351}{}{This city was quickly covered by a poisonous cloud. The virus combined with radiation had a strange effect, giving the inhabitants immortality. However, I don't think they are happy about it. And by the way, not only ghouls were the result of mutation, but also all the wild animals in the area.}
{351}{}{这座城市很快就被一片毒云覆盖了。这种病毒与辐射相结合产生了一种奇怪的效果，使居民长生不老。然而，我认为他们对此并不高兴。顺便说一句，不仅食尸鬼是突变的结果，该地区的所有野生动物也是如此。}
### {352}{}{What kind of virus was it?}
{352}{}{它是什么样的病毒？}
### {353}{}{The Virus Of Man-Made Evolution. Secret military development. Already in our time, the Creator used VRE to create an army of super mutants. Levi's people are the result of these inhuman experiments.}
{353}{}{人类进化的病毒。秘密军事发展。早在我们的时代，造物主就使用VRE创造了一支超级变种人大军。李维斯的人是这些非人实验的结果。}
### {354}{}{Judging by his squad, the virus had many side effects.}
{354}{}{根据他的团队判断，这种病毒有很多副作用。}
### {355}{}{The creator conducted many experiments and got different results. Many died before he came to balance. But even his best mutants have to periodically take some substances to stabilize the mutagen. In addition, many mutants have their own unique features. In general, everything is very complicated.}
{355}{}{创作者进行了许多实验，得到了不同的结果。许多人在他恢复平衡之前就去世了。但即使是他最好的突变体也必须定期服用一些物质来稳定诱变剂。此外，许多突变体都有自己独特的特点。总的来说，一切都很复杂。}
### {356}{}{I see. Thanks for the story.}
{356}{}{我明白了。谢谢你的故事。}

### {360}{}{About the power armor.}
{360}{}{关于力量盔甲。}
### {361}{}{She was being taken to a military base in Puerto Penasco. When the rippers attacked the convoy, no one had time to use this miracle of pre-war technology.}
{361}{}{她被带到佩纳斯科港的一个军事基地。当撕裂者攻击车队时，没有人有时间使用战前技术的奇迹。}
### {362}{}{Is she still working?}
{362}{}{她还在工作吗？}
### {363}{}{Almost. During transportation, it was a little battered, but the main systems are normal. The problem is that some parts were stolen in different corners.}
{363}{}{几乎在运输过程中，它有点破旧，但主要系统正常。问题是有些零件在不同的角落被盗。}
### {364}{}{What exactly is missing in this armor?}
{364}{}{这件盔甲到底缺了什么？}
### {365}{}{The nuclear reactor was dismantled for study. Apparently, Levi is considering alternative options for using this energy source.}
{365}{}{核反应堆被拆除进行研究。显然，李维斯正在考虑使用这种能源的其他选择。}
### {366}{}{Something else?}
{366}{}{还有别的吗？}
### {367}{}{Levy keeps the main processor with him so that no one can launch the armor without permission.}
{367}{}{Levy随身携带主处理器，这样任何人都不能在未经许可的情况下发射装甲。}
### {368}{}{Does the helmet come with this car?}
{368}{}{这辆车有头盔吗？}
### {369}{}{The helmet was completely lost somewhere during transportation. Most likely, it lies where the ghouls attacked us.}
{369}{}{头盔在运输过程中完全丢失了。很可能，它就在食尸鬼袭击我们的地方。}
### {370}{}{Now it's clear what to look for.}
{370}{}{现在很清楚该找什么了。}
### {371}{}{Okay, I'll think about it.}
{371}{}{好吧，我会考虑的。}
### {372}{}{I found this helmet near the monument. Will he do?}
{372}{}{我在纪念碑附近发现了这顶头盔。他会这么做吗？}
### {1372}{}{I found this helmet near the monument. Will he do?}
{1372}{}{我在纪念碑附近发现了这顶头盔。他会这么做吗？}
### {373}{}{Yes, that's him. Just connect it to the armor.}
{373}{}{是的，就是他。只要把它连接到盔甲上。}
### {374}{}{OK.}
{374}{}{好啊}

### {380}{}{What do you know about Levi and his cult?}
{380}{}{你对李维和他的崇拜了解多少？}
### {381}{}{Quite a bit. But it's enough to respect and hate him at the same time.}
{381}{}{很多但同时尊重和憎恨他就足够了。}
### {382}{}{Enough about the cult.}
{382}{}{邪教已经够多了。}
### {383}{}{Who is he?}
{383}{}{他是谁？}
### {384}{}{Levi was one of the minions of the Creator, like Morpheus and other close associates. He followed his leader to the end until the cult was destroyed in 2161.}
{384}{}{李维是造物主的小黄人之一，就像墨菲斯和其他亲密伙伴一样。他一直追随他的领袖直到2161年邪教被摧毁。}
### {385}{}{Is he a mutant too?}
{385}{}{他也是变种人吗？}
### {386}{}{Levi accepted the mutagen as part of the initiation. And now he's suffering from side effects. Therefore, he wears a mask to reduce the harmful effects of poisonous air. Although his subordinates don't need it.}
{386}{}{李维接受了诱变剂作为启动的一部分。现在他正遭受副作用的折磨。因此，他戴上口罩以减少有毒空气的有害影响。尽管他的下属并不需要。}
### {387}{}{What brought him to these ruins?}
{387}{}{是什么把他带到这些废墟上的？}
### {388}{}{You see, these days the people of California have expelled people like him. I think these ruins seemed to Levi a reliable Vault from the rest of the world. After all, no normal person would climb into such radioactive dirt. Well, except for you and me.}
{388}{}{你看，这些天加州人民驱逐了像他这样的人。我认为这些废墟在李维看来是来自世界其他地方的可靠避难所。毕竟，没有一个正常人会爬进这种放射性的泥土里。好吧，除了你和我。}
### {389}{}{What does Levi want from you?}
{389}{}{李维想从你那里得到什么？}
### {390}{}{He needs my scientific skills for the "complementation project". That's what he calls it.}
{390}{}{他需要我的科学技能来进行“互补工程”。这就是他所说的。}
### {391}{}{Project of what?}
{391}{}{什么项目？}
### {392}{}{Complementation project - what does it mean?}
{392}{}{互补项目――这意味着什么？}
### {393}{}{It's hard to explain, and I wasn't privy to everything. You see, Levi's people are the fruit of an old experiment. Do you want to know the details?}
{393}{}{这很难解释，而且我并不是什么都知道。你看，李维斯的人是一个古老实验的成果。你想知道细节吗？}
### {394}{}{I'm not up to history right now. We need to think about how to get out of this hell.}
{394}{}{我现在不了解历史。我们需要考虑如何走出这地狱。}
### {395}{}{No, let's skip the story. What exactly does Levi need?}
{395}{}{不，我们跳过这个故事。李维到底需要什么？}
### {396}{}{Yes, tell me, what kind of experiments?}
{396}{}{是的，告诉我，什么样的实验？}
### {397}{}{A few years ago, the cult of the Creator flourished in the West. He used the pre-war virus to create his own army of super mutants. The Creator was killed, and his army fled in different directions.}
{397}{}{几年前，对造物主的崇拜在西方盛行。他利用战前的病毒创建了自己的超级变种人大军。造物主被杀，他的军队向不同的方向逃跑。}
### {398}{}{Levi's people are the remnants of this cult?}
{398}{}{李维斯的人是这个邪教的残余？}
### {399}{}{Right. But the Creator's experiments had a very wide range of consequences. Both successful and fatal. All these mutants suffer from defects in one way or another.}
{399}{}{正确的但是造物主的实验产生了非常广泛的后果。既成功又致命。所有这些突变体都有这样或那样的缺陷。}
### {400}{}{And Levi is trying to heal them?}
{400}{}{李维想治好他们？}
### {401}{}{To begin with, it is necessary to stabilize the virus in the blood of these people. Some of them are wasting away from the lack of the virus, others from its excess, and all have their own individual pathologies.}
{401}{}{首先，有必要稳定这些人血液中的病毒。他们中的一些人因缺乏病毒而消瘦，另一些人则因病毒过多而消瘦，而且都有自己的个体病理。}
### {402}{}{Go on.}
{402}{}{继续}
### {403}{}{It is also curious that Levi is trying to tame wild rippers, make them his servants, although their nature is significantly different from Levi's ghouls.}
{403}{}{同样令人好奇的是，李维正试图驯服野生食尸鬼，让它们成为他的仆人，尽管它们的本性与李维的食尸鬼有很大不同。}
### {404}{}{And what will happen in the end?}
{404}{}{最终会发生什么？}
### {405}{}{Something like a small mutant empire. A radioactive paradise for the elite. The path here will be closed to a mere mortal.}
{405}{}{有点像一个小小的变种帝国。精英阶层的放射性天堂。这里的道路将对一个凡人关闭。}
### {406}{}{Interesting. But let's go back. What exactly does Levi want from you?}
{406}{}{有趣的但我们还是回去吧。李维到底想从你那里得到什么？}
### {407}{}{Levi demands a virus stabilizer for his flock. The fact is that some of his people lack mutagen, so they are forced to take stimpack medications or endure pain. Others, on the contrary, are looking for a way to suppress the virus so as not to turn completely into a carrot.}
{407}{}{李维要求为他的羊群提供一种病毒稳定剂。事实上，他的一些人缺乏诱变剂，所以他们被迫服用刺激药物或忍受疼痛。相反，其他人正在寻找一种抑制病毒的方法，以免完全变成胡萝卜。}
### {408}{}{Sounds too difficult, given the surrounding mess.}
{408}{}{考虑到周围的混乱，听起来太难了。}
### {409}{}{Um, forget it.}
{409}{}{嗯，算了。}
### {410}{}{Exactly. Fortunately, Levi brought a small laboratory with him. The main problem is the lack of synthesized substances, especially benzene and pesticides. If I had more raw materials, I would have found a solution to the mutagen problem.}
{410}{}{确切地幸运的是，李维带了一个小实验室。主要问题是缺乏合成物质，特别是苯和杀虫剂。如果我有更多的原材料，我就会找到诱变剂问题的解决方案。}
### {411}{}{Crazy! Do you want to cure these mutants? How about spraying mutagenic poison all over this devil's church?}
{411}{}{疯子你想治好这些变种人吗？在这个魔鬼教堂到处喷洒致突变毒药怎么样？}
### {412}{}{I understand your displeasure. And yet these people can also be understood. They've been through a lot. Perhaps my help will change them for the better.}
{412}{}{我理解你的不满。然而，这些人也可以被理解。他们经历了很多。也许我的帮助会让他们变得更好。}
### {413}{}{Well, well. And yet I insist on poison. If possible.}
{413}{}{嗯，嗯。但我坚持要下毒。如果可能的话。}
### {414}{}{Perhaps. I really hope that you are not mistaken in your calculations.}
{414}{}{可能我真的希望你的计算没有错。}
### {415}{}{If you make a mutagen, then Levi will let us go. It's worth a try. It won't get any worse anyway.}
{415}{}{如果你制造了一种诱变剂，那么李维会让我们走的。值得一试。无论如何，情况不会变得更糟。}
### {416}{}{Exactly. My heart sinks when I try to imagine what these people went through.}
{416}{}{确切地当我试图想象这些人所经历的一切时，我的心都沉了下来。}
### {417}{}{Although it would be easier to shoot them all. And what is needed there for the mutagen?}
{417}{}{尽管把它们全部射杀会更容易。诱变剂需要什么？}
### {418}{}{Okay. But where can I get all these substances?}
{418}{}{可以但是我在哪里可以得到这些物质？}
### {419}{}{I was carrying a chemical bag with me. There was everything you needed. But Levi's men could not find him. Surely one of the rippers dragged the box to the ruins.}
{419}{}{我当时带着一个化学袋。里面有你需要的一切。但李维的人找不到他。肯定是其中一个撕咬者把箱子拖到了废墟上。}
### {420}{}{Well, I'm always looking for someone or something.}
{420}{}{嗯，我一直在找某人或某事。}
### {421}{}{Please find this box. The ambush was near the monument on the fifth highway. It's not far west of here.}
{421}{}{请找到这个盒子。伏击发生在第五条高速公路上的纪念碑附近。它在这里西面不远处。}
### {422}{}{Wait for my return.}
{422}{}{等我回来。}
### {423}{}{Okay. But don't regret it.}
{423}{}{可以但不要后悔。}
### {424}{}{Remind me what I need to find?}
{424}{}{提醒我需要查找什么？}

### {430}{}{Here's your chemical kit.}
{430}{}{这是你的化学试剂盒。}
### {431}{}{Thank god! I was already afraid that the ghouls had gutted him. So... Yes, there is what you need here. First you need to conduct some experiments. Put the kit on that lab table over there...}
{431}{}{感谢上帝！我已经害怕食尸鬼已经把他干掉了。所以…是的，这里有你需要的。首先你需要做一些实验。把试剂盒放在那边的实验室桌子上。。。}
### {432}{}{[Next]}
{432}{}{[下一个]}
### {433}{}{... so... hmm... Hand me that test tube over there... Look, it's turning green. Now it's a small matter - we need to conduct clinical trials. Fortunately, we have prototypes.}
{433}{}{…所以…嗯…把那边的试管递给我。。。看，它变绿了。现在这只是一件小事――我们需要进行临床试验。幸运的是，我们有原型。}
### {434}{}{Do you want to use those rippers? It looks like we have no other choice.}
{434}{}{你想用那些撕裂器吗？看来我们别无选择。}
### {435}{}{You're a real sadie, Diana. And I'm starting to like you.}
{435}{}{你真是个虐待狂，黛安娜。我开始喜欢你了。}
### {436}{}{Hmm-m... How interesting. Please note that the test subjects have become calmer. Now I'm going to look at their blood cells through a microscope... so... Hey, we did it! I think this is exactly what Levi wanted.}
{436}{}{嗯。。。真有趣。请注意，受试者已经变得更冷静了。现在我要用显微镜观察他们的血细胞。。。所以…嘿，我们做到了！我想这正是李维想要的。}
### {437}{}{Good news. I'll talk to Levi.}
{437}{}{好消息。我会和李维谈谈。}
### {438}{}{It so happened that I already have your things.}
{438}{}{碰巧我已经有你的东西了。}
### {439}{}{There is no need to kill anyone. I won't be able to test the mutagen on the dead. }
{439}{}{没有必要杀人。我无法在死者身上测试诱变剂。}

### {450}{}{Get ready. We're leaving.}
{450}{}{做好准备。我们要走了。}
### {451}{}{Are you sure this is the right thing to do? I wouldn't want to be caught in the crossfire again.}
{451}{}{你确定这样做是正确的吗？我不想再陷入交火。}
### {1451}{}{Are you sure this is the right thing to do? I don't want to be caught in the crossfire again.}
{1451}{}{你确定这样做是正确的吗？我不想再次陷入交火。}
### {452}{}{You're right, we need to scout the situation first. I'll be back soon.}
{452}{}{你说得对，我们需要先调查一下情况。我很快就会回来。}
### {453}{}{Levi is dead. I doubt that the rest of the mutants will be happy to see us as well.}
{453}{}{李维死了。我怀疑其他变种人也会很高兴见到我们。}
### {454}{}{Is Levi dead? How sad it is... Well, it's really not safe in the temple now. I doubt that I will be of any use here.}
{454}{}{李维死了吗？这是多么可悲……嗯，现在在寺庙里真的不安全。我怀疑我在这里是否有用。}
### {455}{}{Exactly. We need to get out of here. And as soon as possible.}
{455}{}{确切地我们需要离开这里。并且尽快。}
### {456}{}{Actually, this is not accurate information. Wait until I check.}
{456}{}{事实上，这不是准确的信息。等我检查一下。}
### {457}{}{It's dangerous. But it's getting more dangerous by the hour. We must hurry if we want to survive. Let's go.}
{457}{}{这很危险。但它一小时比一小时危险。如果我们想生存，就必须抓紧时间。我们走吧。}
### {458}{}{I really hope you know what you're doing.}
{458}{}{我真的希望你知道你在做什么。}
### {459}{}{Trust me. I'll get you out of this hell.}
{459}{}{相信我，我会把你从地狱里救出来的。}
### {460}{}{Hmm. Your words make me think. Wait a little longer. I'm on a reconnaissance mission.}
{460}{}{嗯，你的话让我思考。再等一会儿。我在执行侦察任务。}
### {461}{}{Levi gave us freedom. We can leave.}
{461}{}{李维给了我们自由。我们可以离开。}
### {462}{}{Thank god! I believed that Levi was a good man and he would keep his word.}
