#{304}{}{It's a waste to let you in there, babe.}
{304}{}{让你进去太浪费了，宝贝。}
#{305}{}{You should use your body for something better than a lunch for deathclaws.}
{305}{}{你应该用你的身体做些比给死爪吃午餐更好的事。}
#{306}{}{That tin foil won't be of much use to you.}
{306}{}{那锡纸对你没有多大用处。}
#{307}{}{I bet those deathclaws will get through that armor in no time.}
{307}{}{我敢打赌那些致命的爪子很快就会穿过盔甲。}
#{308}{}{You've got too much confidence.}
{308}{}{你太自信了。}

#{550}{}{This here passage in the rock is the way to Lost Town, which by itself is far from being a safe place, but the main problem is inside. [He points towards the entrance.] There are deathclaws in there.}
{550}{}{岩石中的这条通道是通往失落小镇的路，小镇本身远不是一个安全的地方，但主要问题是里面。[他指着入口]里面有死爪。}
#{551}{}{Deathclaws?}
{551}{}{死爪？}
#{552}{}{What's in Lost Town?}
{552}{}{迷失之城有什么？}
#{553}{}{Is there any other way how to get to Lost Town?}
{553}{}{去迷路镇还有别的路吗？}
#{554}{}{So nobody here goes to Lost Town?}
{554}{}{所以这里没人去迷路镇？}

#{558}{}{Thanks for the heads up.}

#{600}{}{You might've heard all kinds of stories about them, but deathclaws are no fucking myth. They're real, and able to rip you to pieces in seconds.}
{600}{}{你可能听过关于它们的各种各样的故事，但死亡之爪不是他妈的神话。它们是真的，能在几秒钟内把你撕成碎片。}

#{605}{}{Why don't you just shoot them dead?}
{605}{}{你为什么不开枪打死他们？}
#{606}{}{Thanks for the heads up.}
{606}{}{谢谢你的提醒。}
#{650}{}{It's a scum pit filled with criminals and junkies. We have no influence there, so it's run by a guy named Rodriguez. He's a mobster who owns the local casino and god knows what else.}
{650}{}{这是一个充斥着罪犯和瘾君子的人渣坑。我们在那里没有影响力，所以它是由一个叫罗德里格斯的人经营的。他是当地赌场的老板，天知道还有什么。}
#{651}{}{Tell me about deathclaws.}
{651}{}{告诉我死爪的事。}
#{652}{}{So there's no other way how to get there?}
{652}{}{所以没别的办法了？}
#{653}{}{So nobody here goes there?}
{653}{}{所以这里没人去那里？}
#{654}{}{Why don't you just shoot those deathclaws dead?}
{654}{}{你为什么不把那些死爪打死？}
#{655}{}{Thanks for the heads up.}
{655}{}{谢谢你的提醒。}
#{700}{}{Only if you left the city and went all the way round them rocks, but it's a damn long stretch to walk and you probably wouldn't find it, anyways, if you haven't been there before.}
{700}{}{如果你离开了城市，绕着石头走了一圈，但是走起来要走很长一段路，如果你以前没有去过那里，你可能就找不到了。}

#{706}{}{Thanks for the advice.}
{706}{}{谢谢你的建议。}
#{750}{}{There's always a couple of madmen trying to slip through, but they rarely make it through. You can't outrun a deathclaw once it's spotted you.}
{750}{}{总有几个疯子想溜过去，但他们很少成功。一旦死爪发现你，你就跑不过它。}
#{751}{}{Deathclaws?}
{751}{}{死爪？}

{755}{}{谢谢你的提醒。}
#{800}{}{Yeah, sure, why didn't we think of that idea before?! After all, all men are hot for trying their fightin' skills against huge, fast beasts with claws that rip through armor like a knife through butter. Jokes aside, what would be the point? The way I see it, they at least discourage the smarter people from going to Lost Town. And the dumb ones? Well, sometimes you can hear them scream from right here.}
{800}{}{是的，当然，为什么我们以前没想到这个主意？！毕竟，所有的男人都热衷于尝试他们的格斗技巧来对付那些爪子像刀子穿过黄油一样撕破盔甲的又大又快的野兽。撇开玩笑不谈，重点是什么？在我看来，他们至少阻止了更聪明的人去失落的小镇。那些笨蛋呢？嗯，有时候你能听到他们从这里尖叫。}
#{801}{}{So what are you standing here for if you leave the deathclaws be and you don't stop people from going in?}
{801}{}{如果你离开死亡爪不阻止人们进去，你站在这里干什么？}

#{806}{}{Thanks for the heads up.}

#{850}{}{We're here to stop the deathclaws from entering the town. Fortunately, they keep to the inside of the cave, so it's an easy shift.}
{850}{}{我们是来阻止死亡之爪进城的。幸运的是，他们一直呆在洞穴里面，所以这是一个很容易的转变。}
