#Dialogue on the Ranger map
### {200}{}{Hey, you! Call the general immediately!}
{200}{}{嘿，你！立即致电将军！}
### {201}{}{Woman, stop yelling, you can be heard well enough.}
{201}{}{女人，别大喊大叫了，你的声音已经足够好了。}
### {202}{}{You're confusing something, I'm here in passing.}
{202}{}{你搞糊涂了，我正好在这儿。}
### {203}{}{Yes, of course, also tell me that you don't serve the damn rangers! In these lands, even coyotes suck up to those who are stronger.}
{203}{}{是的，当然，也告诉我，你不为该死的护林员服务！在这些土地上，即使是郊狼也会讨好那些更强壮的人。}
### {204}{}{Did the Rangers annoy you somehow?}
{204}{}{游骑兵队不知怎么惹恼了你吗？}
### {205}{}{That's not the word! And I'm not going to let it go that easily. If the general doesn't come out here to answer, I'll fight my way to him myself.}
{205}{}{不是这个词！我不会那么轻易放手的。如果将军不来这里回答，我会亲自向他讨伐。}
### {206}{}{You again? If you don't want to help, then you'd better disappear from my eyes.}
{206}{}{你又来了？如果你不想帮忙，那你最好从我眼前消失。}
### {207}{}{Stay here, I'll talk to the Rangers.}
{207}{}{呆在这里，我和游骑兵队谈谈。}
### {208}{}{Tell me what happened.}
{208}{}{告诉我发生了什么事。}
### {209}{}{These "defenders of the law" executed my husband and left me and my child to the mercy of the desert. We miraculously managed to survive the way here.}
{209}{}{这些“法律卫士”处决了我的丈夫，让我和我的孩子任由沙漠摆布。我们奇迹般地活了下来。}
### {210}{}{Was he guilty?}
{210}{}{他有罪吗？}
### {211}{}{Guilty? Yes, everyone in the wastelands is guilty of a variety of atrocities, if you follow the stupid law that the rangers cherish so much. But this does not mean that now we have to execute everyone in a row!}
{211}{}{内疚的是的，如果你遵循护林员非常珍视的愚蠢法律，荒原上的每个人都会犯下各种暴行。但这并不意味着现在我们必须连续处决所有人！}
### {212}{}{Eh, I understand what you want to say.}
{212}{}{呃，我理解你的意思。}
### {213}{}{Why do you need a general?}
{213}{}{你为什么需要一个将军？}
### {214}{}{To look him in the eye. He may not know what his henchmen are doing, but I will still make him answer for their mistakes and pay me compensation.}
{214}{}{看着他的眼睛。他可能不知道他的党羽在做什么，但我仍然会让他为他们的错误负责，并赔偿我。}
### {215}{}{A bold decision.}
{215}{}{一个大胆的决定。}
### {216}{}{Is that all you wanted to ask?}
{216}{}{你只想问这些吗？}
### {217}{}{Is this your baby?}
{217}{}{这是你的孩子吗？}
### {218}{}{Yes. What's it to you?}
{218}{}{对你怎么了？}
### {219}{}{I was just curious. Forget.}
{219}{}{我只是好奇。忘记}

### {220}{}{You can't stay here. The Rangers do not want to take you under protection, and your reputation will not allow you to settle in neighboring settlements.}
{220}{}{你不能呆在这里。游骑兵不想保护你，你的名声也不允许你在附近的定居点定居。}
### {221}{}{I know! But where do we go now? There is a desert around, we will not survive another such trip. However, you can try to go to California... This is the only way out. But the Rangers blocked the only crossing of the river!}
{221}{}{我知道！但我们现在该去哪里？周围有一片沙漠，我们再也活不下去了。不过，你可以试着去加利福尼亚...这是唯一的出路。但是游骑兵队挡住了唯一的渡河通道！}
### {222}{}{They say there is a ferry downstream. But it's not a safe place.}
{222}{}{他们说下游有一艘渡船。但这不是一个安全的地方。}
### {223}{}{Exactly. I don't even have a gun to protect me from wolves and pig rats. I can't get to the ferry with my child without help.}
{223}{}{确切地我甚至没有枪来保护我免受狼和猪鼠的伤害。没有人帮忙，我带着孩子上不了渡船。}
### {224}{}{I'll accompany you. Get ready to ship.}
{224}{}{我陪你。准备发货。}
### {225}{}{I'll accompany you. But not right now.}
{225}{}{我陪你。但现在不行。}

### {226}{}{The guards are dead.}
{226}{}{警卫已经死了。}
### {227}{}{I see, but it doesn't change anything. We can't get to the General anyway. There are also a lot of rangers inside the dam. We won't even be able to approach the citadel on the other side of the dam. We will either be shot by snipers or caught by patrolmen.}
{227}{}{我明白了，但这不会改变任何事情。我们无论如何都无法找到将军。大坝内部也有很多护林员。我们甚至无法接近大坝另一边的城堡。我们要么被狙击手射杀，要么被巡警抓住。}
### {228}{}{The General is dead.}
{228}{}{将军死了。}
### {229}{}{Are you sure you know that? Is this not a trick? However, I have already heard this news. It looks like he really gave up the ghost. Great. I feel better. But I don't understand what to do now.}
{229}{}{你确定你知道吗？这不是一个把戏吗？然而，我已经听到了这个消息。看起来他真的放弃了鬼魂。太棒了我感觉好多了。但我不明白现在该怎么办。}

### {230}{}{Hey, traveler. You're trying to escape from this hell too, right?}
{230}{}{嘿，旅行家。你也想逃离这个地狱，对吧？}
### {1230}{}{Hey, wayfarer. You're trying to escape from this hell too, right?}
{1230}{}{嘿，旅行家。你也想逃离这个地狱，对吧？}
### {231}{}{What are you talking about?}
{231}{}{你在说什么？}
### {232}{}{Maybe.}
{232}{}{大概}
### {233}{}{The Rangers have ruined our family's life. I don't want to tell you the details. After all, they already got what they deserved, if you look at this dam.}
{233}{}{游骑兵队毁了我们全家的生活。我不想告诉你细节。毕竟，如果你看看这座大坝，他们已经得到了他们应得的。}
### {234}{}{[Next]}
{234}{}{[下一个]}
### {235}{}{Hmm, you don't look like a dangerous person. We have to stick together. Will you help me get to the other side? There is a ferry downstream, but I'm afraid to go there without an escort. They say there are wolves in those places.}
{235}{}{嗯，你看起来不像一个危险的人。我们必须团结一致。你能帮我到另一边吗？下游有一艘渡船，但我害怕没有人护送就去那里。他们说那些地方有狼。}
### {236}{}{Okay, I'll escort you. We're leaving right now.}
{236}{}{好的，我护送你。我们现在就要走了。}
### {237}{}{I can't help you. Maybe later.}
{237}{}{我帮不了你。也许以后吧。}
### {238}{}{Have you changed your mind after all? Come with us. Why do you need these desolate lands? In California, you can forget about the past and start all over again.}
{238}{}{你到底改变主意了吗？跟我们来。你为什么需要这些荒凉的土地？在加州，你可以忘记过去，重新开始。}
### {1238}{}{Have you changed your mind after all? Come with us. Why do you need these desolate lands? In California, you can forget about the past and start all over again.}
{1238}{}{你到底改变主意了吗？跟我们来。你为什么需要这些荒凉的土地？在加州，你可以忘记过去，重新开始。}
### {239}{}{[Next]}
{239}{}{[下一个]}
### {240}{}{You know, I don't get along with the Rangers either.}
{240}{}{你知道，我和游骑兵队也相处不好。}
### {241}{}{Is that supposed to make me feel better? Hmm. Listen, since we're in the same boat, then we should help each other to survive.}
{241}{}{这会让我感觉好些吗？嗯。听着，既然我们在同一条船上，那么我们应该互相帮助才能生存。}

#On the ferry map
### {300}{}{Let's talk when we get to the ferry. Now we can attract wolves with our voice.}
{300}{}{我们到渡船时谈谈。现在我们可以用我们的声音吸引狼了。}
### {301}{}{You're right, let's put aside talking for now.}
{301}{}{你说得对，我们暂时别谈了。}
### {302}{}{I see.}
{302}{}{我明白了。}

### {303}{}{I don't like the way you look at the baby. Don't try to scare him, otherwise you won't see anything else for the rest of your life.}
{303}{}{我不喜欢你看孩子的样子。不要试图吓唬他，否则你一辈子都看不到其他东西了。}
### {304}{}{I had no such thoughts!}
{304}{}{我没有这样的想法！}
### {305}{}{It's not in your best interest to threaten me, woman.}
{305}{}{威胁我不符合你的最佳利益，女人。}

### {310}{}{What's your name, woman?}
{310}{}{你叫什么名字，女人？}
### {311}{}{My name is Cecilia, and this is my son.}
{311}{}{我叫塞西莉亚，这是我的儿子。}
### {312}{}{Your son has different facial features.}
{312}{}{你儿子有不同的面部特征。}
### {313}{}{Because he's adopted. I found it in the ruins and couldn't get past it.}
{313}{}{因为他被收养了。我在废墟中发现了它，无法通过。}
### {314}{}{Was your husband really a criminal?}
{314}{}{你丈夫真的是罪犯吗？}
### {315}{}{I didn't ask where he gets his food and things from. But it was obvious that he was robbing travelers and farmers. So he protected the family. We had to survive somehow. It was worse in Phoenix, he was forced to do much dirtier work.}
{315}{}{我没有问他从哪里得到食物和东西。但很明显，他在抢劫旅行者和农民。所以他保护了这个家庭。我们不得不以某种方式生存下来。菲尼克斯的情况更糟，他被迫做更脏的工作。}
### {316}{}{Have you escaped from Phoenix?}
{316}{}{你逃出凤凰城了吗？}
### {317}{}{Yes... A big city. A lot of people, few resources. On the wastelands you are honest with fate, but in the city you always have to be on someone's side and fulfill someone's whims.}
{317}{}{对一个大城市。人多资源少。在荒原上，你对命运很诚实，但在城市里，你总是必须站在别人一边，满足别人的奇思妙想。}
### {318}{}{Do you hate Rangers now?}
{318}{}{你现在讨厌游骑兵队吗？}

### {321}{}{But it happened. It's their fault. You can't fix it.}
{321}{}{但事情发生了。这是他们的错。你无法修复它。}
### {322}{}{In my village, this would not be approved either.}
{322}{}{在我的村子里，这也不会得到批准。}
### {323}{}{Hmm, in our Villa, every peasant also stands below the community and fulfills its whims. But it's not the same thing.}
{323}{}{嗯，在我们的别墅里，每个农民也站在社区的下面，满足他们的奇思妙想。但这不是一回事。}
### {324}{}{This is commendable.}
{324}{}{这是值得赞扬的。}
### {325}{}{I should have warned you in advance.}
{325}{}{我应该事先警告你的。}

### {330}{}{The ferry is ready to depart. Get on the platform, I'll ferry you.}
{330}{}{渡船准备出发了。上站台，我送你。}
### {331}{}{I am immensely grateful to you. Not everyone would help us, especially in the Ranger lands. But what about you? Will you come to California with us?}
{331}{}{我非常感谢你。不是每个人都会帮助我们，尤其是在流浪者队。但是你呢？你会和我们一起去加利福尼亚吗？}
### {332}{}{I can't yet. I have obligations to my family and home.}
{332}{}{我还不能。我对我的家庭和家负有义务。}
### {333}{}{That's how. It's not often that you find communities so strong that someone owes them something. Then good luck to you. Thanks for everything.}

{335}{}{我希望我有什么要感谢你的。但如果你发现自己在凤凰城，告诉赌场的酒保我的事，也许他会给你折扣。现在再见。}
