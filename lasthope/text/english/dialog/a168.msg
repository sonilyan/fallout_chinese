{100}{}{[You notice a similar module installed in this unit.] (You can't stop but wonder if this module will
 perform any better than the one you bought...)}
{101}{}{[Try to pull out the module...] (Your hands never let you down before.)}
{102}{}{[Use your science skill to examine the unit...]}
{103}{}{I'll turn off the control unit and take out the module... (Sounds logical, but...)}
{104}{}{[Leave it alone.]}
#pull...
{105}{}{[You were so eager to pull this off, that you forgot to unplug the unit and touched it while running at full
 power... You feel the wrath of god running through your spine... Your death was inevitable.]}

{107}{}{[After an hour or so, you can't reach any conclusion.] (Maybe some things are better left alone.)}

#skill...SC>70
{110}{}{[You've figured out several options...]}
{111}{}{[Turn off the whole station and extract the module.] (I think it's safer than just turning off the control unit and
 leaving the rest of the system unmonitored.)}
{112}{}{[Replace the module with the one you have.] (Might work but I'm not sure how well it will perform with this
 old module.)}
{113}{}{[Pretend you don't care for once.] (Maybe this station can operate without a control unit?)}
{114}{}{[Override the safety procedures and bypass the module's circuitry with some carefully placed wires.] Then I
 can take out the module...}
#103,113...
{115}{}{[You turn off the control unit and take out the module... Nothing happens.] (Your guess is it will run as long
 as the water flow through the pipes stays constant or... the whole town could run out of drinking water.)}
{116}{}{Let's hope it does, fingers crossed...}
#111...
{117}{}{[It turns out to be an effective way of cutting the water supply for the entire city.] (At least this will
 get the processing machine up and running... You stand by your conviction it was the right choice.)}

#112...
{119}{}{(Your gut tells you this could be the long term solution you were looking for. Other than that, it's pure
 guesswork.)}
{120}{}{Let's give it a try...}
#114
{121}{}{[You remove the module after skillfully reconnecting the wiring. It seems that the control unit retained some
 of the module's basic functions, stored in its memory, enough to keep it operational.]}
{122}{}{That's what I'm talking about.}
#
{123}{}{[That working module still sits in its socket...] (and may well be used as the replacement for the damaged
 processing machine.)}
{124}{}{[More.]}
{125}{}{[Back.]}
#
{126}{}{(You don't think tampering with it would be such a good idea, not after your latest adjustments.)}

{128}{}{This control unit is using a rare type of module, looks like a pretty expensive piece of equipment to
 manufacture back in the day.} #display
