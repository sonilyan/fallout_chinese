{510}{}{我急需你的帮助，医生。你能解释一下这张纸条吗？[把坟墓里的纸条递给他。]}
#{511}{}{What do you want?! Can't you see what happened here? That madman tried to slit my throat right in my office! I still have the image in my eyes. [He lays his right hand on his chest and breathes out loudly.] So tell me, what's so important that you have to bother me with it?}
{511}{}{你想要什么？！你没看到这里发生了什么吗？那个疯子想在我办公室割我的喉咙！我的眼睛里仍然有这个形象。[他把右手放在胸前，大声呼气]那么告诉我，有什么重要的事你要用它来烦我？}
#{550}{}{I have no time for chit-chat. Get out and don't bother me. [He turns away and pays no attention to you anymore.]}
{550}{}{我没有时间闲聊。出去，别打扰我。[他转身离开，不再理你。]}
#{551}{}{[Leave.]}
{551}{}{[离开]}
#{600}{}{Oh damn. Another smart fellow has visited our lovely town, I see. Think for a minute - you're in a hospital, this one in armor and armed with a pistol [He points at the guard.] surely isn't a doctor, so there's just me left.}
{600}{}{哦，该死。另一个聪明人参观了我们可爱的小镇，我明白了。想一想――你在医院里，这个穿着盔甲手持手枪的人（他指着卫兵）肯定不是医生，所以只剩下我了。}
#{601}{}{Ah. In that case, I need a medical attention!}
{601}{}{啊。那样的话，我需要医疗护理！}
#{602}{}{Hey, do you think you're funny? Cool it, or else you'll regret it!}
{602}{}{嘿，你觉得你有趣吗？冷静点，否则你会后悔的！}
#{603}{}{Okay, doctor. I just want to talk to you.}
{603}{}{好的，医生。我只是想和你谈谈。}
#{604}{}{Oh damn. Another smart lassie has visited our lovely town, I see. Think for a minute - you're in a hospital, this one in armor and armed with a pistol [He points at the guard.] surely isn't a doctor, so there's just me left.}
{604}{}{哦，该死。另一个聪明的姑娘参观了我们可爱的小镇，我明白了。想一想――你在医院里，这个穿着盔甲手持手枪的人（他指着卫兵）肯定不是医生，所以只剩下我了。}
#{650}{}{Are you kidding? This place belongs to me, but what the hell do you want here?}
{650}{}{你在开玩笑吗？这地方是我的，但你到底想要什么？}
#{651}{}{I'd like to ask about something.}

#{750}{}{Oh geez. That's why you're bothering me? Yeah, you're right, all those medical instruments, stimpaks, medicine, a guy in a coat, and writing on the building reading CLINIC... That could puzzle anyone!}
{750}{}{哦，天哪。所以你才来烦我？是的，你说得对，所有的医疗器械，兴奋剂，药品，一个穿着外套的人，在大楼里的阅读诊所上写着。。。任何人都会困惑！}
#{751}{}{You're not really nice.}
{751}{}{你不是很好。}
#{752}{}{Ah. In that case, you're a doctor and I need healing!}

#{753}{}{Ah. This is a wrong place to be then.}
{753}{}{啊。这是个错误的地方。}
#{800}{}{Hey, young fart, why don't you simply buzz off then?}
{800}{}{嘿，小屁孩，你为什么不干脆走开呢？}
#{801}{}{I need some healing, that's why.}
{801}{}{我需要一些治疗，这就是为什么。}
#{802}{}{Enough, nobody's going to talk to me like this!}
{802}{}{够了，没人会这样跟我说话！}
#{803}{}{You can be sure I'm on my way. I won't waste my time here.}
{803}{}{你可以确定我在路上。我不会在这里浪费时间的。}
#{804}{}{Hey, young fart, why don't you simply buzz off then?}

{908}{}{50个治疗帽？太贵了，你不觉得吗？}
#{909}{}{That much? No way I can afford it.}

#{951}{}{What about paying you later? I really need to be healed.}
{951}{}{迟些付钱给你怎么样？我真的需要治愈。}

#{1101}{}{And don't you think this is expensive a bit?}
{1101}{}{你不觉得这有点贵吗？}
#{1102}{}{Ah. I'll return when I get enough money.}
{1102}{}{啊。我拿到足够的钱就回来。}
#{1150}{}{It's not overpriced. I have to have higher prices for I'm running out of material. Do you know how hard is it to get good medicine? There isn't enough even for me. I have a weak heart, which I cannot treat. My supplies are that low.}
{1150}{}{价格并不高。我的材料快用完了，我得加价。你知道要买到好药有多难吗？对我来说都不够。我的心脏很虚弱，我无法治疗。我的供给那么少。}
#{1151}{}{What's the problem?}
{1151}{}{有什么问题吗？}
#{1152}{}{I think you can buy loads of that stuff for the money you charge, no?}
{1152}{}{我想你可以用你的钱买很多东西，不是吗？}
#{1153}{}{Look, not really interested in your problems. Bye.}
{1153}{}{听着，我对你的问题不太感兴趣。再见。}
#{1200}{}{That's it. Everything's fixed so don't hinder me anymore.}

{1204}{}{我也需要你来治疗莱斯特拉。这是瓶盖。}
#{1206}{}{I need you to heal Mutt too.}
{1206}{}{我也需要你治好小狗。}
#{1207}{}{Thanks, doc. I'd like just to know why is it so expensive here?}
{1207}{}{谢谢，医生。我只想知道为什么这里这么贵？}
#{1208}{}{As you wish, doc. Bye.}
{1208}{}{如你所愿，医生。再见。}
#{1250}{}{You don't understand anything. Why do I even talk to you? Get out already.}
{1250}{}{你什么都不懂。我为什么要和你说话？出去吧。}
#{1251}{}{Wait, tell me what's the problem, then?}
{1251}{}{等等，告诉我怎么了？}
#{1252}{}{Okay, I don't have time to waste here either. See you.}
{1252}{}{好吧，我也没时间浪费在这里。再见。}
#{1300}{}{Has nobody told you about this town? Just so you know - people from the North Side don't get on well with people from here, and the only place where we can get the stuff we need is the North Side.}
{1300}{}{没人告诉过你这个镇吗？你要知道，北边的人和这里的人相处不好，我们唯一能得到我们需要的东西的地方就是北边。}
#{1301}{}{Well?}
{1301}{}{好？}
#{1302}{}{I get it. Even though you have enough money, you can't send anyone to Leonard's people to do the shopping.}
{1302}{}{我明白了。即使你有足够的钱，你也不能派任何人去伦纳德家购物。}
#{1350}{}{You're not the sharpest tool in the shed, really... Try to understand; We do have money, but we simply cannot spend it in the North Side.}
{1350}{}{你不是棚里最锋利的工具，真的。。。试着去理解，我们确实有钱，但我们不能把钱花在北边。}
#{1351}{}{You're not the sharpest tool in the shed, really... Try to understand; We do have money, but we simply cannot spend it in the North Side.}
{1351}{}{你不是棚里最锋利的工具，真的。。。试着去理解，我们确实有钱，但我们不能把钱花在北边。}
#{1352}{}{Ah, they won't do business with anyone from here.}
{1352}{}{啊，他们不会和这里的人做生意的。}
#{1353}{}{Ah, well nevermind, not interested in your problems. Bye.}
{1353}{}{啊，没关系，对你的问题不感兴趣。再见。}
#{1400}{}{Yep, correct. Actually, none of us could even step in the North Side without needing to be patched up by me afterwards... Well, if it would be worth it anymore.}
{1400}{}{是的，没错。事实上，我们谁也不可能不经过我的修补就走到北边。。。好吧，如果还值得的话。}
#{1401}{}{In that case, it's clear why your prices are high. I have to go, bye.}
{1401}{}{既然如此，你方价格高的原因就很清楚了。我得走了，再见。}
#{1402}{}{I understand your problem and it seems I could help you.}
{1402}{}{我理解你的问题，看来我能帮你。}
#{1403}{}{I understand your problem and it seems I could help you.}
{1403}{}{我理解你的问题，看来我能帮你。}
#{1450}{}{You want to help? Go talk with Julian about that; I'm sure he'll accept you and your proposal.}
{1450}{}{你想帮忙吗？去和朱利安谈谈，我相信他会接受你和你的建议的。}
#{1451}{}{Good, I'll go see him right away.}
{1451}{}{很好，我马上去看他。}
#{1452}{}{I'll think about it. Can you answer some more questions?}
{1452}{}{我会考虑的。你能再回答几个问题吗？}
#{1500}{}{You hindered me way too much. I have no time for talking with you anymore.}
{1500}{}{你妨碍我太多了。我再也没有时间和你说话了。}
#{1501}{}{[Leave.]}
{1501}{}{[离开]}
#{1550}{}{Great. This is the list of the essential stuff: two bottles of Buffout, three stimpaks, and one antidote. Can you remember that? A doctor's bag would come in handy too, but I have no idea if you could get it anywhere around here. If you can, you'll get some extra caps. Got it?}
{1550}{}{伟大的。这是必备品的清单：两瓶咖啡，三瓶兴奋剂，一种解药。你还记得吗？医生的包也会派上用场，但我不知道你能不能在这附近买到。如果可以的话，你会得到一些额外的瓶盖。知道了？}
#{1551}{}{Yep. No problem. I'll be back as soon as I get it all.}
{1551}{}{是的。没问题。我一弄完就回来。}
#{1600}{}{I hope you already have everything and you're not bothering me unnecessarily.}
{1600}{}{我希望你已经拥有了一切，你没有不必要的打扰我。}
#{1601}{}{Sure, here you go. [Show him all the requested things.]}
{1601}{}{当然，给你。[给他看所有要求的东西。]}
#{1602}{}{Not yet, but I'm working on it.}
{1602}{}{还没有，但我正在努力。}
#{1603}{}{Not yet, I'd just like to ask about some stuff.}
{1603}{}{还没有，我只是想问一些事情。}
#{1650}{}{[He looks through the things.] Stimpaks... Buffout... Yep, all is okay save for that goddamn bag. Well nevermind, I guess this is as good as it gets.}
{1650}{}{[他看东西]史汀帕克斯。。。布弗特。。。是的，除了那个该死的包，一切都好。好吧，没关系，我想这是最好的了。}
#{1651}{}{[He looks through the things.] Stimpaks... Buffout... A doctor's bag? Damn, man, you got it after all! That's really great, thanks!}
{1651}{}{[他看东西]史汀帕克斯。。。布弗特。。。医生的包？该死的，伙计，你终于明白了！太棒了，谢谢！}
#{1652}{}{[He looks through the things.] Stimpaks... Buffout... A doctor's bag? Damn, girl, you got it after all! That's really great, thanks!}
{1652}{}{[他看东西]史汀帕克斯。。。布弗特。。。医生的包？妈的，姑娘，你终于明白了！太棒了，谢谢！}
#{1653}{}{And my reward?}
{1653}{}{我的报酬呢？}
#{1700}{}{Julian'll pay you off, so go see him and don't bother me anymore.}
{1700}{}{朱利安会还你钱的，所以去见他，别再烦我了。}
#{1701}{}{OK, bye.}
{1701}{}{好的，再见。}
#{1702}{}{Look, I want to talk to you more.}
{1702}{}{听着，我想和你多谈谈。}
#{1750}{}{What? Again?}
{1750}{}{什么？再一次？}
#{1751}{}{Hurtiiiieeees!}
{1751}{}{受伤的人！}
#{1752}{}{Again, again... Hah Hah...}
{1752}{}{再一次，再一次。。。哈哈。。。}
#{1800}{}{What? [He gets angry.] I'm not a laughingstock! Get out!}
{1800}{}{什么？[他生气了]我不是笑柄！走出！}
#{1801}{}{Boohooo [Leave.]}
{1801}{}{Boohooo[离开]}
#{1802}{}{Noo-o! Nowhere! Nowhere! Nowhere!}
{1802}{}{不！哪里都没有！哪里都没有！哪里都没有！}
#{1850}{}{Oh jeez. It seems I keep attracting idiots today... So listen to me: I can't cure moronism! Get out!}
{1850}{}{哦，天哪。看来我今天一直在吸引白痴。。。所以听我说：我不能治愈白痴！走出！}
#{1851}{}{Nooo dumb... Sob... sob... Booohooo!}
{1851}{}{不，笨蛋。。。呜呜。。。呜呜。。。太棒了！}
#{1852}{}{Mor-mon-ism... what?}
{1852}{}{摩门教。。。什么？}
#{1900}{}{Quiet! Look, for the last time. Stop shouting and get out voluntarily, or...}
{1900}{}{安静的！听着，最后一次。不要大喊大叫，主动出去，否则。。。}
#{1901}{}{Huh?}
{1901}{}{嗯？}
#{1902}{}{Mister... I go bye.}
{1902}{}{先生。。。我走了，再见。}
#{1950}{}{Okay, let me explain it your way: leave or else there will be BANG BANG! Get it?}
{1950}{}{好吧，让我用你的方式来解释：离开，否则会有砰砰的一声！了解了？}
#{1951}{}{Ah... Baiii...}
{1951}{}{啊。。。拜伊。。。}
#{2000}{}{What... Why are you shouting?! Stop it! That's not... [He grabs his chest and starts panting.] Oh well... calm down. Everything is... okay. Just go back through the door you came in through, ok? And nobody'll hurt you. [Silently to himself.] I need peace... I need peace. How can one work here with all this shouting?}
{2000}{}{什么。。。你为什么大喊大叫？！住手！那不是。。。[他抓住胸口开始喘气]哦。。。冷静。一切都是。。。可以。从你进来的那扇门回去，好吗？没人会伤害你。我需要和平。。。我需要和平。一个人怎么能在这里工作？}
#{2001}{}{Hmm... [Leave.]}
{2001}{}{隐马尔可夫模型。。。[离开]}

#{2050}{}{I don't have the patience for this... [He gives a signal to the guard.] Throw him out.}
{2050}{}{我没有耐心。。。[他给警卫一个信号]把他扔出去。}
#{2051}{}{I don't have the patience for this... [He gives a signal to the guard.] Throw her out.}
{2051}{}{我没有耐心。。。[他给警卫一个信号]把她扔出去。}
#{2052}{}{Not away!}
{2052}{}{别走开！}
#{2053}{}{[Let them throw you out.]}
{2053}{}{[让他们把你赶出去。]}
#{2100}{}{Who?... Ah, that'd be the one who ran this place before me. When I came, she'd been long gone. She'd left just some junk; I threw it into some bag. Maybe it's still here somewhere, but I'm not willing to waste my time finding it.}
{2100}{}{谁？。。。啊，就是那个在我之前管理这个地方的人。我来的时候，她早就不在了。她只留下了一些垃圾，我把它扔进了一个袋子里。也许它还在某个地方，但我不愿意浪费时间去找它。}
#{2101}{}{Goddamn, doctor! Either you give it to me, or I'll simply take it.}
{2101}{}{该死的，医生！要么你给我，要么我就拿走。}
#{2102}{}{Would some small financial motivation help with your search?}
{2102}{}{一些小的经济动机对你的搜索有帮助吗？}
#{2103}{}{Doctor, listen! It's about the clue to the murder of George's dauther. I want to unravel the mystery of her death.}
{2103}{}{医生，听着！是关于谋杀乔治女儿的线索。我想揭开她死亡的神秘面纱。}
#{2150}{}{Do you know you're annoying me terribly today? If you get out, while you can use your own legs, I'll overlook even the threats you seem to be pulling.}
{2150}{}{你知道你今天很烦我吗？如果你出去，虽然你可以用你自己的腿，我会忽略甚至威胁你似乎拉。}
#{2151}{}{Bad luck, doctor. I meant it!}
{2151}{}{祝你好运，医生。我是认真的！}
#{2152}{}{Bad luck, doctor. I meant it!}
{2152}{}{祝你好运，医生。我是认真的！}
#{2153}{}{Fine, but we're not over yet.}
{2153}{}{好吧，但我们还没结束。}
#{2200}{}{That depends on... Eh... the amount of your motivation.}
{2200}{}{这取决于。。。呃。。。你的动机。}
#{2201}{}{What about 20 caps?}
{2201}{}{20个怎么样？}
#{2202}{}{What about 40 caps?}
{2202}{}{40个瓶盖怎么样？}
#{2203}{}{What about 60 caps?}
{2203}{}{60顶怎么样？}
#{2204}{}{Hm, I don't have many caps to spare. Talk to you later.}
{2204}{}{嗯，我没有多余的瓶盖了。待会儿再谈。}
#{2250}{}{For that amount of caps I won't even bother continuing this pointless conversation, let alone searching for something.}
{2250}{}{对于这么多的大写字母，我甚至不想继续这种毫无意义的对话，更不用说寻找什么了。}
#{2251}{}{Fine, twice the amount?}
{2251}{}{好吧，两倍的数量？}
#{2252}{}{Fine, three times the amount?}
{2252}{}{好吧，三倍的数量？}
#{2253}{}{Your loss. I'll find another way how to get those things.}
{2253}{}{你的损失。我会找到另一种方法得到这些东西。}
#{2300}{}{Well, let's say for such... a donation I could look around. Show me the caps and we can talk more.}
{2300}{}{好吧，就这么说吧。。。我可以四处看看。把瓶盖给我看看，我们可以多谈谈。}
#{2301}{}{Here are 60 caps, and now I want the things that belonged to the previous doctor.}
{2301}{}{这是60顶瓶盖，现在我要的是以前医生的东西。}
#{2302}{}{Damn, I don't have caps right now, but I'll get them...}
{2302}{}{妈的，我现在没有瓶盖，但我会去拿的。。。}
#{2350}{}{You still haven't convinced me talking to you is worth it.}
{2350}{}{你还没说服我跟你说话是值得的。}
#{2351}{}{You still haven't convinced me talking to you is worth it.}
{2351}{}{你还没说服我跟你说话是值得的。}
#{2352}{}{Fine, 60 caps then, but that's my last offer.}
{2352}{}{好吧，那就60杯，但这是我最后的报价了。}
#{2353}{}{Your loss. I'll find another way how to get those things.}
{2353}{}{你的损失。我会找到另一种方法得到这些东西。}
#{2400}{}{And what the hell do you want it for?}
{2400}{}{你到底想要它干什么？}
#{2401}{}{I'm helping her father cast light on her death. I'm searching for the true murderer.}
{2401}{}{我在帮助她父亲揭露她的死因。我在寻找真正的凶手。}
#{2402}{}{None of your business. You have the caps, so give me the stuff and don't worry about it.}
{2402}{}{不关你的事。你有瓶盖，把东西给我，别担心。}
#{2450}{}{You really think you can single-handedly resolve what destroyed this city? If you think so... [He puts his hand into a cabinet and after a while of searching pulls out an old leather bag filled with junk.] Here you go.}
{2450}{}{你真的认为你能单枪匹马解决摧毁这座城市的问题吗？如果你这么认为。。。[他把手伸进一个柜子，找了一会儿，拿出一个装满垃圾的旧皮包]给你。}
#{2451}{}{Thanks, doc.}
{2451}{}{谢谢，医生。}
#{2452}{}{You really think you can single-handedly resolve what destroyed this city? If you think so... [He puts his hand into a cabinet and after a while of searching he just shrugs.] I probably threw it out. Nothing here.}
{2452}{}{你真的认为你能单枪匹马解决摧毁这座城市的问题吗？如果你这么认为。。。[他把手伸进一个柜子，搜了一会儿就耸耸肩]我可能把它扔了。这里什么都没有。}
#{2453}{}{Damn, what a pity, but thanks anyway, doc.}
{2453}{}{妈的，真遗憾，不过还是谢谢你，医生。}
#{2500}{}{Hmm, I don't know if I should give it to you... But oh well. [He puts his hand into a cabinet and after a while of searching pulls out an old leather bag filled with junk.] Here you go.}
{2500}{}{嗯，我不知道该不该给你。。。但是哦，好吧。[他把手伸进一个柜子，找了一会儿，拿出一个装满垃圾的旧皮包]给你。}
#{2501}{}{Thanks, doc. Expensive, but hopefully it'll help me.}
{2501}{}{谢谢，医生。很贵，但希望对我有帮助。}
#{2502}{}{Hmm, I don't know if I should give it to you... But oh well. [He puts his hand into a cabinet and after a while of searching just shrugs.] I probably threw it out. Nothing here. Bummer.}
{2502}{}{嗯，我不知道该不该给你。。。但是哦，好吧。[他把手伸进一个柜子，找了一会儿就耸了耸肩]我可能把它扔了。这里什么都没有。真倒霉。}
#{2503}{}{Goddamn, doc! So I paid for nothing?! I have to go and calm down.}
{2503}{}{该死，医生！所以我什么都没付？！我得去冷静一下。}
#{2504}{}{Goddamn, doc! So I paid for nothing?! I have to go and calm down.}
{2504}{}{该死，医生！所以我什么都没付？！我得去冷静一下。}
#{2550}{}{Her death? Why tamper with that issue and ignite it again? You won't find anything out. Let it be, you won't change anything anymore.}
{2550}{}{她的死？为什么要篡改这个问题并再次点燃它？你不会发现什么的。顺其自然吧，你不会再改变什么了。}
#{2551}{}{Maybe you're right, but I think at least her father deserves an explanation.}
{2551}{}{也许你是对的，但我认为至少她父亲应该得到一个解释。}
#{2552}{}{Maybe not, but don't you think maybe even Julian would like to know who's behind her death?}
{2552}{}{也许不是，但你不觉得连朱利安都想知道谁是她死的幕后黑手吗？}
#{2600}{}{Hey, I don't know him much and honestly, I don't care. Go bother someone else with it.}
{2600}{}{嘿，我不太了解他，老实说，我不在乎。去用它麻烦别人吧。}
#{2601}{}{Ah, I see where this is going. What about something else than compassion for motivation?}
{2601}{}{啊，我明白了。除了对动机的同情之外，还有什么别的呢？}
#{2602}{}{Ah, I see where this is going. What about something else than compassion for motivation?}
{2602}{}{啊，我明白了。除了对动机的同情之外，还有什么别的呢？}
#{2603}{}{Well, as you wish, I'm on my way.}
{2603}{}{好吧，如你所愿，我马上就来。}
#{2700}{}{Hmm. Maybe yes. But what's in it for me?}
{2700}{}{嗯。也许是的。但这对我有什么好处？}
#{2701}{}{Ah, I finally see your point. Let's not linger anymore - would a small motivation help with your decision?}
{2701}{}{啊，我终于明白你的意思了。让我们不要再逗留了-一个小的动机会帮助你的决定吗？}
#{2702}{}{When I'm explaining everything to him, I won't forget to give you credit.}
{2702}{}{当我向他解释一切的时候，我不会忘记给你一点信任。}
#{2800}{}{I don't think it would help me in any way. This city'll be as miserable for everyone as before.}
{2800}{}{我不认为这对我有任何帮助。这个城市对每个人来说都会像以前一样悲惨。}
#{2801}{}{Ah, I finally see your point. Let's not linger anymore - would a small motivation help with your decision?}
{2801}{}{啊，我终于明白你的意思了。让我们不要再逗留了-一个小的动机会帮助你的决定吗？}
#{2802}{}{And what if it will? If Julian's theory about Leonard's guilt proves true, he'll try to get him even more and one day he'll surely succeed. Your people will take over the entire city and everybody moves up, no?}
{2802}{}{如果会呢？如果朱利安关于伦纳德有罪的理论被证明是真的，他会努力让他更有罪，总有一天他会成功的。你的人会占领整个城市，所有人都会上楼，不是吗？}
#{2850}{}{Well, I haven't thought about that. But Julian has wanted to get Leonard since dawn of time, yet no luck so far. I don't think this could help.}
{2850}{}{嗯，我没想过。但朱利安从黎明起就想得到伦纳德，但至今还没有什么好运气。我觉得这没用。}
#{2851}{}{When it comes to women, people are capable of doing many things... I have heard a lot of such stories.}
{2851}{}{说到女人，人们可以做很多事情。。。我听过很多这样的故事。}
#{2852}{}{Alright. I see I won't convince you. What about... a bit of a different motivation then?}
{2852}{}{好吧。我知道我不能说服你。那。。。有点不同的动机吗？}
#{2853}{}{When it comes to women, people are capable of doing many things... I have heard a lot of such stories.}
{2853}{}{说到女人，人们可以做很多事情。。。我听过很多这样的故事。}
#{2900}{}{Well, there could be something about it.. Okay, fine. I'll give you the stuff. At least I'll get rid of you. [He puts his hand into a cabinet and after a while of searching pulls out an old leather bag filled with junk.]}
{2900}{}{好吧，可能有点。。好吧，好吧。我把东西给你。至少我会摆脱你。[他把手伸进一个柜子，找了一会儿，拿出一个装满垃圾的旧皮包。]}
#{2901}{}{Thanks, doc. You'll see it's for a good thing.}
{2901}{}{谢谢，医生。你会发现这是件好事。}
#{2902}{}{Well, there could be something about it.. Okay, fine. I'll give you the stuff. At least I'll get rid of you. [He puts his hand into a cabinet and after a while of searching just shrugs.] I probably threw it out. Nothing here. Bummer.}
{2902}{}{好吧，可能有点。。好吧，好吧。我把东西给你。至少我会摆脱你。[他把手伸进一个柜子，找了一会儿就耸了耸肩]我可能把它扔了。这里什么都没有。真倒霉。}
#{2903}{}{Damn! Oh well, I'll try to get the evidence somewhere else.}
{2903}{}{该死！哦，好吧，我去别处找证据。}
#{2950}{}{Lemme see, I'll have a look. Hm, fine, I'll tell you, but it won't be for free. I want 10 caps.}
{2950}{}{让我看看，我去看看。嗯，好吧，我告诉你，但这不是免费的。我要10个瓶盖。}
#{2951}{}{OK, there we go.}
{2951}{}{好了，开始了。}
#{2952}{}{I don't have that much on me, I'll be back later.}
{2952}{}{我身上没带那么多东西，我一会儿回来。}
#{2953}{}{Bah! Stuff it, geezer!}
{2953}{}{呸！算了吧，老头子！}
#{3000}{}{Well, basically, here it's written Maria had already been dead when someone stabbed her. Apparently she was poisoned by some potent poison. I hope this makes sense to you.}
{3000}{}{好吧，基本上，这里写着玛丽亚已经死了，当有人刺伤她。显然她是被某种烈性毒药毒死的。我希望这对你有意义。}
#{3001}{}{Thanks, doc. You helped me a lot!}
{3001}{}{谢谢，医生。你帮了我很多！}
#{3050}{}{Okay, let them lay here, we can begin then...}
{3050}{}{好吧，让他们躺在这里，我们可以开始了。。。}
#{3051}{}{[Let him do his job.]}
{3051}{}{[让他做他的工作。]}
#{3100}{}{Do you really think I'll cure some mangy, dirty mutt? Get out and take him with you!}
{3100}{}{你真的认为我能治好一些脏兮兮的狗吗？出去把他带走！}
#{3101}{}{[Leave.]}
{3101}{}{[离开]}
#{3150}{}{Damn! You're completely okay! Don't stay in the way and get out!}
{3150}{}{该死！你完全没事！别挡着路出去！}
#{3151}{}{[Leave.]}
{3151}{}{[离开]}
