#{100}{}{You see Eric.}
{100}{}{你看到埃里克了。}
#{101}{}{You see a slave named Eric.}
{101}{}{你看到一个叫埃里克的奴隶。}
#{102}{}{What a waste. He shouldn't have taken such a risk for me.}
{102}{}{真是浪费。他不该为我冒这么大的风险。}
#{103}{}{Thanks, wanderer, we will never forget it!}
{103}{}{谢谢，流浪汉，我们永远不会忘记的！}
#{110}{}{Sorry, I've gotta get the hell out of here, right now.}
{110}{}{抱歉，我得马上离开这里。}
#{111}{}{What?}
{111}{}{什么？}
#{112}{}{Who are you?}
{112}{}{你是谁？}
#{113}{}{How did you get here?}
{113}{}{你怎么来的？}
#{114}{}{You know how to get out of here?}
{114}{}{你知道怎么离开这里吗？}
#{115}{}{Eric, I have a letter from your brother.}
{115}{}{埃里克，我有你哥哥的信。}
#{116}{}{Eric, you can get out of here now - the slavers are dead.}
{116}{}{埃里克，你现在可以离开这里了-奴隶主已经死了。}
#{117}{}{Nothing.}
{117}{}{没有什么。}
#{118}{}{Damn right! We have to get out of here, right now! Let17s go!}
{118}{}{他妈的对！我们必须马上离开这里！我们走吧！}
#{119}{}{Be careful there.}
{119}{}{小心点。}
#{120}{}{My name is Eric. Before getting here I was just a laborer in this city of sins.}
{120}{}{我叫埃里克。在来到这里之前，我只是这个罪恶之城的一名劳工。}
#{121}{}{Right.}
{121}{}{正确的。}
#{122}{}{It is hardly possible. Patrols guard all the exits and the lobby is always full of people. Just open the gate and the slavers will immediately grab their weapons.}
{122}{}{这几乎不可能。巡逻队守卫着所有的出口，大厅里总是挤满了人。只要打开大门，奴隶贩子们就会立刻拿起他们的武器。}
#{123}{}{The postman brought me. He-he. I actually lost everything in the casino, and the owners, instead of shaking me out for debt, just sold me into slavery. It was the biggest mistake of my life. I won17t ever count on luck again.}
{123}{}{邮递员把我带来了。他，他。实际上，我在赌场里失去了一切，赌场的老板非但没有把我赶走还债，反而把我卖了当奴隶。这是我一生中最大的错误。我再也不会指望运气了。}
#{124}{}{Really?!}
{124}{}{真正地？！}
#{125}{}{Yes, here it is.}
{125}{}{是的，在这儿。}
#{126}{}{I lost it somewhere, but I remember it by letter.}
{126}{}{我把它丢在什么地方了，但我记得它是用字母写的。}
#{127}{}{Damn, I lost it somewhere. I'll go look for it.}
{127}{}{该死，我把它丢在什么地方了。我去找找。}
#{128}{}{I find it hard to believe someone was able to go to the slave pens just to bring me a letter from my brother. Hell, playing with the feelings of the person in distress tells a lot about the one doing it.}
{128}{}{我发现很难相信有人能去奴隶收容所仅仅是为了给我带来我哥哥的一封信。见鬼，玩弄受难者的感情，能告诉你很多事情。}
#{129}{}{I'm telling the truth!}
{129}{}{我说的是实话！}
#{130}{}{Yeah, right.}
{130}{}{是的，没错。}
#{131}{}{Ugh...}
{131}{}{呃。。。}
#{132}{}{My God! [reads the letter, then reads again] He's crazy! Damn, he just won't do it. Two guards with guns will be watching me... In any case, thank you for this. Tell him that I don't like the idea.}
{132}{}{天哪！他疯了！该死，他就是不干。两个持枪的守卫会看着我。。。无论如何，谢谢你。告诉他我不喜欢这个主意。}
#{133}{}{Whatever you say.}
{133}{}{不管你说什么。}
#{134}{}{Have you heard anything interesting from the slavers?}
{134}{}{你从奴隶主那里听到什么有趣的消息了吗？}
#{135}{}{Well, some of the guards have been talking, saying, the city has a secret laboratory, where slaves are used for experiments. I wouldn17t want to end up there. Although, probably slaves like me will be sent to fight in the ring.}
{135}{}{好吧，有些卫兵一直在说，这个城市有一个秘密实验室，在那里奴隶被用来做实验。我不想在那里结束。不过，像我这样的奴隶可能会被派去拳击场打仗。}
#{1103}{}{Thanks, wanderer, we will never forget it!}
{1103}{}{谢谢，流浪汉，我们永远不会忘记的！}
