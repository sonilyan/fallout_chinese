{200}{}{（一个衣冠不整的男人悲伤地看着你）你好，陌生人。我想马上说，我没有任何价值。}
### {1200}{}{(a disheveled man looks at you with a sad look) Hello, stranger. I want to say right away that I have nothing of value.}
{1200}{}{（一个衣冠不整的男人悲伤地看着你）你好，陌生人。我想马上说，我没有任何价值。}
### {201}{}{That's what everyone says. Show me what you're hiding.}
{201}{}{每个人都这么说。让我看看你在藏什么。}
### {202}{}{I'm telling you, there's nothing. The Raiders kicked me out of my own house. I am a beggar and homeless.}
{202}{}{我告诉你，什么都没有。突袭者把我赶出了自己的房子。我是个乞丐，无家可归。}
### {203}{}{Ugh, it's disgusting to even look at you.}
{203}{}{啊，看着你真恶心。}
### {204}{}{Sorry to hear that. But I need to talk to you.}
{204}{}{很抱歉听到这个消息。但我需要和你谈谈。}
### {205}{}{I see you're on edge. Calm down, I'm not going to rob you.}
{205}{}{我看你很紧张。冷静点，我不会抢你的。}
### {206}{}{Sorry. I lost my trust in people after the raiders kicked me out of the farm. Now I'm a beggar and homeless, as you can see.}
{206}{}{很抱歉袭击者把我赶出农场后，我失去了对人们的信任。现在我成了一个乞丐，无家可归，正如你所看到的。}
### {207}{}{Sorry to hear that. Do you mind if I sit next to you?}
{207}{}{很抱歉听到这个消息。你介意我坐在你旁边吗？}
### {208}{}{So I don't need you. Sit on with your sorrows, loser.}
{208}{}{所以我不需要你。继续悲伤吧，失败者。}
### {209}{}{Clearly, there are no more questions.}
{209}{}{显然，没有更多的问题了。}
### {210}{}{Yes?}
{210}{}{对}
### {211}{}{Nothing yet.}
{211}{}{还没有。}
### {212}{}{Who are you?}
{212}{}{你是谁？}
### {213}{}{I'm Randy. He arrived with the colonists a few years ago and set up his small farm away from everyone. It is unlikely that you will be interested in the rest of my biography.}
{213}{}{我叫Randy。几年前，他和殖民者一起来到这里，在远离所有人的地方建立了他的小农场。你不大可能对我传记的其余部分感兴趣。}
### {214}{}{Did the raiders kick you out of the house?}
{214}{}{袭击者把你赶出家门了吗？}
### {215}{}{Yeah, these smart-ass guys know how to ambush. I was in their hands faster than I could say "mole rat". They turned over the whole house while looking for food. And then they threw me out into the open sky. And they said I don't live here anymore.}
{215}{}{是的，这些聪明的家伙知道如何伏击。我在他们手里的速度比我说的“鼹鼠”还要快。他们在找食物时把整个房子翻了个遍。然后他们把我扔到了开阔的天空。他们说我不再住在这里了。}
### {216}{}{Have you tried to kick them out of there?}
{216}{}{你有没有试着把他们踢出去？}
### {217}{}{One against three armed raiders is too much. It's better to lose your home than to lose your life.}
{217}{}{一对三武装袭击者太过分了。失去家总比失去生命好。}
### {218}{}{Why not ask the garrison for help?}
{218}{}{为什么不向驻军寻求帮助呢？}
### {219}{}{Because then I will have to give them almost all of my harvest for ten years. Such are the conditions. And my farm can only feed a couple of people, no more.}
{219}{}{因为到那时，我将不得不把我十年来几乎所有的收成都给他们。这就是条件。我的农场只能养活几个人，再也不能养活了。}
### {220}{}{I will solve the problem with the raiders if you give me your food.}
{220}{}{如果你给我你的食物，我会解决袭击者的问题。}
### {221}{}{Our problems are somewhat similar. I want to help you.}
{221}{}{我们的问题有些相似。我想帮助你。}
### {222}{}{Tell me about yourself.}
{222}{}{告诉我你自己。}
### {223}{}{Did the Raiders kick you out of the house?}

{224}{}{是的，当然。农场里有少量的食物供应。他们无论如何都会找到某人。但对我来说不是。}
### {225}{}{Lead the way.}
{225}{}{带路。}
### {226}{}{Tempting offer, but I don't want to mess with the raiders.}
{226}{}{诱人的报价，但我不想惹上袭击者。}
### {227}{}{Will you drive them away? That would be very helpful. I hope you know how to fight, because it's hardly possible to negotiate with them.}
{227}{}{你会把他们赶走吗？那将非常有帮助。我希望你知道如何战斗，因为几乎不可能与他们谈判。}
### {228}{}{I'll find a way. Just show me the way.}
{228}{}{我会想办法的。只要给我指路就行了。}
### {229}{}{Indeed, it is too dangerous for one person. Sorry, I can't help.}
{229}{}{事实上，这对一个人来说太危险了。对不起，我帮不了你。}

### {310}{}{Is this your farm?}

### {311}{}{Sure. This is my house and my garden beds.}
{311}{}{当然这是我的房子和花园里的床。}
### {312}{}{Do you live here alone?}
{312}{}{你一个人住在这里吗？}
### {313}{}{Yes, recently. At first there were more of us, and everyone worked for the farm. One was killed by thieves for the harvest, the other died of some kind of infection. So gradually I was left alone. But I still don't want to leave here.}
{313}{}{是的，最近。起初，我们有更多的人，每个人都为农场工作。一个是为了收割被小偷杀死的，另一个死于某种感染。渐渐地，我一个人孤零零的。但我还是不想离开这里。}
### {314}{}{Why is this farm so important to you? There are lots of abandoned lands and houses all around.}
{314}{}{为什么这个农场对你如此重要？周围有许多废弃的土地和房屋。}
### {315}{}{This land has become fruitful only thanks to our sweat and our blood! I put in too much work to give it to some robbers. They're going to leave some day anyway.}
{315}{}{这片土地因为我们的汗水和鲜血而硕果累累！我付出了太多的努力才把它交给一些强盗。他们总有一天会离开的。}
### {316}{}{And why is there a sign at the entrance "Morrison brothers"?}
{316}{}{为什么入口处有“莫里森兄弟”的标志？}
### {317}{}{( confused) Morrison... No matter. This sign is probably a hundred years old. Now *I* own this land!}
{317}{}{（困惑）莫里森。。。不管怎样这个标志可能有一百年的历史了。现在我拥有这片土地！}
### {318}{}{What do you know about the invaders?}
{318}{}{你对入侵者了解多少？}
### {319}{}{They lived here before us. Savages, that is. They did not adapt to the new life, but they learned to rob. The garrisons took out almost everyone, but this gang turned out to be too tenacious.}
{319}{}{他们在我们之前就住在这里。就是野蛮人。他们不适应新的生活，但他们学会了抢劫。守军几乎干掉了所有人，但这帮人太顽强了。}
### {320}{}{You didn't talk about it.}
{320}{}{你没有谈论它。}
### {321}{}{And why? Look, they're just raiders. They come and take what doesn't belong to them. Nothing else matters.}
{321}{}{为什么？看，他们只是袭击者。他们来拿走不属于他们的东西。其他什么都不重要。}

### {350}{}{The invaders are dead, Randy. You can go back to your sweet home.}
{350}{}{入侵者已经死了，Randy。你可以回到你甜蜜的家了。}
### {351}{}{I can't believe you did it. Eh, I could use your skills... Maybe you'll move in with me for good, huh?}
{351}{}{真不敢相信你居然这么做了。呃，我可以用你的技术。。。也许你会永远和我一起住，是吗？}
### {352}{}{Can't. I have a house too. And he's in danger.}
{352}{}{不能我也有房子。他处于危险之中。}
### {353}{}{Into this hole? Well, no. There are plantations in my native village that you never dreamed of.}
{353}{}{进这个洞？嗯，没有。在我的家乡有一些种植园，你做梦也想不到。}
### {354}{}{Well, if that's the case... I understand. Thank you for your help and good luck.}
{354}{}{如果是这样的话。。。我理解。谢谢你的帮助和好运。}
### {355}{}{Not so fast. Give all the food you have.}
{355}{}{没那么快。把你所有的食物都给我。}
### {356}{}{Glad to help.}
{356}{}{很乐意帮忙。}
### {1356}{}{I was glad to help.}
{1356}{}{我很乐意帮忙。}
### {357}{}{Ah, of course. Some invaders pushed others. Nothing changes, right? You can take everything that was left in that refrigerator.}
{357}{}{啊，当然。一些入侵者推搡其他人。没有什么变化，对吧？你可以拿走冰箱里剩下的所有东西。}
### {358}{}{That would be right away.}
{358}{}{那就马上。}
### {359}{}{These savages won't bother you anymore. You can go back to your house.}
{359}{}{这些野蛮人不会再打扰你了。你可以回家了。}
