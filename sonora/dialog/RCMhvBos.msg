### {100}{}{Here is a bandit.}
{100}{}{这是一个土匪。}
### {101}{}{You see a man who doesn't look like a ranger at all.}
{101}{}{你看到一个看起来一点也不像护林员的人。}

{102}{}{在我开枪之前离开这里。}

#The first dialog
### {200}{}{Wait. You're in Ranger land. And I don't like it. What are you doing in our domain?}
{200}{}{等待你在游骑兵的土地上。我不喜欢。你在我们的领域做什么？}
### {201}{}{What are you talking about? The land is nobody's land. Only robbers appropriate the common property to themselves.}
{201}{}{你在说什么？这片土地是无人的土地。只有强盗才会把共同财产据为己有。}
### {202}{}{An interesting point of view. And completely meaningless. But I asked the question - WHAT are you doing here?}
{202}{}{一个有趣的观点。而且完全没有意义。但我问了一个问题――你在这里干什么？}
### {203}{}{Maybe I'm looking for you. They say you rob travelers under the guise of a ranger.}
{203}{}{也许我在找你。他们说你打着护林员的幌子抢劫旅行者。}
### {204}{}{I am a ranger, here is my badge. And I'm not robbing anyone. It happens that I take something as a fee for crossing the border. This is my job. By the way, you will also have to pay.}
{204}{}{我是一名护林员，这是我的徽章。我不会抢劫任何人。碰巧我带了一些东西作为过境费。这是我的工作。顺便说一下，你还得付钱。}
### {205}{}{Is this your territory? You're lying. Prove it.}
{205}{}{这是你的地盘吗？你在撒谎。证明它。}
### {206}{}{You're a simple robber.}
{206}{}{你是个简单的强盗。}

### {210}{}{Did the heat of the desert heat your brains? You're not in a position to demand anything. Give everything you have and you can go.}
{210}{}{沙漠的高温加热了你的大脑吗？你不能要求任何东西。付出你所拥有的一切，你就可以离开。}
### {211}{}{OK, I'll give it all, just don't hit me.}
{211}{}{好吧，我会全力以赴，只是不要打我。}
### {212}{}{And now get out so I don't see you here.}
{212}{}{现在滚出去，这样我就不会在这里看到你了。}
### {213}{}{As you say...}
{213}{}{正如你所说。。。}
### {214}{}{Hey, give me my stuff! Immediately.}
{214}{}{嘿，把我的东西给我！立即}
### {215}{}{I'm not giving you anything.}
{215}{}{我什么都不给你。}
### {216}{}{It's worse for you. Guys, you know what to do...}
{216}{}{这对你来说更糟。伙计们，你们知道该怎么办。。。}
### {217}{}{Everyone stop!}
{217}{}{大家停下！}
### {218}{}{OK, I'll give it all. Here, take it...}
{218}{}{好的，我会全力以赴。给，拿着。。。}
### {219}{}{These things are terribly radioactive. Do you want to make sure of this on your health?}
{219}{}{这些东西具有极强的放射性。你想确保你的健康吗？}
### {220}{}{I'm not buying these tricks. Last warning, or you're dead.}
{220}{}{我不相信这些把戏。最后一次警告，否则你就死定了。}
### {221}{}{Okay. Just be careful with these things. They are terribly radioactive.}
{221}{}{可以小心这些东西。它们具有极强的放射性。}
### {222}{}{Put it away, you idiot! Why the hell do you carry such stuff with you?}
{222}{}{把它收起来，你这个白痴！你为什么带着这样的东西？}
### {223}{}{Just in case.}
{223}{}{以防万一。}
### {224}{}{This is necessary for one case.}
{224}{}{这对于一个案例来说是必要的。}
### {225}{}{No. First I want to know who you really are. A ranger wouldn't break the rules.}
{225}{}{不。首先我想知道你到底是谁。护林员不会违反规则的。}
### {226}{}{You're not a ranger. A real ranger wouldn't break the law.}
{226}{}{你不是护林员。一个真正的护林员不会违法。}

### {230}{}{I represent the LAW. The power is in my hands, and who are you? Obey!}
{230}{}{我代表法律。权力掌握在我手中，你是谁？服从}
### {231}{}{The hell with two...}
{231}{}{有两个。。。}
### {232}{}{If you're a ranger, then you're not worthy of your badge. I'm stripping you of your rank. Give me the badge.}
{232}{}{如果你是一名护林员，那么你就配不上你的徽章。我要剥夺你的军衔。把徽章给我。}
### {233}{}{A ranger who has violated the Law is deprived of his rank. Give me the badge.}
{233}{}{违反法律的护林员被剥夺了军衔。把徽章给我。}

### {240}{}{Ha, Law and Order. These words are empty and mean nothing. The Rangers came to these lands, declared them their property and levied a tax. Just because they CAN. And why are we worse? If they rob, then we will rob.}
{240}{}{哈，法律与秩序。这些话是空洞的，毫无意义。游骑兵来到这些土地，宣布他们的财产并征税。只是因为他们可以。为什么我们更糟？如果他们抢劫，我们就会抢劫。}
### {241}{}{In exchange, residents receive protection. And besides, you can always go somewhere else.}
{241}{}{作为交换，居民得到保护。此外，你还可以去别的地方。}
### {242}{}{So are the Rangers not defending their lands?}
{242}{}{游骑兵队不是在保卫他们的土地吗？}
### {243}{}{People are social fodder for them. Do you understand? No one will risk their own skin for the sake of others. I know it. The Rangers promised us protection from bandits. But where were they when the robbers attacked my village?}
{243}{}{人们是他们的社交素材。你明白吗？没有人会为了别人而冒自己的风险。我知道，游骑兵答应保护我们不受土匪袭击。但是当强盗袭击我的村庄时，他们在哪里？}
### {244}{}{Maybe they just didn't have time?}
{244}{}{也许他们只是没有时间？}
### {245}{}{Is that supposed to make me feel better? They've been charging us a game tax for two years. We were malnourished, and they didn't care. Besides, they took all the most powerful weapons. If not for that, maybe we would have fought off the attackers.}
{245}{}{这会让我感觉好些吗？他们已经向我们收取游戏税两年了。我们营养不良，他们不在乎。此外，他们拿走了所有最强大的武器。如果不是这样，也许我们会击退袭击者。}
### {246}{}{What a sad story. You must be very angry now.}
{246}{}{多么悲伤的故事。你现在一定很生气。}
### {247}{}{Sure. And don't think I'll let you go so easily now. Take off all your things. And clothes too.}
{247}{}{当然别以为我现在会这么轻易地让你走。把你所有的东西都脱掉。还有衣服。}
### {248}{}{I have nothing to do with it. Leave me alone.}
{248}{}{我与此事无关，别管我。}
### {249}{}{Someone else's misdeeds cannot be an excuse. Give me the badge, and I'll have mercy on your miserable life.}
{249}{}{别人的不当行为不能成为借口。把徽章给我，我会宽恕你悲惨的生活。}
### {250}{}{It's horrible. But you have to forgive them.}
{250}{}{太可怕了。但你必须原谅他们。}
### {251}{}{Do you take me for an idiot? Take off your things. Slow so I can see.}
{251}{}{你以为我是白痴吗？脱下你的东西。慢一点，这样我就能看见。}
### {252}{}{It's horrible. I understand you well, because my village was also destroyed by slavers.}
{252}{}{太可怕了。我很理解你，因为我的村庄也被奴隶贩子摧毁了。}
### {253}{}{I think I've heard something about it. So you and I are both outlaws.}
{253}{}{我想我听说了一些事情。所以你和我都是亡命之徒。}
### {254}{}{Exactly. And no one will notice if I just kill you. Say goodbye to life, loser...}
{254}{}{确切地如果我杀了你，没人会注意到的。跟生活说再见，失败者。。。}
### {255}{}{I ask you - no unnecessary civilian casualties. It's not to blame for anything. You're taking revenge on the wrong people.}
{255}{}{我请求你们――不要有不必要的平民伤亡。什么都不怪它。你是在报复错误的人。}
### {256}{}{I KNOW. But what should we do? We are outlaws, we have nowhere to go.}
{256}{}{我知道。但是我们该怎么办呢？我们是亡命之徒，无处可去。}
### {257}{}{What about hunting game or protecting caravans? You can always find a legal way.}
{257}{}{狩猎游戏或保护大篷车怎么样？你总能找到合法的途径。}
### {258}{}{To hell with talking. Such a criminal cannot be persuaded...}
{258}{}{见鬼去吧。这样的罪犯是无法说服的。。。}
### {259}{}{We discussed it a lot in the gang. We have already been bullied by such a life. There are few people in these wastelands, and the risks are getting higher. It's time to decide something. A badge? Yes, take it. He's no good anyway.}
{259}{}{我们在帮派里讨论了很多。我们已经被这样的生活欺负过了。这些荒地上的人很少，而且风险越来越高。是时候做决定了。徽章？是的，拿着吧。他无论如何都不好。}
### {260}{}{This is a very wise decision. Thank you.}
{260}{}{这是一个非常明智的决定。非常感谢。}
### {261}{}{Get out before I shoot you.}
{261}{}{在我开枪之前滚出去。}
### {262}{}{I'm already leaving...}
{262}{}{我已经离开了。。。}

### {300}{}{You again? Don't you understand the first time?}
{300}{}{你又来了？你第一次不明白吗？}
### {301}{}{There is nothing to understand here. You're a simple robber. And I have a short dialogue with such people.}
{301}{}{这里没有什么可理解的。你是个简单的强盗。我与这些人进行了简短的对话。}
### {302}{}{You have no rights to this land and you can't tell me where to go.}
{302}{}{你对这片土地没有权利，也不能告诉我该去哪里。}
### {303}{}{Are you really a ranger?}
{303}{}{你真的是个护林员吗？}
