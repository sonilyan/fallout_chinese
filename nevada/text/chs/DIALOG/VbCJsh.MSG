#{100}{}{You see: Joshua.}
{100}{}{你看：约书亚。}
#{101}{}{Poor Joshua seems to have a lot of work. He's carefully analyzing data on the monitor.}
{101}{}{可怜的约书亚似乎有很多工作要做。他正在仔细分析监视器上的数据。}
#{200}{}{Hello, citizen }
{200}{}{你好，市民}
#{201}{}{. What do you want?}
{201}{}{. 你想要什么？}
#{202}{}{What is this place?}
{202}{}{这是什么地方？}
#{203}{}{What are you doing?}
{203}{}{你在做什么？}
#{204}{}{Can I use this computer?}
{204}{}{我能用这台电脑吗？}
#{205}{}{Anything else?}
{205}{}{还有别的吗？}
#{206}{}{}
{206}{}{}
#{207}{}{About that robot... }
{207}{}{关于那个机器人。。。}
#{208}{}{I found this holodisk in the west ruins, but I can't read it. Can you help?}
{208}{}{我在西部废墟里发现了这张全息光盘，但我看不懂。你能帮忙吗？}
#{209}{}{Nothing.}
{209}{}{没有什么。}
#{210}{}{Yes, we use the radio to communicate with the security patrols, so we're experienced in this field.}
{210}{}{是的，我们用无线电和安全巡逻队联系，所以我们在这方面很有经验。}
#{211}{}{Can you tell me anything about these papers from NPP "Poseidon Oil"?}
{211}{}{你能告诉我一些关于核电站“波塞冬石油”的文件吗？}
#{212}{}{Radio transmission points? Hmm... It seems that there's a radio station in the wastes that supports smaller stations by rebroadcasting their signals at higher power. That's just a theory, though. We've never gotten a signal before, just white noise. I've never seen any other reports about this. And what's stranger is that these recordings were at the Poseidon Oil power plant.}
{212}{}{无线电传输点？隐马尔可夫模型。。。似乎有一个无线电台在垃圾场，支持较小的电台转播他们的信号在更高的功率。不过，这只是个理论。我们以前从来没有收到过信号，只有白噪音。我从没见过其他关于这件事的报道。更奇怪的是，这些录音是在波塞冬石油发电厂。}
#{213}{}{What is "white noise"?}
{213}{}{什么是“白噪音”？}
#{214}{}{Can we listen to those frequencies?}
{214}{}{我们能听这些频率吗？}
#{215}{}{Can we learn the coordinates of those stations?}
{215}{}{我们能知道那些站的坐标吗？}
#{216}{}{And the second station?}
{216}{}{第二站呢？}
#{217}{}{It's to the south-east. I'll mark the coordinates on your Pip-Boy.}
{217}{}{在东南方向。我会在你的皮普小子身上标出坐标。}
#{218}{}{Hmm, that's where Cheyenne is located. Maybe they can show me where the station is.}
{218}{}{嗯，夏延就在那里。也许他们能告诉我车站在哪里。}
#{219}{}{Thanks. I'll take it from here.}
{219}{}{谢谢。我从这里开始。}
#{220}{}{It's nothing. Just background noise on the radio.}
{220}{}{没什么。只是收音机里的背景噪音。}
#{221}{}{Our station isn't strong enough. It has range about a couple of miles. We'll need a more powerful station.}
{221}{}{我们的车站不够坚固。它的射程大约有几英里。我们需要一个更强大的空间站。}
#{222}{}{Oh, I... Shouldn't have said that. I was told not to tell that to common citizens. But I guess you're an exception, right?}
{222}{}{哦，我。。。我不该那么说。我被告知不要告诉普通公民。但我想你是个例外，对吧？}
#{223}{}{Sure, you can trust me.}
{223}{}{当然，你可以相信我。}
#{224}{}{Then you'll have to wait while I study the signal.}
{224}{}{那你得等我研究信号。}
#{225}{}{Sure. You're the scientific expert here.}
{225}{}{当然。你是这里的科学专家。}
#{226}{}{Then no. I'll try to figure it out myself.}
{226}{}{那不行，我自己想办法。}
#{227}{}{Here's what I've got. With some of our system data I managed to find the coordinates of the supporting stations, but two of them are too far away to reach. One is located at NPP, probably so it can use the plant's power.}
{227}{}{这是我得到的。利用我们的一些系统数据，我设法找到了支持站的坐标，但其中两个太远了，够不着。其中一个位于核电站，可能是为了利用核电站的电力。}
#{228}{}{No, no-no-no-no. That's strictly forbidden by our unit supervisor.}
{228}{}{不，不，不，不。这是我们单位主管严格禁止的。}
#{229}{}{I saved your ass, remember?}
{229}{}{我救了你，记得吗？}
#{230}{}{Fine, I won't force you to it.}
{230}{}{好吧，我不会强迫你的。}
#{231}{}{Aw, jeez... Fine, just this time. I've already broke the law once. Oh, this is going to haunt me...}
{231}{}{噢，天哪。。。好吧，就这一次。我已经犯法一次了。哦，这会困扰我的。。。}
#{232}{}{Don't worry, I'll be careful.}
{232}{}{别担心，我会小心的。}
#{233}{}{Joshua showed you the coordinates of a previously unknown location in the South-East.}
{233}{}{约书亚给你看了东南部一个未知地点的坐标。}
#{250}{}{This is the technical service office. We maintain electronic equipment.}
{250}{}{这是技术服务办公室。我们维护电子设备。}
#{251}{}{Right.}
{251}{}{正确的。}
#{252}{}{Right now I'm monitoring the scouting robots.}
{252}{}{现在我在监视侦察机器人。}
#{253}{}{What kind of robots do you use?}
{253}{}{你用什么样的机器人？}
#{254}{}{What are scouting robots used for?}
{254}{}{侦察机器人的用途是什么？}
#{255}{}{They won't work without you?}
{255}{}{没有你他们就不能工作？}
#{256}{}{Is that difficult?}
{256}{}{很难吗？}
#{257}{}{Everything running smoothly?}
{257}{}{一切顺利吗？}
#{258}{}{Self-guiding, multi-functional systems, from flying scouts to heavy duty mining ones. Every one is irreplaceable, and we never have enough of them, so they're in constant use. Still, the work's being done very slowly.}
{258}{}{自引导，多功能系统，从飞行侦察到重型采矿。每一个都是不可替代的，我们从来没有足够的，所以他们在不断地使用。不过，这项工作进展非常缓慢。}
#{259}{}{Mostly, the scouting robots are used to study the topography, seismography, and radioactivity of the surrounding areas.}
{259}{}{侦察机器人主要用于研究周围地区的地形、地震和放射性。}
#{260}{}{Uh, yes and no. They have complex A.I. systems, but they need a human controller in case of unexpected situations.}
{260}{}{嗯，是的，也不是。他们有复杂的人工智能系统，但他们需要一个人工控制器以防意外情况。}
#{261}{}{It depends on the task. Sometimes it can be very difficult. But I wouldn't rely just on robots. They need a human telling them what to do. Without that, they're just useless machines.}
{261}{}{这取决于任务。有时会很困难。但我不会仅仅依靠机器人。他们需要一个人来告诉他们该怎么做。没有这些，它们只是无用的机器。}
#{262}{}{My supervisor wouldn't allow it. Even if he would, to do that I'd have to pull a huge amount of data off the server. None of us can spare that kind of time.}
{262}{}{我的上司不允许。即使他愿意，我也得从服务器上提取大量数据。我们谁也抽不出那样的时间。}
#{263}{}{Can I see the scouting reports?}
{263}{}{我能看看侦察报告吗？}
#{264}{}{Uh... [glances at a monitor with one red flashing light] W-we manage.}
{264}{}{休斯敦大学。。。[瞥了一眼有一个红色闪光灯的监视器]我们管理。}
#{265}{}{Really? Because that indicator says "Robot's not responding"!}
{265}{}{真正地？因为那个指示器显示“机器人没有反应”！}
#{266}{}{Woah-woah-woah, just - just keep it down, okay? I'll bring him back, okay? I can fix this, just... Don't tell my supervisor, alright?}
{266}{}{喔喔喔喔，小声点，好吗？我会带他回来的，好吗？我可以解决这个，只是。。。别告诉我的上司，好吗？}
#{267}{}{Wait just a second. What are you talking about?}
{267}{}{等一下。你在说什么？}
#{268}{}{Wait, what is it?}
{268}{}{等等，是什么？}
#{269}{}{I won't tell anyone. Just calm down and tell me what's happening.}
{269}{}{我不会告诉任何人。冷静下来告诉我发生了什么事。}
#{270}{}{Okay, so... I lost track of one of the robots doing research in the ruins, and now it's not responding. If my supervisor finds out, he's going to nail me to the wall. If I just knew what went wrong, or could get that information back, then maybe I can dodge the worst of it.}
{270}{}{好吧，那么。。。我找不到一个机器人在废墟里做研究，现在它没有反应。如果我的主管发现了，他会把我钉在墙上的。如果我知道出了什么问题，或者我能把信息拿回来，那么也许我能躲过最坏的情况。}
#{271}{}{You know, that's just the sort of problem I'm here to solve. Just ask, and I can make your problem go away!}
{271}{}{你知道，这正是我要解决的问题。只要问问，我就能解决你的问题！}
#{272}{}{I'll find your robot, if you give me something for it.}
{272}{}{如果你给我东西，我会找到你的机器人。}
#{273}{}{Wow, sounds like you really need some help. Well, see ya.}
{273}{}{哇，听起来你真的需要帮助。好吧，再见。}
#{274}{}{Oh, yes please, thank you! It got lost somewhere around the west ruins. I'd have snuck out myself, but... It's dangerous there.}
{274}{}{哦，好的，谢谢！它在西废墟附近的某个地方丢失了。我本想自己溜出去的，但是。。。那里很危险。}
#{275}{}{Don't worry about me, I'll handle it.}
{275}{}{别担心我，我会处理的。}
#{276}{}{Something? Like what? I don't have anything... Wait, I have this water flask! Please, help me!}
{276}{}{什么？像什么？我什么都没有。。。等等，我有这个水瓶！拜托，帮帮我！}
#{277}{}{Okay, deal. I'll do it.}
{277}{}{好吧，成交。我会的。}
#{278}{}{That's it? Do it yourself, I'm out of here.}
{278}{}{就这样？你自己动手，我走了。}
#{279}{}{Thank you, }
{279}{}{谢谢您，}
#{280}{}{! You're really helping me out here. Just don't say anything to my superiors, or I'm toasted.}
{280}{}{! 你真的在帮我。别跟我的上级说什么，否则我就要被烤了。}
#{281}{}{I'll remember that... Anyway, I've got to go.}
{281}{}{我会记住。。。不管怎样，我得走了。}
#{282}{}{Of course, don't worry. No one will ever find out.}
{282}{}{当然，别担心。没人会发现的。}
#{289}{}{Not yet.}
{289}{}{还没有。}
#{290}{}{Did you find the robot yet?!}
{290}{}{你找到机器人了吗？！}
#{291}{}{Where did you lose contact with it?}
{291}{}{你在哪里失去联系的？}
#{292}{}{Go outside and up the street to the "Dangerous Area" sign. There'll be a guard standing there. Turn west and you'll be in the ruins.}
{292}{}{到外面，沿着街道走到“危险区域”的标志处。会有一个守卫站在那里。往西拐，你就在废墟里了。}
#{293}{}{That's all.}
{293}{}{这就是全部。}
#{294}{}{I found the robot. The data's on this holodisk. Here, take it.}
{294}{}{我找到了机器人。数据在这个全息磁盘上。来，拿着。}
#{295}{}{I found the robot this holodisk, but are you going to give me something for it?}
{295}{}{我在这张全息光盘上找到了机器人，但你能给我点东西吗？}
#{296}{}{Oh, thank you }
{296}{}{哦，谢谢你}
#{297}{}{! This is exactly what I need. You've really saved my ass!}
{297}{}{! 这正是我需要的。你真的救了我！}
#{298}{}{Okay, I have some more questions.}
{298}{}{好吧，我还有一些问题。}
#{299}{}{Take care, Joshua.}
{299}{}{保重，乔舒亚。}
#{300}{}{What is it? A story from the wastes? How interesting! Wait here while I try to load them onto the computer.}
{300}{}{它是什么？废物的故事？多有趣啊！在这儿等着，我正试着把它们装到电脑上。}
#{301}{}{Go on, try. This is very interesting.}
{301}{}{去吧，试试。这很有趣。}
#{302}{}{I don't have time for this.}
{302}{}{我没时间做这个。}
#{303}{}{Yes! [pumps his fist in the air] I did it!}
{303}{}{对！我做到了！}
#{304}{}{What's on there? Show me!}
{304}{}{上面是什么？向我展示！}
#{305}{}{These notes were encrypted. I had to go digging through some old archives to find the right code. I saved the decrypted file to the holodisk so you can read it.}
{305}{}{这些笔记是加密的。为了找到正确的代码，我不得不翻阅一些旧档案。我把解密后的文件保存到全息磁盘上，这样你就可以读了。}
#{306}{}{Great! How do I read it from the holodisk?}
{306}{}{太好了！我怎么从全息光盘上读呢？}
#{307}{}{Good, give it to me. I'll read it when I have the time.}
{307}{}{很好，给我。我有时间就看。}
#{308}{}{Easy. Select "use" on the holodisk, and the information will be copied to your Pip-Boy. Then open it and go into your notes list on the right. Select the file and read.}
{308}{}{容易的。在全息盘上选择“使用”，信息将被复制到你的Pip Boy。然后打开它，进入右边的笔记列表。选择文件并读取。}
#{309}{}{Thanks, I'll give it a try.}
{309}{}{谢谢，我试试看。}
#{310}{}{Joshua deciphered the information on the holodisk. This information should be very useful.}
{310}{}{约书亚破译了全息光盘上的信息。这些信息应该非常有用。}
#{313}{}{How could you! I trusted you!}
{313}{}{你怎么能！我信任你！}
#{330}{}{Can you decipher it? [show him the recordings from the robot]}
{330}{}{你能破译它吗？[给他看机器人的录音]}
#{331}{}{Sure, this is all pretty standard. But I'll need some time.}
{331}{}{当然，这都是很标准的。但我需要一些时间。}
#{332}{}{I'll wait. Do your thing.}
{332}{}{我会等的。做你该做的。}
#{333}{}{Then forget it. Don't waste time.}
{333}{}{那就算了吧。不要浪费时间。}
#{334}{}{That took a while. There's a lot of data in here, that robot was not well optimized.}
{334}{}{那花了一段时间。这里有很多数据，那个机器人没有得到很好的优化。}
#{335}{}{Thank you. This is what I needed.}
{335}{}{非常感谢。这就是我需要的。}
#{340}{}{I need to repair this on-board computer.}
{340}{}{我需要修理这台车载电脑。}
#{341}{}{Hmm... [carefully and even cautiously studies the unfamiliar device]}
{341}{}{隐马尔可夫模型。。。[仔细甚至谨慎地研究这个不熟悉的设备]}
#{342}{}{Uh, do you even know what that is?}
{342}{}{你知道那是什么吗？}
#{343}{}{Honestly - no. I've never seen anything like this before, but I think I can figure it out. I just need permission from my supervisor. This is going to take a while and if he sees me doing unsanctioned work, he's gonna be pissed.}
{343}{}{老实说-没有。我以前从没见过这样的事，但我想我能弄明白。我只需要得到主管的许可。这需要一段时间，如果他看到我做未经批准的工作，他会生气的。}
#{344}{}{I'll talk to your supervisor.}
{344}{}{我会和你的主管谈谈。}
#{1200}{}{Hello, citizen }
{1200}{}{你好，市民}
#{1208}{}{I found this holodisk in the west ruins, but I can't read it. Can you help?}
{1208}{}{我在西部废墟里发现了这张全息光盘，但我看不懂。你能帮忙吗？}
