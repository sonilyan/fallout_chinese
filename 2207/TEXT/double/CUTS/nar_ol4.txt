1:The new Administrator of Olympus ordered the slaves of Tartarus freed. They were provided with weapons, food rations and medicine. The communities of Radius were supplied with machinery, water filters, fertilizer, and guns.
2:Many of the former Servants perished as they lacked the necessary survival skills. Some, disillusioned with the Gods of Olympus, were driven to suicide.
3:The Olympian military did not accept this course of action. They defected from the tower and seized power in Jackals, becoming a military powerhouse in Radius.
4:Left without the means of defense, Olympus was soon pillaged by the New Jackals.
