#{206}{}{Oh, now you're feeling guilty?}
{206}{}{哦，现在你感到内疚了？}
#{207}{}{Hey, don't go soft on me now. You can still make for it, can't you?}
{207}{}{嘿，现在别对我手软。你还是可以做到的，不是吗？}
#{208}{}{As if... We both know the prohibition of physical contact... But... We just couldn't resist.}
{208}{}{犹如。。。我们都知道禁止身体接触。。。但是。。。我们就是忍不住。}
#{209}{}{How interesting. It must be a very unusual experience. Tell me about it.}
{209}{}{真有趣。这一定是一次非常不寻常的经历。告诉我吧。}
#{210}{}{I had enough of your whining. I know what to do with you people.}
{210}{}{我受够了你的抱怨。我知道怎么处理你们这些人。}
#{211}{}{We know how bad the punishment is. We tried to control ourselves! But we just... Couldn't. Maybe... Maybe we just don't belong in a normal community.}
{211}{}{我们知道惩罚有多严重。我们试图控制自己！但我们只是。。。不行。也许。。。也许我们不属于一个正常的社会。}
#{212}{}{What do you know about the prohibition of physical contact?}
{212}{}{你对禁止身体接触了解多少？}
#{213}{}{Why couldn't you control yourselves?}

#{214}{}{What did you see on each other?}
{214}{}{你们在对方身上看到了什么？}
#{215}{}{How often have you had physical contact?}

#{216}{}{How could you not realize you could have been spied on?}
{216}{}{你怎么可能不知道你可能被监视了？}
#{220}{}{[Stands at attention] As per directive 16/8 of the Vault 8 societal and personal communication rulebook, physical contact between two or more citizens for a period exceeding five seconds is forbidden. Any direct contact of naked skin or body parts is considered as physical. The violation of this rule is punishable by isolation from society for one year.}
{220}{}{[注意]根据《保险库8社会和个人通信规则手册》第16/8号指令，禁止两个或两个以上公民之间超过5秒的身体接触。任何与裸露皮肤或身体部位的直接接触都被视为身体接触。违反这一规定将被处以一年的社会隔离。}
#{221}{}{I don't know how to explain it... We are drawn to each other. We broke the rule once, by accident. And then, we wanted more and more... And in the end, we couldn't get enough! It may be some sort of contagious disease, like radiation poisoning.}
{221}{}{我不知道怎么解释。。。我们互相吸引。我们有一次不小心违反了规则。然后，我们想要越来越多。。。最后，我们还是不够！可能是某种传染病，比如辐射中毒。}
#{222}{}{It's... Strange, but under our clothes, we have... Differences. Now I understand why we must use separate showers and restrooms, and sleep in pajamas in different rooms.}
{222}{}{这是。。。奇怪，但在我们的衣服下，我们有。。。差异。现在我明白了为什么我们必须分开使用淋浴和洗手间，在不同的房间里穿着睡衣睡觉。}
#{223}{}{For the last two months, while checking the perimeter sensors. We only looked and touched! Honestly!}
{223}{}{最近两个月，在检查周边传感器的时候。我们只看了摸！说真的？}
#{224}{}{I think one of the guards suspects us, but only specific citizens can go outside the perimeter. When we leave, nobody ever followed us... Well, until now.}
{224}{}{我想其中一个警卫怀疑我们，但只有特定的公民才能走出边界。当我们离开的时候，没有人跟着我们。。。嗯，直到现在。}
#{225}{}{You'll tell the guards, and then we'll be isolated, right?}
{225}{}{你会告诉警卫，然后我们就被隔离了，对吗？}
#{226}{}{No, first I want to hear how you allowed yourselves to get to this point.}
{226}{}{不，首先我想听听你们是怎么让自己走到这一步的。}
#{227}{}{Yes, that's right.}
{227}{}{是的，没错。}
#{228}{}{No, I'm letting you go... This time. Consider yourselves warned.}
{228}{}{不，我放你走。。。这一次。你们要自以为受到了警告。}
#{229}{}{I knew this was a mistake! We have to turn ourselves in, Emily. The guards would find out about us sooner or later.}
{229}{}{我知道这是个错误！我们必须自首，艾米丽。卫兵迟早会发现我们的。}
#{230}{}{Move, I have things to do.}
{230}{}{快走，我有事要做。}
#{231}{}{Really!? You'll let us go? Emily, we're in luck! From now on, we have to be more careful...}
{231}{}{真正地！？你让我们走？埃米莉，我们很幸运！从现在开始，我们必须更加小心。。。}
#{232}{}{Exactly. The guards are always watching. Now get back to work.}
{232}{}{确切地。卫兵们一直在监视。现在回去工作吧。}
#{233}{}{That's right! And don't do anything stupid...}
{233}{}{这是正确的！别做傻事。。。}
#{1200}{}{[As soon as they see you, they immediately start putting their clothes back on] Oh, citizen! Uh... Are you allowed to be here?}
{1200}{}{[他们一看到你，马上开始穿上衣服]噢，市民！休斯敦大学。。。你被允许在这里吗？}
#{1203}{}{Quit pretending. I saw everything.}
{1203}{}{别装了。我什么都看到了。}
