{100}{}{You see: a local citizen.}
{101}{}{A wild looking fella, looks like he slept rough for the last couple of days.}
#
{102}{}{Hey, pal, new in town?}
{103}{}{How's it going?}
{104}{}{Seen any geckos around here?}
{105}{}{I'm a gecko hunter.}
{106}{}{First time here?}
{107}{}{Yup.}
#
{108}{}{I'm Mark. I hunt geckos, all kinds of them. If you are looking for some action and wanna make some money, I
 sure could use you. I know lots of places where they eat, sleep... I made a map. [Shows you his map.]}
#
{109}{}{[You look at the map... Very nice craftsmanship, it even has some detailed drawings of geckos.] That's a very
 fine map. You sure seem to know the area.}
#
{110}{}{Hey, thanks. [Rolls up the map.] You see, me and my friend Derek were explorers. Derek got a better... call it
 job, and left town. I stayed here, mostly because I wanted to help protecting the people, but since I've started hunting
 geckos I've got more than enough money to survive. Times change so fast... So, interested in some business?}
#
{111}{}{Hey, you got it. I really could use some money.}
{112}{}{Not right now, I have to finish something first.}
#
{113}{}{Greetings, stranger, I see you've returned. Have you thought about my offer?}
#
{114}{}{Yes, and I'm interested. Lets go hunt some geckos...}
{115}{}{Not yet.}
#
{116}{}{OK... When you are ready meet me on the hunting grounds north of town. I'll scout the area. See you there.}
{117}{}{Bye.}
#
{118}{}{Get ready. I'll be at the hunting tent north of here.}
# added later...
{119}{}{Hello there, can I help you with somethin', amigo?}
{120}{}{Bob told me I could find Mark here. He's one of the gecko hunters.}
{121}{}{No, you can't.}
#
{122}{}{Nice job you did there.}
{123}{}{Nice to see you.}
{124}{}{If you see any geckos around here, let me know.}
#
{125}{}{Don't bother!}
{126}{}{Leave me alone!}
{127}{}{Get lost!}
{128}{}{Beat it!}
