#Quest
### {270}{}{I'm looking for a job. Do you have any vacancies?}

### {287}{}{They were the neighborhood kids.}
{287}{}{他们是附近的孩子。}
### {288}{}{Kids? I can't believe it! Residents have always appreciated Flagstaff for its safety, because there is a garrison nearby, and there is an impassable wall of barricades around. And here's the result - the thieves were inside, not outside. Yes, and children!}
{288}{}{孩子们？我简直不敢相信！居民们一直很欣赏弗拉格斯塔夫的安全，因为附近有驻军，周围有一堵无法通行的路障墙。结果是――小偷在里面，而不是在外面。是的，还有孩子们！}

### {291}{}{They're kids. This is not theft, but a simple prank.}
{291}{}{他们是孩子。这不是盗窃，而是一个简单的恶作剧。}
### {292}{}{People with such a prank end up in correctional labor. Of course, I will not write a denunciation to the garrison, but I will not forgive the neighbors so easily.}
{292}{}{搞这种恶作剧的人最终会被关进劳教所。当然，我不会给驻军写谴责信，但我不会那么轻易地原谅邻居们。}
### {293}{}{It seems, uh, that you dropped your things yourself, I found them on the street.}
{293}{}{看起来，呃，你自己掉东西了，我在街上发现的。}
### {1293}{}{It seems, uh, that you dropped your things yourself, I found them on the street.}

### {352}{}{May I join your messengers?}
{352}{}{我可以加入你的信使吗？}
