#{118}{}{In the next two days - meet a new face among the poor...}
{118}{}{在接下来的两天里-在穷人中遇见一个新面孔...}
#{119}{}{Hey! Help me reach the New Vegas! Please!}
{119}{}{嘿！帮我到达新维加斯！拜托！}
#{120}{}{Lose your goods - and fellow caravaneers won't even look at your direction!}
{120}{}{失去你的货物-和同伴商队甚至不会看你的方向！}
#{121}{}{Or what if my pals actually reached Vegas?}
{121}{}{或者如果我的朋友真的到了维加斯呢？}
#{122}{}{Damn, I'm the most ill-fated caravaneer ever!}
{122}{}{妈的，我是有史以来最倒霉的商队队员！}
#{123}{}{It happened the first time with us!}
{123}{}{这是第一次和我们在一起！}
#{124}{}{And we were on the top in Vegas...}
{124}{}{我们在维加斯站在顶端...}
#{125}{}{Damned raiders took the most valuable stuff.}
{125}{}{该死的袭击者拿走了最值钱的东西。}
#{126}{}{I'm in dire straits. That's it. Put me right in the coffin.}

#{127}{}{And how well it all started!}
{127}{}{一切都开始得多好啊！}
#{128}{}{We even transported some thing to Salt Lake...}
{128}{}{我们甚至把一些东西运到盐湖...}
#{129}{}{Why no one wants to take me to Vegas? I'm an experienced caravaneer!}
{129}{}{为什么没人想带我去维加斯？我是个有经验的商队队员！}
#{200}{}{[You see a worried caravaneer] Uh... Hello, wanderer! I guess, you came to me for a reason but, believe me, I'm not in the right mood to help anyone.}
{200}{}{[你看到一个忧心忡忡的商队队员]呃...你好，流浪者！我想，你来找我是有原因的，但是，相信我，我没有心情去帮助任何人。}
#{201}{}{What does this mean?}
{201}{}{这是什么意思？}
#{202}{}{Sounds like it is you who need help.}
{202}{}{听起来是你需要帮助。}
#{203}{}{I only want to ask a few questions.}
{203}{}{我只想问几个问题。}

#{211}{}{Who are you?}

#{212}{}{What do you do here?}
{212}{}{你在这里做什么？}
#{213}{}{Tell me your story.}
{213}{}{告诉我你的故事。}
#{214}{}{For a second thought, I don't need anything.}
{214}{}{再想想，我什么都不需要。}
#{215}{}{My name's Bibbit. I'm a caravaneer. What else to say? Cool guy and all that, but it's just by the way.}
{215}{}{我叫毕比。我是商队的。还有什么好说的？很酷的家伙之类的，不过顺便说一下。}
#{216}{}{Licking my wounds after a tough caravan run. Wasteland appeared to be ruthless bitch this time. If not for my survival skills, I'd be already eaten by pig rats or someone even worse.}
{216}{}{在一次艰难的旅行后舔我的伤口。这次荒原似乎是个无情的婊子。如果不是因为我的生存技能，我已经被猪鼠或者更糟的人吃掉了。}
#{217}{}{I'm in big trouble, that's it. But it's a long story, as I can't do otherwise. I'll tell for a small fee... He-he. I'm joking. But I really need money. A lot.}
{217}{}{我有大麻烦了，就这样。但说来话长，我不能不这样做。我会告诉你一点费用...他，他。我在开玩笑。但我真的需要钱。很多。}
#{218}{}{If you need money then sell something.}
{218}{}{如果你需要钱，那就卖点东西。}
#{219}{}{}
{219}{}{}
#{220}{}{Well, it's not the best situation. Shit happens.}
{220}{}{嗯，这不是最好的情况。糟糕的事情发生了。}
#{221}{}{That's your problems. I'm interest in different things.}
{221}{}{那是你的问题。我对不同的事物感兴趣。}
#{222}{}{Could you elaborate?}
{222}{}{你能详细说明一下吗？}
#{223}{}{Help? Me?! Not that I was some wimp or piss-pants, but it's a difficult situation, you see. And in this case... I need support, so to speak.}
{223}{}{救命啊？我？！并不是说我是个懦夫或尿裤子，但这是一个困难的情况，你看。在这种情况下...可以说，我需要支持。}
#{224}{}{Tell me more.}
{224}{}{告诉我更多。}
#{225}{}{You are useless to me, then. Bye.}
{225}{}{那你对我没用。再见。}
#{226}{}{What kind of support?}
{226}{}{什么样的支持？}
#{227}{}{Then tell me, what kind of help do you need.}
{227}{}{那告诉我，你需要什么样的帮助。}
#{228}{}{200 bucks and nothing else!}
{228}{}{200块，别的什么都没有！}
#{229}{}{Why do you need money in such a hurry?}
{229}{}{你为什么这么急着要钱？}
#{230}{}{Alright, here's your 200 bucks.}
{230}{}{好的，这是你的200美元。}
#{231}{}{Two hundreds for a story? That's too much!}
{231}{}{一个故事要两百？太过分了！}
#{232}{}{I knew it. Another beggar!}
{232}{}{我就知道。又一个乞丐！}
#{233}{}{No, look for money by yourself, I'm leaving.}
{233}{}{不，你自己找钱，我走了。}
#{234}{}{You think I'm enjoying this?! All my peanuts in my life were honest earned, and now I'm in dire situation with no way out.}
{234}{}{你觉得我很享受吗？！我这辈子的花生米都是老老实实挣来的，现在我的处境很悲惨，没有出路。}
#{235}{}{How much do you need?}
{235}{}{你需要多少钱？}
#{236}{}{I need to get to the Vegas badly. But caravaneers won't help for free, they ask for a prepayment. Everyone here stand for themselves. That's it.}
{236}{}{我很想去维加斯。但商队不会免费提供帮助，他们要求提前还款。这里的每个人都代表自己。就这样。}
#{237}{}{So how much do you need?}
{237}{}{你需要多少钱？}
#{238}{}{You're a caravaneer?! So what's stopping you from reaching Vegas?}
{238}{}{你是商队队员？！是什么阻止你去维加斯？}
#{239}{}{By myself?! Oh no, I'm not that stupid. My fellows are lost, and other caravans refuse to pick me up without prepayment. Because I'm a stranger to everyone else.}
{239}{}{我一个人？！哦，不，我没那么傻。我的同伴都迷路了，其他商队不提前付款就拒绝接我。因为我对其他人都不熟悉。}
#{240}{}{Too bad, the only one thing I could offer is this comic book.}
{240}{}{太糟糕了，我唯一能提供的就是这本漫画书。}
#{241}{}{Just what I need. Here's your 200 bucks for a comic book.}
{241}{}{正是我需要的。这是你200美元买一本漫画书的钱。}
#{242}{}{No, I don't need it.}
{242}{}{不，我不需要。}
#{243}{}{I'd better go, until you start to sell me your pants.}
{243}{}{我还是走吧，直到你把裤子卖给我。}
#{244}{}{Well, that's fair. But I don't care. Now I can pay for the escort - that's what matters. Thanks, wanderer.}
{244}{}{嗯，这很公平。但我不在乎。现在我可以付押运费了-这才是最重要的。谢谢，流浪者。}
#{245}{}{Now will you tell me what happened with your caravan?}
{245}{}{现在你能告诉我你的车队发生了什么事吗？}
#{246}{}{You're welcome. Happy trails.}
{246}{}{不客气。快乐的小径。}
#{247}{}{Seriously?! You just give me two hundreds?! You are the nicest fellow I have ever met in the wasteland! No kidding!}
{247}{}{说真的？！你就给我两百？！你是我在荒地见过的最好的人！别开玩笑！}
#{248}{}{Why not! But it's a long story.}
{248}{}{为什么不！但说来话长。}
#{249}{}{Go on.}
{249}{}{继续。}
#{250}{}{Then tell me another time.}
{250}{}{那再告诉我一次。}
#{300}{}{Now, we transported the goods from Reno to Vegas. And, like always, stopped by Wind of War to refill our water resources and sleep.}
{300}{}{现在，我们把货物从雷诺运到维加斯。而且，像往常一样，被战风阻挡，重新补充我们的水资源和睡眠。}
#{301}{}{What, too scared to sleep in the wastes?}
{301}{}{什么，害怕睡在荒地里？}
#{302}{}{I understand. It is reasonable.}
{302}{}{我理解。这是合理的。}
#{303}{}{Tell me another time, I feel it's gonna take lots of time.}
{303}{}{再告诉我一次，我觉得要花很多时间。}
#{304}{}{We're not, but why should we hand over our asses to the mutants?}
{304}{}{我们不是，但为什么要把我们的屁股交给变种人？}
#{305}{}{Well yeah, pretty reasonable. What's next?}
{305}{}{是啊，很合理。下一步是什么？}
#{306}{}{Oh well. Excuse approved. What's next?}
{306}{}{哦，好吧。请原谅。下一步是什么？}
#{307}{}{We slept here, on the railway station. By the morning, we were ready to hit the road. But suddenly some soldier comes to us and starts asking about where we a heading to and what are we transporting. And with these militaries you tend to keep your mouth shut.}
{307}{}{我们睡在这里，在火车站。到了早上，我们准备上路了。但是突然有个士兵过来问我们要去哪里，要运送什么。在这些军队里，你总是闭嘴。}
#{308}{}{And why all these soldiers are so insolent?}
{308}{}{为什么这些士兵都这么无礼？}
#{309}{}{Does this story lead to something or not?}
{309}{}{这个故事有没有什么线索？}
#{310}{}{Sound familiar. Oh, this militant to the bone...}
{310}{}{听起来很熟悉。哦，这个好战的家伙...}
#{311}{}{Well, you go and ask them. They, probably, think that they are in charge here and run the show. Did you see that guy with the broken face in the next room? Here's what it is.}
{311}{}{好吧，你去问问他们。他们，可能认为他们是这里的负责人，负责这个节目。你看到隔壁房间那个脸骨折的人了吗？事情是这样的。}
#{312}{}{Of course, I told you it's gonna be a long story!}
{312}{}{当然，我告诉过你这会是一个很长的故事！}
#{313}{}{Oh, these soldiers... But let's get back to your caravan.}
{313}{}{哦，这些士兵...但让我们回到你的车队。}
#{314}{}{Right. But I'm not about it. So, this guy comes to us, starts to get on our nerves with his questions, all that important, so sick of him... And also drunk. We barely managed to bundle him out. It's good that we didn't get into a fistfight.}
{314}{}{正确的。但我不在乎。所以，这个家伙来找我们，开始用他的问题让我们紧张，所有那些重要的问题，让我们厌倦了他...而且还喝醉了。我们勉强把他打发走了。幸好我们没有打架。}
#{315}{}{And what this all about?}
{315}{}{这是怎么回事？}
#{316}{}{Things may go worse. You were lucky.}
{316}{}{情况可能会更糟。你很幸运。}
#{317}{}{Wait a bit, I'm trying to recall the sequence of events...}
{317}{}{等等，我想回忆一下事件的顺序...}
#{318}{}{Yeah-yeah, sure.}
{318}{}{是的，当然。}
#{319}{}{Then we moved to Vegas, we chose the path along the route. But then our leader said that raiders typically hide along the routes. Let's go through the desert, he says, off the road.}
{319}{}{然后我们搬到维加斯，选择了沿途的路。但后来我们的头领说袭击者通常会沿着路线躲起来。让我们穿过沙漠，他说，离开公路。}
#{320}{}{Yeah-yeah, I've seen such leaders already. Any signs of danger - and...}
{320}{}{是的，我已经见过这样的领导人了。任何危险的迹象-而且...}
#{321}{}{Hmm. Safer, but slower.}
{321}{}{嗯。更安全，但慢一点。}
#{322}{}{Hey, don't start it! If you ever come into such scrapes a couple of times, you'll also become cautious.}
{322}{}{嘿，别动手！如果你遇到过几次这样的麻烦，你也会变得谨慎。}
#{323}{}{Okay-okay, go on.}
{323}{}{好吧，继续。}
#{324}{}{We then told him, go around the route - and it's a day to lose. So we reached the gas station in the evening, at nightfall.}
{324}{}{然后我们告诉他，沿着这条路走――这是一天的损失。所以我们在傍晚时分到达了加油站。}
#{325}{}{You like talking to yourself?}
{325}{}{你喜欢自言自语吗？}
#{326}{}{Gas station?}
{326}{}{加油站？}
#{327}{}{Go on.}
{327}{}{继续。}
#{328}{}{The old gas station. We always make a stop here on the way from Wind of War to Vegas. Convenient checkpoint. It's always nice to sleep under the roof than in the tent in the middle of desert.}
{328}{}{旧加油站。从《战风》到维加斯的路上，我们总是在这里停留。方便的检查站。睡在屋顶下总比睡在沙漠中央的帐篷里好。}
#{329}{}{I'm gonna sleep because of your story myself... Eh... Go on!}
{329}{}{因为你的故事我要睡觉了...呃...继续！}
#{330}{}{Of course.}
{330}{}{当然。}
#{331}{}{As we went to sleep... And then! I hear - someone's coming!}
{331}{}{我们睡觉的时候...然后！我听说-有人来了！}
#{332}{}{Well finally, something interesting in your story begins!}
{332}{}{最后，你的故事开始有趣了！}
#{333}{}{Wow! Who was that?}
{333}{}{哇！那是谁？}
#{334}{}{While other were sleeping, I, to avoid raising a noise, got up, went outside, and right in the face - BA-A-AM!!! Shin, fucking, boot - right in the loft! I even fell on the floor! Then all the guys jumped up, grabbed the guns. Well, I thought, the fun part begins.}
{334}{}{当其他人睡着的时候，为了避免吵闹，我站起来，走到外面，直冲着他们的脸-哇哇！！！申，他妈的，靴子-就在阁楼里！我甚至摔倒在地上！然后所有的人都跳起来，抢了枪。嗯，我想，有趣的部分开始了。}
#{335}{}{Gunfight?!}
{335}{}{枪战？！}
#{336}{}{These bastards surrounded us from all sides. Two of us got shot first, others ran away somewhere. Good thing I ran away into the bu... Eh... As I said, I know a lot of tricks - disappeared in the most appropriate time.}
{336}{}{这些混蛋从四面八方包围了我们。我们两个先中枪，其他人跑掉了。幸好我跑进了学校...呃...正如我所说，我知道很多窍门-消失在最合适的时间。}
#{337}{}{What's next?}
{337}{}{下一步是什么？}
#{338}{}{I don't know myself! Darkness surrounds, shots, bustle. Well, guys fled, and raiders there, at the gas station, took down someone and started to hammer.}
{338}{}{我不了解我自己！黑暗包围，枪声，喧闹。好吧，伙计们逃走了，袭击者在加油站抓到了一个人，开始用锤子敲打。}
#{339}{}{And that's all you story?}
{339}{}{你说的就这些？}
#{340}{}{That's it?}
{340}{}{就这样？}
#{341}{}{Then I came back here. [Speaks quietly] But I don't believe one bit, that these are raiders. They don't speak like that, you know! And they are not that well organized, and not that clever. A strange situation!}
{341}{}{然后我回到这里。但我一点也不相信，他们是袭击者。他们不是那样说话的，你知道的！他们组织得不好，也不那么聪明。奇怪的情况！}
#{342}{}{That's how it was...}
{342}{}{就这样...}
#{343}{}{So I was left with nothing and lost contact with my fellows. Hopefully, a trip to Vegas will give me a second chance.}
{343}{}{所以我一无所有，与同伴失去了联系。希望去维加斯能给我第二次机会。}
#{344}{}{Hmm, sad story. Well, happy trails.}
{344}{}{嗯，悲惨的故事。好吧，快乐的小径。}
#{345}{}{It happens. Well, now you are on your own.}
{345}{}{这是常有的事。好吧，现在你只能靠自己了。}
#{346}{}{Thank you for listening! If necessary, you'll find me in Vegas.}
{346}{}{谢谢你的聆听！如果有必要，你会在维加斯找到我。}
#{347}{}{Yeah. Goodbye.}
{347}{}{是 啊。再见。}
#{348}{}{And by the way, what was that caravan you worked for?}
{348}{}{顺便问一下，你工作的车队是什么？}
#{349}{}{Hello, wanderer!}
{349}{}{你好，流浪者！}
#{350}{}{You were saying that you're a caravaneer...}
{350}{}{你刚才说你是个大篷车...}
#{351}{}{Yes, that's it... To be precise, was. And now I'm not so sure. Our guys ran away and I don't know if they still live.}
{351}{}{是的，就是这样...准确地说，是的。现在我不太确定。我们的人逃跑了，我不知道他们是否还活着。}
#{352}{}{And what was that caravan?}
{352}{}{那辆大篷车是什么？}
#{353}{}{Right, bye.}
{353}{}{好的，再见。}
#{354}{}{A small brigade. Called "Speed Hawk".}
{354}{}{一个小旅。被称为“速度鹰”。}
#{355}{}{I know them. Four of your friends have recently been parked in Vegas.}
{355}{}{我认识他们。你的四个朋友最近停在维加斯。}
#{356}{}{Oh, so you don't know... Friend, be strong, all your comrades were killed. Everyone of them.}
{356}{}{哦，所以你不知道...朋友，坚强点，你所有的同志都被杀了。他们每个人。}
#{357}{}{Sounds familiar. I'll return if I remember.}
{357}{}{听起来很熟悉。如果我记得的话，我会回来的。}
#{358}{}{You've found the last remaining member of "Speed Hawk".}
{358}{}{你找到了“速度鹰”的最后一个成员。}
#{359}{}{It's a great news! I'll go to them as soon as possible! Thank you, wanderer, I'm so glad I met you!}
{359}{}{这是个好消息！我会尽快去找他们！谢谢你，流浪汉，见到你真高兴！}
#{360}{}{You don't want to add anything?}
{360}{}{你不想添加任何内容？}
#{361}{}{So long.}
{361}{}{这么久。}
#{362}{}{Are you sure? How did you know?!}
{362}{}{你确定？你怎么知道的？！}
#{363}{}{I... Eh... Was there and saw everything.}
{363}{}{一、 ...呃...在那里看到了一切。}
#{364}{}{Well, rumors are afloat. I'll check it out and come back.}
{364}{}{好吧，谣言满天飞。我去看看再回来。}
#{365}{}{Ah, come on, don't worry! They're alive, your comrades are waiting for you in Vegas.}
{365}{}{啊，来吧，别担心！他们还活着，你的战友在维加斯等你。}
#{366}{}{Well, I was prepared for the worst... I guess lights of Vegas shine not for me. Local caravaneers won't take on the job if they'll know my story. That's a superstition, my friend. Well, I'd better head to Reno and try to improve my life there.}
{366}{}{我已经做好了最坏的打算...我想维加斯的灯光不适合我。如果当地的商队知道我的故事，他们不会接受这份工作。那是迷信，我的朋友。嗯，我最好去雷诺，努力改善那里的生活。}
#{367}{}{That's up to you to decide, I've done my job.}
{367}{}{那由你决定，我已经完成了我的工作。}
#{1200}{}{[You see a worried caravaneer] Uh... Hello, wanderer! I guess, you came to me for a reason but, believe me, I'm not in the right mood to help anyone.}
