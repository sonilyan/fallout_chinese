#{100}{}{You see Bob Neil.}
{100}{}{你看到鲍勃・尼尔了。}
#{101}{}{You see Bob Neil the substation chief.}
{101}{}{你看到变电站主任鲍勃・尼尔了。}
#{102}{}{Bob Neil is dead. Imagine the bloodbath that's gonna start over Hoover Dam now...}
{102}{}{鲍勃・尼尔死了。想象一下胡佛大坝上的血案...}
#{300}{}{New in town? I don't remember seeing you...}
{300}{}{新来的？我不记得见过你...}
#{301}{}{Yes, how can I help?}
{301}{}{是的，我能帮忙吗？}
#{302}{}{Oh, it's you. What do you need?}
{302}{}{哦，是你。你需要什么？}
#{305}{}{Don't worry, I'm going.}
{305}{}{别担心，我要走了。}
#{310}{}{So, who am I talking to?}
{310}{}{那么，我在和谁说话？}
#{311}{}{To me, obviously. I think I'd rather hear *your* name first.}
{311}{}{对我来说，很明显。我想我还是先听听你的名字吧。}
#{312}{}{My name is }
{312}{}{我的名字是}
#{313}{}{. And you are...}
{313}{}{. 你是...}
#{314}{}{None of your business old man.}
{314}{}{不关你的事，老头子。}
#{315}{}{In that case, I think I'd rather avoid talking to you.}
{315}{}{那样的话，我想我还是不要和你说话。}
#{316}{}{Oh, good manners? That's great. My name is Bob Neil, I am currently in charge of this dam. So, what brought you here?}
{316}{}{哦，礼貌？太好了。我叫鲍勃・尼尔，目前负责这座大坝。那么，什么风把你吹来了？}
#{317}{}{Curiosity, mostly. What can you tell me about this place?}
{317}{}{主要是好奇。关于这个地方你能告诉我什么？}
#{318}{}{I've got a piece of advice for you: watch your words in this city, wanderer. That is very important, especially here.}
{318}{}{我有一个建议给你：在这个城市小心你的话，流浪者。这是非常重要的，尤其是在这里。}
#{319}{}{Uhuh, well, goodbye.}
{319}{}{呃，好吧，再见。}
#{320}{}{Thanks for the tip. So, what's your name?}
{320}{}{谢谢你的小费。你叫什么名字？}
#{322}{}{If it's that important, I'm Bob Neil and I'm in charge of this dam. Any more questions?}
{322}{}{如果有那么重要的话，我是鲍勃・尼尔，负责这个水坝。还有问题吗？}
#{323}{}{That's all for now, see you.}
{323}{}{就这些了，再见。}
#{324}{}{I don't like that. It would be best if you leave.}
{324}{}{我不喜欢那样。你最好离开。}
#{325}{}{With pleasure.}
{325}{}{我很乐意。}
#{326}{}{Good, I won't disturb you.}
{326}{}{很好，我不会打扰你的。}
#{330}{}{Can you tell me about this place?}
{330}{}{你能告诉我这个地方吗？}
#{331}{}{I think I can spare a little time for that. What would you like to know?}
{331}{}{我想我可以抽出一点时间。你想知道什么？}
#{332}{}{History. How did you manage to set all this up?}
{332}{}{历史。你是怎么安排的？}
#{333}{}{What is this place?}
{333}{}{这是什么地方？}
#{334}{}{Do you supply the entire city with electricity?}
{334}{}{你给整个城市供电吗？}
#{335}{}{What are all these people doing?}
{335}{}{这些人在干什么？}
#{336}{}{What is your job?}
{336}{}{你是从事什么工作的？}
#{337}{}{That's enough. I wanted to know something else.}
{337}{}{够了。我还想知道别的。}
#{340}{}{It wasn't hard to get this up and running, most of it was already automatically working since the Great War. The problems began when the equipment started to wear out. I took the matter into my hands and started selling electricity for a reasonable price to help with the upkeep. But the City Hall and the local businessmen decided to take everything for themselves. After a whole bunch of conflicts, we had to find a compromise. So, we came up with a stocks system. Although it's not perfect, but it helped avoid outright bloodshed and let me keep the dam in my hands.}
{340}{}{这并不难启动和运行，其中大部分已经自动工作以来，伟大的战争。当设备开始磨损时，问题就出现了。我接手了这件事，开始以合理的价格出售电力，以帮助维护。但市政厅和当地商人决定把一切都据为己有。在一大堆冲突之后，我们不得不找到一个折衷方案。所以，我们提出了一个股票系统。虽然它并不完美，但它帮助避免了彻头彻尾的流血事件，让我把水坝控制在手中。}
#{341}{}{What about the dam?}
{341}{}{大坝怎么办？}
#{342}{}{The dam worked automatically since the War. Still does. The real work is being done on substations and power lines - the places where electricity is distributed around the city.}
{342}{}{自战争以来，水坝自动运行。现在仍然如此。真正的工作是在变电站和输电线上进行的，这些地方的电力分布在城市周围。}
#{343}{}{This is electric station number one. Most of the electricity produced by the dam is generated here. In the future, looking at how Vegas is growing, we'll need to launch the second station. We've got enough problems with one for the time being.}
{343}{}{这是一号发电站。大坝产生的大部分电力都是在这里产生的。在未来，看看维加斯是如何发展的，我们将需要推出第二站。我们现在的问题已经够多了。}
#{344}{}{Tell me the history. How did you manage to get this place running?}
{344}{}{告诉我历史。你是怎么让这个地方运转起来的？}
#{345}{}{Well, almost. A few districts and individual buildings have decided to supply themselves with their own power, using small nuclear reactors and generators. Although the main portion of the city's power comes from us.}
{345}{}{嗯，差不多了。一些地区和个别建筑物决定使用小型核反应堆和发电机，自行供电。尽管城市的主要力量来自我们。}
#{346}{}{They're responsible for making sure the equipment is working and this place is tidy. We've also got a team for maintaining and repairing the power lines.}
{346}{}{他们负责确保设备正常工作，这个地方整洁。我们还有一个维护和修理电线的小组。}
#{347}{}{Handling public relations and making sure these idiots don't do something stupid or late.}
{347}{}{处理公共关系，确保这些白痴不会做傻事或迟到。}
#{348}{}{Sounds like you're unhappy with how your employees are working.}
{348}{}{听起来你对员工的工作方式不满意。}
#{349}{}{Now is not our best times, thanks to the administrative war for ownership of the dam. So, people are not willing to work here, and those who do - can't handle the tight schedule and shoddy pay.}
{349}{}{现在不是我们的最佳时期，多亏了大坝所有权的行政战争。所以，人们不愿意在这里工作，而那些愿意在这里工作的人――无法处理紧张的工作日程和低劣的工资。}
#{350}{}{Strange situation for the city's main enterprise, wouldn't you say?}
{350}{}{这个城市的主要企业情况很奇怪，你说呢？}
#{351}{}{The damn shareholders set everything up in a way to leave us with barely any money to pay the workers. They're doing this to leave us penniless and then grab the dam for themselves. Gecko scums...}
{351}{}{该死的股东们把一切都安排好了，让我们几乎没有钱支付工人的工资。他们这样做是为了让我们身无分文，然后自己抢水坝。壁虎渣...}
#{352}{}{If you're in short for workers, I could try and look for some new people.}
{352}{}{如果你是工人的简称，我可以试着找些新人。}
#{353}{}{I already told you. We need cheap labour.}
{353}{}{我已经告诉过你了。我们需要廉价劳动力。}
#{354}{}{Handling public relations and making sure everything works smoothly. We're doing quite well thanks to the new labour force. Thank you, wanderer.}
{354}{}{处理公共关系，确保一切顺利进行。多亏了新的劳动力，我们做得很好。谢谢你，流浪者。}
#{355}{}{I understand. Let's go back a little.}
{355}{}{我理解。让我们再往回走一点。}
#{356}{}{An interesting offer, but if it were that simple, I would've done it myself a long time ago. There isn't much choice. Most likely, we'll have to buy slaves. But the slavers guild is one of the stakeholders. I don't need additional pressure.}
{356}{}{一个有趣的提议，但如果它是那么简单，我早就自己做了。别无选择。很可能，我们得买奴隶。但奴隶公会是利益相关者之一。我不需要额外的压力。}
#{357}{}{What if somebody else buys slaves and sells them to you?}
{357}{}{如果别人买奴隶卖给你呢？}
#{358}{}{Slaves are expensive. It's hard to find anyone capable of buying 20 slaves, and, at the same time, not having sights for the dam. It's a dead end, shortly speaking.}
{358}{}{奴隶很贵。很难找到一个有能力买20个奴隶的人，同时，也很难不去看水坝。简而言之，这是个死胡同。}
#{359}{}{I'll see what I can do.}
{359}{}{我看看我能做什么。}
#{360}{}{I can't promise anything.}
{360}{}{我不能保证什么。}
#{370}{}{Have you thought about using the freaks as labour?}
{370}{}{你想过把这些怪胎当劳力吗？}
#{371}{}{Haven't you heard? The police have purged that stinking filth from our city. Even if I wanted to, there's nobody left to hire.}
{371}{}{你没听说吗？警察已经清除了我们城市的臭气。即使我愿意，也没有人可以雇佣了。}
#{372}{}{Another question then.}
{372}{}{那又是一个问题。}
#{373}{}{Hm. I don't have any more questions.}
{373}{}{嗯，我没有问题了。}
#{374}{}{Do you really think those rotting corpses are suitable for work?! Even so, their reputation in the city does not make them trustworthy.}
{374}{}{你真的认为那些腐烂的尸体适合工作吗？！即便如此，他们在城里的名声也不能使他们值得信赖。}
#{375}{}{The police have vouched for them, that should count for something.}
{375}{}{警察已经为他们作了担保，这应该是有意义的。}
#{376}{}{You're unhappy with their reputation? I'd like another question then.}
{376}{}{你对他们的名声不满意？那我想再问一个问题。}
#{377}{}{Hm. I don't have any more questions.}
{377}{}{嗯，我没有问题了。}
#{378}{}{Oh? I didn't know that. Thank you for telling me. How good are they at manual labour?}
{378}{}{哦？我不知道。谢谢你告诉我。他们的体力活干得怎么样？}
#{379}{}{Enough with the prejudice! They are cheap and effective workforce, despite the outward appearances.}
{379}{}{别再有偏见了！他们是廉价而有效的劳动力，尽管外表看起来很好。}
#{380}{}{I can tell you as a scientist, thanks to a combination of radiation and some virus, their cells were partially replaced by mineral-based analogies. Put simply, they have a whole array of physical advantages.}
{380}{}{作为一个科学家，我可以告诉你，由于辐射和一些病毒的结合，他们的细胞部分被矿物类似物所取代。简单地说，他们有一系列的物理优势。}
#{381}{}{Just trust me.}
{381}{}{相信我。}
#{382}{}{I don't know. I'll look into it.}
{382}{}{我不知道。我会调查的。}
#{383}{}{Well, if you're so confident about them, then you must have reasons. Considering their current position, they won't ask for much... Alright, you've convinced me. I'll give the freaks a chance and see how it goes. Thank you wanderer.}
{383}{}{好吧，如果你对他们这么有信心，那你一定有理由。考虑到他们现在的处境，他们不会要求太多...好吧，你说服我了。我会给那些怪胎一个机会看看进展如何。谢谢你，流浪者。}
#{384}{}{Great!}
{384}{}{太好了！}
#{385}{}{You convinced Bob Neil to hire the freaks.}
{385}{}{你说服了鲍勃・尼尔雇用那些怪胎。}
#{386}{}{Unconvincing. To base views on someone's inspiring speech is not the best idea. I hope you understand.}
{386}{}{没有说服力。把观点建立在某人鼓舞人心的演讲上并不是最好的主意。希望你能理解。}
#{387}{}{Hm, I'll need to think about this.}
{387}{}{嗯，我得考虑一下。}
#{388}{}{Oh, this is interesting! If they're more endurant and less affected by gas and radiation, then they'll make excellent workers. And considering their social position, they won't ask for much pay... Alright, you've convinced me. I'll work with the freaks and see how it turns out. Thank you, wanderer.}
{388}{}{哦，真有趣！如果他们的耐力更强，受气体和辐射的影响更小，那么他们将成为优秀的工人。考虑到他们的社会地位，他们不会要求太多的报酬...好吧，你说服我了。我会和怪胎们合作，看看结果如何。谢谢你，流浪者。}
#{389}{}{Great!}
{389}{}{太好了！}
#{390}{}{You know, you don't really look like a scientist...}
{390}{}{你知道，你看起来不像个科学家...}
#{391}{}{Of course, men with your reputation in Vegas deserve trust. You've convinced me. I'll work with the freaks and see how it turns out. Thank you, wanderer.}
{391}{}{当然，在维加斯有你名声的人值得信任。你说服了我。我会和怪胎们合作，看看结果如何。谢谢你，流浪者。}
#{392}{}{Honestly, I haven't heard much good about you. Why should I trust you?}
{392}{}{老实说，我没听说过你什么好消息。我为什么要相信你？}
#{393}{}{Ah, here's our savior of the damned. I knew that this is how it will end, sooner or later. Well, now that the ghouls are gone, we're back to square one. We need labour force.}
{393}{}{啊，这是我们的救世主。我知道事情迟早会这样结束的。好吧，既然食尸鬼都走了，我们又回到原点了。我们需要劳动力。}
#{394}{}{Unfortunate to hear. I hope you find a solution.}
{394}{}{真不幸。我希望你能找到解决办法。}
#{395}{}{I did everything I could to help. I don't want to hear your whining.}
{395}{}{我尽了我所能来帮忙。我不想听你的抱怨。}
#{396}{}{Looks like cheap labour is completely gone from the city...}
{396}{}{看起来廉价劳动力已经从城市里消失了...}
#{397}{}{Yeah, that's basically it. Slavertown is empty, the mayor won't give a cent to support us. I had hope for those ghouls, despite my repulsion for them. But, unfortunately even they are gone. Looks like the only thing left is to give the fate of the dam into the hands of those snobs from the Clean City and hope they won't boot me out like a dog.}
{397}{}{是的，基本上就是这样。斯拉夫镇是空的，市长一分钱也不肯支持我们。我对那些食尸鬼抱有希望，尽管我厌恶他们。但不幸的是，他们都走了。看来唯一剩下的就是把大坝的命运交给那些来自清洁城市的势利小人，希望他们不要像狗一样把我赶出去。}
#{398}{}{That's unfortunate to hear. I guess I'll go now. My things aren't quite as bad.}
{398}{}{听你这么说真不幸。我想我现在要走了。我的东西没那么糟。}
#{400}{}{I can sell you some slaves. Interested?}
{400}{}{我可以卖给你一些奴隶。有兴趣吗？}
#{401}{}{Hell yeah! But are you sure the slavers guild doesn't know what they're for?}
{401}{}{见鬼，耶！但是你确定奴隶公会不知道他们在干什么？}
#{402}{}{Yes, I am. Don't worry.}
{402}{}{是的，我是。别担心。}
#{403}{}{Well alright. Not like I have much choice, I'll have to satisfy with your slaves. By guild prices, they costs around 10000$. I'll buy them for 15000$.}
{403}{}{好吧，好吧。我没有太多选择，我只能满足于你的奴隶。按公会价格计算，它们的价格在10000美元左右。我要花15000美元买。}
#{404}{}{I'm fine with that.}
{404}{}{我不介意。}
#{405}{}{20000, no less. Otherwise I'll just find a different buyer.}
{405}{}{两万，不少。否则我就另谋高就了。}
#{406}{}{I changed my mind. Goodbye.}
{406}{}{我改变主意了。再见。}
#{407}{}{This is a robbery! But... Ugh... Hold on, I need them too much. Alright, I'll agree to 20000. But this is the bottom line.}
{407}{}{这是抢劫！但是...呃...等等，我太需要他们了。好吧，我同意两万。但这是底线。}
#{408}{}{Great, a pleasure doing business with you.}
{408}{}{很好，很高兴和你做生意。}
#{409}{}{No thanks, I'd rather look for different sellers.}
{409}{}{不，谢谢，我想找不同的卖家。}
#{410}{}{You won't find them. My deal is guaranteed.}
{410}{}{你找不到他们。我的交易是有保证的。}
#{411}{}{Well fine. Let's go with 15000.}
{411}{}{很好。我们一起去吧。}
#{412}{}{Great deal! Now things will go much better.}
{412}{}{太好了！现在情况会好得多。}
#{413}{}{Good luck.}
{413}{}{祝你好运。}
#{414}{}{You sold your slaves to Bob Neil.}
{414}{}{你把奴隶卖给了鲍勃・尼尔。}
#{415}{}{How are those new workers?}
{415}{}{那些新工人怎么样？}
#{416}{}{Those freaks are a treasure! They aren't pretentious, very endurant and they're not afraid of heat of radiation. Best of all, they work for nothing! And... Honestly, sometimes I like their jokes. A great bunch. I'm glad they're with us.}
{416}{}{那些怪胎是宝藏！它们不自命不凡，非常耐性，也不怕辐射热。最棒的是，他们白干了！还有...老实说，有时候我喜欢他们的笑话。一大群人。我很高兴他们和我们在一起。}
#{417}{}{Good, I've got another question.}
{417}{}{很好，我还有一个问题。}
#{418}{}{Great. I need to go now.}
{418}{}{伟大的。我得走了。}
#{419}{}{I don't regret the purchase. There are a few problems with the slaves. I had to hire a chef and supervisors, but that's nothing compared to what they will do for us. I'm glad and... Thank you.}
{419}{}{我不后悔购买。奴隶们有一些问题。我不得不雇一个厨师和主管，但和他们为我们做的相比，这算不了什么。我很高兴...非常感谢。}
#{450}{}{Why does Hal Wallace hate you?}
{450}{}{哈尔・华莱士为什么恨你？}
#{451}{}{What? What are you talking about?}
{451}{}{什么？你在说什么？}
#{452}{}{He, uh, was looking for someone to get you arrested.}
{452}{}{他，呃，在找人把你抓起来。}
#{453}{}{We asked me to get you out of the way.}
{453}{}{我们让我帮你让开。}
#{454}{}{Well, there's rumors that he has something against you.}
{454}{}{嗯，有传言说他对你有意见。}
#{455}{}{Fucking son of a bitch! I've suspected him for a while now!}
{455}{}{他妈的狗娘养的！我已经怀疑他一段时间了！}
#{456}{}{What are you talking about?}
{456}{}{你在说什么？}
#{457}{}{I don't care. Tell me why I shouldn't do this contract?}
{457}{}{我不在乎。告诉我为什么我不该签这个合同？}
#{458}{}{He's ready to act openly now? Hm, did he really managed to find a few more aces up his sleeve?}
{458}{}{他准备公开行动了吗？嗯，他真的找到了更多的王牌吗？}
#{459}{}{This city loves dark dealings behind your back. And you can bet your bottom dollar - Wallace is involved in them.}
{459}{}{这个城市喜欢在你背后暗中交易。你可以打赌，华莱士和他们有关。}
#{460}{}{What are you talking about?}
{460}{}{你在说什么？}
#{461}{}{All the influential people in Vegas, including Hal, are trying to claim ownership of Hoover Dam. Usually, they try to do it legally, but recently, someone has been trying to sabotage my company.}
{461}{}{所有在维加斯有影响力的人，包括哈尔，都试图声称拥有胡佛大坝。通常，他们是想合法地这么做，但最近，有人试图破坏我的公司。}
#{462}{}{How was this done?}
{462}{}{这是怎么做到的？}
#{463}{}{First, we've started to lose important workers. Then obscene insults and lying accusations started to appear on the walls of the city. There was some mess with redistribution of stocks in Mayor's office, the police opened a few muddy cases, intended to ruin our reputation. Those who want to get us bankrupt, definitely know what they're doing.}
{463}{}{首先，我们已经开始失去重要的员工。然后，猥亵的侮辱和谎言的指控开始出现在城市的墙壁上。市长办公室的股票再分配有些混乱，警察开了几个烂案，企图破坏我们的声誉。那些想让我们破产的人，肯定知道他们在做什么。}
#{464}{}{But why?}
{464}{}{但为什么呢？}
#{465}{}{If we go bankrupt, then a war for the dam will begin for real. The city will be shattered, people will die. But, anyone who wins will be the most influential man in the city. Some would consider the risk justified.}
{465}{}{如果我们破产了，那么一场争夺大坝的战争将真正开始。城市将被摧毁，人们将死去。但是，任何获胜的人都将是这个城市最有影响力的人。有些人会认为这种风险是合理的。}
#{466}{}{What about Wallace?}
{466}{}{华莱士呢？}
#{467}{}{[Bob Neil doesn't notice you recording the conversation on your Pip-Boy.] He's a treacherous gangster. He never acts by himself, but rather sends middlemen to deal with his dirty work, so nobody could blame him.}
{467}{}{[鲍勃・尼尔没有注意到你在用你的皮普小子录对话。]他是个奸诈的歹徒。他从不自己动手，而是派中间人来处理他的脏活，所以没人能责怪他。}
#{468}{}{I can deal with him. Once and for all.}
{468}{}{我能对付他。一劳永逸。}
#{469}{}{So, why shouldn't I do the task he gave me?}
{469}{}{那么，为什么我不能完成他交给我的任务呢？}
#{470}{}{Well, that's your problems. I'd rather stay out of it.}
{470}{}{那是你的问题。我宁愿置身事外。}
#{471}{}{I'm not a fan of forceful decisions, but this has gone too far. Alright. I will pay you 5000$ to get rid of him.}
{471}{}{我不喜欢强有力的决定，但这太过分了。好吧。我会付给你5000美元来除掉他。}
#{472}{}{Alright. I'll do it.}
{472}{}{好吧。我会的。}
#{473}{}{I'll think about it.}
{473}{}{我会考虑的。}
#{474}{}{I assume your interest is only in payment. In that case, I have a counter offer... You don't care who to get rid of, right? 5000$.}
{474}{}{我想你的兴趣只在于付款。那样的话，我有个还盘...你不在乎该摆脱谁，对吧？5000$.}
#{475}{}{Like hell, old man! I'm fulfilling Wallace's task!}
{475}{}{见鬼，老头子！我在完成华莱士的任务！}
#{476}{}{Of course. Pretty reasonable from you. Now, please leave. All the best.}
{476}{}{当然。你说的很有道理。现在，请离开。祝你一切顺利。}
#{477}{}{Goodbye.}
{477}{}{再见。}
#{478}{}{In that case, I have no choice...}
{478}{}{那样的话，我别无选择...}
#{479}{}{[Leave]}
{479}{}{[离开]}
#{480}{}{Wallace won't be a problem anymore. I did my part of the deal. What about yours?}
{480}{}{华莱士不再是问题了。我做了我该做的。你的呢？}
#{481}{}{Perfect! I heard all about it. Here's your payment, as promised. But we don't know anything and had no deals with each other. I hope you understand.}
{481}{}{很 完美！我都听说了。这是你答应的付款。但我们什么都不知道，彼此也没有交易。希望你能理解。}
#{482}{}{I hope now your streak of bad luck will end?}
{482}{}{我希望现在你的坏运气会结束？}
#{483}{}{Of course, no problem.}
{483}{}{当然，没问题。}
#{484}{}{It's stupid to assume that one man was behind the whole thing. There are others. But the biggest parasite has been eliminated. That means I can sleep well at night, so as our employees.}
{484}{}{认为整件事的幕后黑手是一个人是愚蠢的。还有其他的。但是最大的寄生虫已经被消灭了。这意味着我晚上可以睡得很好，我们的员工也一样。}
#{485}{}{}
{485}{}{}
#{486}{}{Understood.}
{486}{}{理解。}
#{487}{}{Now Wallace's shares should be redistributed among the other stakeholders, including part of it coming back to dam. This is good. The Clean City will only benefit, as everybody. I doubt anyone will ask for a recalculation.}
{487}{}{现在华莱士的股份应该在其他利益相关者之间重新分配，包括部分回到大坝。这很好。清洁城市只会像每个人一样受益。我怀疑有人会要求重新计算。}
#{488}{}{Understood. I need to go now.}
{488}{}{理解。我得走了。}
#{489}{}{Explain to me first, what's going on here.}
{489}{}{先跟我解释一下，这是怎么回事。}
#{1318}{}{I've got a piece of advice for you: watch your words in this city, wanderer. That is very important, especially here.}
{1318}{}{我有一个建议给你：在这个城市小心你的话，流浪者。这是非常重要的，尤其是在这里。}

{1391}{}{当然，在维加斯有你名声的女人值得信任。你说服了我。我会和怪胎们合作，看看结果如何。谢谢你，流浪者。}
#{1393}{}{Ah, here's our savior of the damned. I knew that this is how it will end sooner or later. Well, now that the ghouls are gone, we're back to square one. We need labour force.}

#{1402}{}{I'm sure. Don't worry.}

#{1404}{}{I agree with the price.}
{1404}{}{我同意这个价格。}
#{1406}{}{I changed my mind. Take care.}
