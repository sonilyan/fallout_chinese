{100}{}{You see: a holy man.}
{101}{}{An old looking man, you think, but his long vestment prevents you from fully seeing his face.}
# pocetak govora
{102}{}{Yes, my child, who are you?}
{103}{}{I'm new here. Say, what's going on here.} #script will add "I'm dude name." to the start of this
#odgovor priest-a
{104}{}{Nothing is going on here! [Raises his hand.] As you can see I'm a local priest but I also make medicine, if
 somebody needs a cure for something I make it with my recipes. So my child, tell me, what is the purpose of your
 visit?}
#odgovor dude
{106}{}{Just came to say hello. I'll be going now.}
#posao broc if Talked_to_Mike_1;
{107}{}{Mike told me that you need some ingredients for your potions.}
# Holy man odgovor
{108}{}{Well, if Mike told you... Yes, I do need someone to find me 3 broc flowers. There are plenty of them in the
 wild, but I'm sure you can find some in the garden. Now go my child.}
{109}{}{Alright.}
#holy pita za 3 cveta
{110}{}{So my child, you have returned. Have you found those broc flowers I need?}
{111}{}{Yes, here they are.}
{112}{}{No, I don't have them.}
#dude ima 3 cveta
{113}{}{Thank you my child. This will help a lot. I can give you this healing powder as my thanks.}
{114}{}{Thanks, holy one.}
#dude nema 3 cveta
{115}{}{No, my child, you don't have them. Come back when you do.}
{116}{}{Of course.}
#dude opet prica
{117}{}{Yes, my child?}
#dude obavoi posao
{118}{}{You have done a great job, my child. Go in peace.}
{119}{}{Take care, holy one.}
#
{120}{}{Evil are your thoughts. If you're looking for salvation or forgiveness, then you are in the wrong place.}
{121}{}{I sure am. And I'm out of here.}
{122}{}{Let me show you what evil thoughts I'm having right now.}
#569,1
{123}{}{Can I ask you something, Father?}
#
{124}{}{Of course, my child. What wisdom do you seek?}
{125}{}{Did you see some strange people in robes coming here at night?}
{126}{}{Just passing by, sorry for the disturbance.}
#
{127}{}{I couldn't say my child. Your Father is not present here at night time, rather he is resting for tomorrow's
 service.}
{128}{}{So, people can enter this church whenever they want?}
#
{129}{}{Of course, my child. This is the house of God and as the people are his children, it is only natural that they
 come here asking forgiveness from their Father.}
{130}{}{Yes but what if somebody...? Uh, nevermind. See you later, Father.}
#
{131}{}{I have nothing more to say to you my child. Go in peace.}
{132}{}{Goodbye.}
#
{133}{}{Have you seen any strangers lately?}
#
{134}{}{I'm sorry but my memory does not serve me well. I can barely remember what I ate yesterday...}
{135}{}{Where do you keep those recipes of yours?}
{136}{}{You wouldn't lie to me, am I right?}
{137}{}{Alright. I'll be going then.}
#recipes...
{138}{}{In what people used to call "books", but I'm sure a primitive such as yourself doesn't know what I'm
 talking about.}
{139}{}{No, I don't have a clue what you're talking about.}
{140}{}{Ah, those... Sorry, it was a misunderstanding. I'm going now.}
#clue...
{141}{}{Well then, it's never too late to learn something... Here. [He hands you an old, dusty book.] I hope you enjoy
 it. Excuse me now, I have to continue with my prayers...}
{142}{}{Hmm... I guess I'll be learning something from this.}
#lie to me...
{143}{}{You are too young to understand God's ways. Go in peace now, I have to continue with my prayers.}
{144}{}{I'm going; for now.}
#
{145}{}{Can I ask you something?}
