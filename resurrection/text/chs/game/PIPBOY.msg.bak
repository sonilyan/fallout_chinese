{1000}{}{Why is it that an organism is plagued by mutation? What}
{1001}{}{causes some to be born with the defect we call}
{1002}{}{mutation? What causes the creation of mutants?}
{1003}{}{**END-PAR**}
{1004}{}{Let us first briefly explain what mutations are. As you}
{1005}{}{surely know, the entire "blueprint" of the human body}
{1006}{}{is located in the nucleus of each and every cell. The}
{1007}{}{information about how any given organ should develop is}
{1008}{}{encoded in the chromosomes - long  "crumpled" sections}
{1009}{}{of the double helix of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).}
{1010}{}{Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. On these}
{1011}{}{chromosomes, in specific places known as loci,}
{1012}{}{stretches of DNA are positioned. They are responsible}
{1013}{}{for the creation of a particular trait or set of}
{1014}{}{traits. We call these stretches genes. It would be best}
{1015}{}{to compare them to the individual pages of a}
{1016}{}{construction manual. Four molecules provide the genetic}
{1017}{}{information; the so-called bases ?adenine, guanine,}
{1018}{}{cytosine and thymine, for simplification referred to by}
{1019}{}{their initial letters. The combination of these four}
{1020}{}{letters of the Alphabet of Life gives rise to all}
{1021}{}{living things around us, including ourselves.}
{1022}{}{**END-PAR**}
{1023}{}{Every time a living cell divides itself, its}
{1024}{}{"blueprint" is copied by means of a rather complex}
{1025}{}{process, which provides for a precise transcription.}
{1026}{}{During this process, one pair of chromosomes may become}
{1027}{}{subject to a phenomenon called mitotic crossing-over.}
{1028}{}{This phenomenon is the reason why it is impossible for}
{1029}{}{two identical individuals to be created ?excessive}
{1030}{}{similitude of the genetic code is always to the}
{1031}{}{disadvantage of a species. When two identical}
{1032}{}{chromosomes cross over and an exchange of two identical}
{1033}{}{loci bearing genes of the same type takes place (we}
{1034}{}{call them different alleles of the same gene),}
{1035}{}{everything is in order. Problems start to occur when}
{1036}{}{chromosomes cross over incorrectly. Then, both}
{1037}{}{chromosomes receive a section they already possess and}
{1038}{}{lose a part of the "blueprint" ?which may lead to}
{1039}{}{fatal consequences, of course. Let us, for a moment,}
{1040}{}{imagine a situation when you have a house built}
{1041}{}{according to a construction plan featuring instructions}
{1042}{}{for two chimneys but none for a roof. Amusing, isnt}
{1043}{}{it? The problem is that here, we are talking about the}
{1044}{}{replication of organic and, yes, even human cells. So}
{1045}{}{if the nucleus of such a newly created cell contains a}
{1046}{}{blueprint with two nose structures but none for legs -}
{1047}{}{I think you get the idea.}
{1048}{}{**END-PAR**}
{1049}{}{Now, this may be shocking to you, but these mistakes}
{1050}{}{are quite common. The process of multiplying genetic}
{1051}{}{information is more complex than any other man-made}
{1052}{}{construction. Millions of structures with the size of}
{1053}{}{just a few molecules participate in it, and even though}
{1054}{}{the entire system of evolution is fine-tuned almost to}
{1055}{}{perfection, mistakes occur quite often. Luckily, there}
{1056}{}{are mechanisms in place to correct these errors, or at}
{1057}{}{least limit their expression. Groups of molecules exist}
{1058}{}{which we could call "handymen", which move along the}
{1059}{}{DNA strand repairing any issues they encounter.}
{1060}{}{Another important fact is that every human being}
{1061}{}{possesses two of each chromosome, whereby each}
{1062}{}{chromosome consists of two identical parts }}
{1063}{}{chromatids. Hence, each body cell contains four copies}
{1064}{}{of a given blueprint, even if in different versions.}
{1065}{}{Should one variant be erroneous, others can replace it.}
{1066}{}{It is as if you lost your construction plans for a}
{1067}{}{shingle roof and decided to build a metal roof instead.}
{1068}{}{**END-PAR**}
{1069}{}{In case this mechanism should fail as well, there still}
{1070}{}{is a last safety backup. I mentioned that these errors}
{1071}{}{in transcription occur quite often. Indeed, it is often}
{1072}{}{and if we consider a single individual, in the course}
{1073}{}{of just one day, several thousand of such errors occur}
{1074}{}{in their body. However, it is important to keep in mind}
{1075}{}{that on average, a human body comprises cells in}
{1076}{}{numbers reaching twenty digits! In this amount, the}
{1077}{}{several hundred transcriptions that result in}
{1078}{}{irreparable errors are easily overlooked. You may be}
{1079}{}{aware of the fact that even though each cell contains a}
{1080}{}{complete blueprint, it partakes in only a certain part}
{1081}{}{of the construction process. This means that if, say, a}
{1082}{}{"foot cell" loses its blueprint for the nose, it does}
{1083}{}{not matter ?it wouldnt use it anyway. The odds of an}
{1084}{}{error affecting the exact section of the blueprint used}
{1085}{}{by a given cell are very low.}
{1086}{}{**END-PAR**}
{1087}{}{However, as with all complex processes, here too we}
{1088}{}{find a large BUT. This issue is represented by human}
{1089}{}{sex cells ?the spermatozoa and the ovum. In their}
{1090}{}{development, which is far more complex than the}
{1091}{}{development of bodily (somatic) cells, they go through}
{1092}{}{a phase in which they possess only a single chromatid}
{1093}{}{of each type of chromosome ?i.e. all the plans, all}
{1094}{}{genetic information are not present in four copies but}
{1095}{}{merely once. The second half of each chromosome is}
{1096}{}{later produced according to this single sample, and the}
{1097}{}{sex cell is thus haploid. As soon as the sperm and the}
{1098}{}{ovum merge, a single cell is created carrying a full,}
{1099}{}{diploid number of chromosomes. Nevertheless, if an}
{1100}{}{error occurs in course of this delicate process and a}
{1101}{}{single chromatid is compromised, the error is carried}
{1102}{}{on. It is copied in the completion of the chromosome}
{1103}{}{and after the merging of sex cells, one half of the}
{1104}{}{genetic code of the embryo is already compromised.}
{1105}{}{Luckily, there still is the second half, the other two}
{1106}{}{sets of blueprints (which are equally identical). It}
{1107}{}{may however happen that the damaged allele, the}
{1108}{}{so-called defective gene, may become dominant and push}
{1109}{}{the original, intact version into submission (The}
{1110}{}{process defining the dominant and recessive versions of}
{1111}{}{a gene is largely governed by chance). In such a case,}
{1112}{}{the defective gene becomes directive for all future}
{1113}{}{copies, for all future cells originating from the}
{1114}{}{embryo. Should this happen, it is very bad, as all the}
{1115}{}{cells of the future body will have the correct}
{1116}{}{blueprint but it will be locked away, unused, and the}
{1117}{}{body will instead build according to the dominant,}
{1118}{}{albeit defective plan. And if cells responsible for}
{1119}{}{building a leg lack an active blueprint to build it,}
{1120}{}{they just wont build it at all.}
{1121}{}{**END-PAR**}
{1122}{}{This is the reason why mutants may come to be. In the}
{1123}{}{period when a human body is made up of just a single}
{1124}{}{pair of haploid cell or even by a single or several}
{1125}{}{hundred diploid cells, the odds of an error occurring}
{1126}{}{are the same as always, but any error will have}
{1127}{}{significant, even fatal effects. Such cases, however,}
{1128}{}{are rather rare. The transcription apparatus is}
{1129}{}{impossibly complex and may break down but under normal}
{1130}{}{circumstances this happens extremely rarely. If,}
{1131}{}{however, the equilibrium of a delicate system is}
{1132}{}{compromised, the probability of a defective gene being}
{1133}{}{created rises manifold. The physical processes that}
{1134}{}{lead to such imbalance and to the emergence of}
{1135}{}{defective genes are called mutation factors; the}
{1136}{}{chemical substances with this effect are then called}
{1137}{}{mutagens. Mutation factors, like for example strong}
{1138}{}{ionizing radiation, X-rays or extreme thermal shocks}
{1139}{}{are not circumstances we encounter on a daily basis, it}
{1140}{}{may however be beneficial to mention something in this}
{1141}{}{respect.}
{1142}{}{**END-PAR**}
{1143}{}{It is a generally known fact that hard radiation does}
{1144}{}{not bring too many benefits to our health, but the}
{1145}{}{reason why that may be is less known. Radiation affects}
{1146}{}{the human body in three ways. After radiation hits the}
{1147}{}{skin, the irradiated surface exhibits a rapid increase}
{1148}{}{in temperature and burns. These wounds resemble burn}
{1149}{}{wounds and are treated in the same way. Further, when}
{1150}{}{high-energy particles and waves penetrate tissues, they}
{1151}{}{cause spot burns and cell damage on a molecular level }}
{1152}{}{they destroy the cytoplasmic membrane, damage}
{1153}{}{secretion pathways, and degrade enzymes. This type of}
{1154}{}{damage usually kills the cell, but should this not be}
{1155}{}{the case, the cell is terminated by the third effect }}
{1156}{}{damage to the delicate nucleic matter. The radiation}
{1157}{}{particles hit molecular chains and knock individual}
{1158}{}{atoms out of them. A short exposition to}
{1159}{}{a concentrated beam of hard radiation is enough to}
{1160}{}{render vital genetic information useless, as it becomes}
{1161}{}{full of gaps. A cell affected in this manner is no}
{1162}{}{longer able to synthesize important substances and soon}
{1163}{}{dies. It may, however, happen that the dose of}
{1164}{}{radiation is not lethal, which means that the damage it}
{1165}{}{causes does not lead to a demise of the cell. It may}
{1166}{}{continue to reproduce and live on but the damage to its}
{1167}{}{nucleus will result in a defect. Dysfunctions of}
{1168}{}{internal cellular processes thus give rise to some}
{1169}{}{somatic mutation.}
{1170}{}{**END-PAR**}
{1171}{}{Mutagens were discovered during the Second World War,}
{1172}{}{in 1943, during research on war gasses. Due to their}
{1173}{}{aggressive composition, these substances cause an}
{1174}{}{irregular crossing-over. They impact cell division and}
{1175}{}{the copying of genetic information, insert defective}
{1176}{}{molecules into new genes, and deprive and deperidinate}
{1177}{}{the DNA string, cracking individual "letters" out of}
{1178}{}{it. Alkylating agents are considered to be}
{1179}{}{super-mutagens. As far as more common substances go,}
{1180}{}{cigarette smoke, some solvents, and benzene are}
{1181}{}{mutagenic.}
{1182}{}{**END-PAR**}
{1183}{}{There is a third mutagenic agent ?viral diseases. When}
{1184}{}{a virus penetrates into a cell, it writes over a part}
{1185}{}{of its code by its own, just as computer viruses do.}
{1186}{}{With time, the virus destroys its host cell and moves}
{1187}{}{on to the next one. But it may happen that a viral}
{1188}{}{infection suddenly subsides. Viruses multiplying inside}
{1189}{}{the cell change and stop harming it, or further}
{1190}{}{replication may even be halted. The cell survives but}
{1191}{}{its genetic code is damaged. Some sections are missing,}
{1192}{}{others are shifted and there may even be completely new}
{1193}{}{sections created by the virus. This might lead to}
{1194}{}{completely unexpected mutations the forms of which}
{1195}{}{depend on the specific type of virus and the section of}
{1196}{}{the DNA string it attacked. Still, even these mutations}
{1197}{}{originating in viral infection are rather rare, and}
{1198}{}{normally not expressed. You really need not worry that}
{1199}{}{the common flu would cause you to turn into some kind}
{1200}{}{of monster.}
{1201}{}{**END-PAR**}
{1202}{}{Recently, there has been speculations concerning the}
{1203}{}{treatment of these mutations. The most diverse}
{1204}{}{procedures have been proposed, all of them reeking of}
{1205}{}{quack medicine. Consider what I just wrote concerning}
{1206}{}{the origin of mutations and you must inadvertently come}
{1207}{}{to the same conclusion. The medication would have to}
{1208}{}{penetrate into all cells, mysteriously find out what is}
{1209}{}{damaged (forget about the fact that damaged as well as}
{1210}{}{healthy sections have the same base content, just}
{1211}{}{ordered differently) and repair it. This is utterly}
{1212}{}{impossible. Not just impossible as far as the current}
{1213}{}{state of science, goes but impossible on principle.}
{1214}{}{**END-PAR**}
{1215}{}{And that is all. I believe I presented a clear and}
{1216}{}{relevantly complex image of the issue of mutation, but}
{1217}{}{you still have to understand that this is just an}
{1218}{}{overview of a topic of infinite complexity, as it}
{1219}{}{treats the very nature of the most amazing and most}
{1220}{}{complex process in the universe ?life.}

{2000}{}{Just as we are ready for other dangers that threaten}
{2001}{}{us daily, we must also be ready for the danger of a}
{2002}{}{nuclear attack. We know what to do when there is a fire}
{2003}{}{or when someone is injured, but what do we do when an}
{2004}{}{atomic bomb explodes?}
{2005}{}{Let us hope it never happens - but if it does, we must}
{2006}{}{be ready. The explosion of an atomic bomb is so}
{2007}{}{powerful it can rip up trees, destroy houses, or break}
{2008}{}{all the windows; and it can burn you far more than}
{2009}{}{falling asleep while sunbathing. That is why it is}
{2010}{}{important to know what to do if it happens.}
{2011}{}{It all depends on what kind of an attack it is - with}
{2012}{}{warning or without warning.}
{2013}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2014}{}{Civil Defense is working hard to do all it can to warn}
{2015}{}{us of an atomic bomb before it goes off. When they}
{2016}{}{detect danger approaching, the sound of sirens will}
{2017}{}{warn you, wherever you are. When you hear these sirens,}
{2018}{}{you must head to a vault assigned to you right away.}
{2019}{}{Wherever you are, whatever you are doing, you must}
{2020}{}{stop and immediately go to your vault.}
{2021}{}{It is important to head to the vault that has been}
{2022}{}{assigned to you by the Office of Civil Defense. Only in}
{2023}{}{this way can we ensure a safe number of people will be}
{2024}{}{in each vault. Remember your vault well, because you}
{2025}{}{will not be allowed to enter a vault that is not yours,}
{2026}{}{no matter what happens. Failing to remember your vault}
{2027}{}{puts your life, and the lives of your fellow citizens,}
{2028}{}{in danger.}
{2029}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2030}{}{If you cannot find your vault, it is best to ask the}
{2031}{}{nearest Civil Defense worker and obey his orders. Civil}
{2032}{}{Defense workers know what to do and are doing all they}
{2033}{}{can for our safety - your safety.}
{2034}{}{We are conducting exercises to ensure a quick and easy}
{2035}{}{evacuation of all citizens into vaults in case of}
{2036}{}{danger, so you should already know where to find your}
{2037}{}{vault and what to do. Please, do not underestimate the}
{2038}{}{importance of these exercises - they are done for your}
{2039}{}{own safety. And you never know if this time, God}
{2040}{}{forbid, the threat might be real.}
{2041}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2042}{}{In an extreme case, it is possible that the bombs will}
{2043}{}{explode without any warning. The first thing we would}
{2044}{}{notice would be a bright flash, brighter than the Sun,}
{2045}{}{brighter than anything you have ever seen. If you see}
{2046}{}{it, you must quickly duck and cover, no matter what you}
{2047}{}{are doing; there is no time to wait or look around. It}
{2048}{}{is important to remain in that position until the}
{2049}{}{danger passes. If you can, duck under a table and cover}
{2050}{}{the back of your head, just to be sure. If you are in a}
{2051}{}{room without tables or in a corridor, duck and cover}
{2052}{}{tight against the closest wall. Try to lie down away}
{2053}{}{from windows and doors with glass, because the glass}
{2054}{}{could hurt you if it breaks. If you are on the bus, do}
{2055}{}{not wait: duck into the aisle between the seats, far}
{2056}{}{from windows, so the glass does not cut you.}
{2057}{}{The atomic bomb can fall when you are outside. It does}
{2058}{}{not matter where you are or what you are doing, it is}
{2059}{}{important to duck and cover right away. It is best to}
{2060}{}{duck against the closest wall, but if there is no wall}
{2061}{}{around, duck on the ground and cover your head with}
{2062}{}{clothing or at least your hands. Even a newspaper may}
{2063}{}{protect you from severe burns.}

{2065}{}{It does not matter if we live in the city or the}

{8062}{}{across the wasteland. We fought the super mutants many}
{8063}{}{times. We killed many of them, but many brave Hunters}
{8064}{}{died as well.}
{8065}{}{**END-PAR**}
{8066}{}{Thanks to our efforts, the super mutants stopped}
{8067}{}{appearing in our territory and remained far in the}
{8068}{}{west. But then a new menace appeared - the Rebirth.}
{8069}{}{The Rebirth is some new religion that spread amongst}
{8070}{}{the ghouls, and they, armed with the best weapons}
{8071}{}{people had created before the war, started to pillage}
{8072}{}{towns and villages. We don't know where they got such}
{8073}{}{equipment, or anything about their foolish faith. The}
{8074}{}{ghouls talk only of someone called Savior, no doubt}
{8075}{}{another disgusting mutant. Not only do they kill in his}
{8076}{}{name, they also capture pure humans and take them}
{8077}{}{away, but we don't know where or why.}
{8078}{}{So we continued to look for pre-war technology, as well}
{8079}{}{as new allies. We found both in the only city that}
{8080}{}{resisted the Rebirth in the area. Or at least we}
{8081}{}{thought so. We came to Albuquerque, the city that had}
{8082}{}{already endured a large ghoul attack, and offer our}
{8083}{}{help and an alliance. But we were refused, offered only}
{8084}{}{a twisted agreement concluded in 2157. In return for}
{8085}{}{defending Albuquerque against the invaders, we were}
{8086}{}{allowed to eradicate the threat within the city! They}
{8087}{}{"graciously" gave us the permission to purge the city}
{8088}{}{of mutants, when it should've been their natural duty}
{8089}{}{as pure humans! And all we received was the minimum}
{8090}{}{material required for the construction of our base.}
{8091}{}{People of the empire, blinded by their easy lives,}
{8092}{}{didn't realize what threat the Rebirth really was. And}
{8093}{}{not only the Rebirth, but all mutants.}
{8094}{}{**END-PAR**}
{8095}{}{In 2160, many dwellers paid for their foolishness with}
{8096}{}{their lives. The ghouls mustered enough strength for a}
{8097}{}{second large attack on the city. Without tactics or}
{8098}{}{reason, they ferociously threw themselves at}
{8099}{}{Albuquerque. Their better weapons and especially their}
{8100}{}{numerical superiority allowed them to penetrate deep}
{8101}{}{into the city. While confusion spread amongst the}
{8102}{}{imperial soldiers, we Mutant Hunters eventually forced}
{8103}{}{the ghouls to retreat. But not even after our triumph}
{8104}{}{did the emperor offer us the technology and equipment}
{8105}{}{that they have amply available. The only thing he}
{8106}{}{agreed with was the construction of a wall around the}
{8107}{}{entire city. There was plenty of material available.}
{8108}{}{Not only from around the city, but especially from the}
{8109}{}{ruins that remained after the ghoul invasion. That}
{8110}{}{destroyed part of the city has been called the Dead}
{8111}{}{Quarter ever since.}
{8112}{}{**END-PAR**}
{8113}{}{Our relentless search across the wasteland finally bore}
{8114}{}{fruit in 2161. We discovered an old army warehouse, and}
{8115}{}{turned it into our second base. Thanks to its excellent}
{8116}{}{location, it remains hidden from the Rebirth patrols}
{8117}{}{that frequently appear in the area. Thus, we don't have}
{8118}{}{to take the captured ghouls far, and especially not}
{8119}{}{into a city that we strive to keep clean from mutants.}
{8120}{}{That's why the base, headed by commander Tunrida, is}
{8121}{}{mostly use for interrogations and conducting tests on}
{8122}{}{the mutants.}
{8123}{}{**END-PAR**}
{8124}{}{In 2166, we finally took at least a part of what}
{8125}{}{rightfully belongs to us. We defend Albuquerque from}
{8126}{}{mutants both inside and outside, and the empire still}
{8127}{}{refuses to help us. We defend their lives, as well as}
{8128}{}{the lives of all pure humans, and they refuse to give}
{8129}{}{us the technology that would be of incredible help not}
{8130}{}{only in our fight against the Rebirth, but all the}
{8131}{}{mutants! That's why we took the third floor of their}
{8132}{}{Vault by force. We used killers genetically engineered}
{8133}{}{by pre-war scientists to capture the floor without the}
{8134}{}{empire suspecting a thing. The emperor responded to the}
{8135}{}{loss of the two floors of their Vault by shutting the}
{8136}{}{Imperial City off from the rest of Albuquerque, proving}
{8137}{}{that there was no one capable of sensible leadership}
{8138}{}{among the descendants of the Vault 16 dwellers.}

{10024}{}{The respiratory system is similar to that of birds, in}
{10025}{}{addition to two lung lobes, it also contains rear lung}

{10034}{}{The digestive system consists of two stomachs, a}

{10042}{}{The nervous system is tubular, the same as in}

{10045}{}{very few creases. Telencephalon is stunted, however,}
{10046}{}{with the exception of one frontal lobe, which is}
{10047}{}{unusually large. The function of this section is not}
{10048}{}{entirely clear yet, however, we found a very strong}

{10060}{}{discoveries in the field of genetics.}
{10061}{}{**END-PAR**}
{10062}{}{Microbiochemical analysis:}
{10063}{}{**END-PAR**}
{10064}{}{From the viewpoint of genetics, the alien completely}
{10065}{}{surpasses everything we know. Its hereditary}
{10066}{}{information is stored in what might be called the penta}
{10067}{}{alpha helix - a helix made of five primary strips of}
{10068}{}{its own ribonucleic acid. This DNA is supplemented by a}
{10069}{}{quantity of completely unknown proteins. The histones}
{10070}{}{keeping the whole structure together are extremely}
{10071}{}{complex and yet stable. The molecular structure is}
{10072}{}{simply amazing. The diffused cores contain five pairs}
{10073}{}{of chromosomes, which are relatively short and make the}
{10074}{}{same sense when read from either side. This creates a}
{10075}{}{sort of secondary failsafe, so the chances of fatal}
{10076}{}{damage to the code is eight times less than in normal}
{10077}{}{organisms. We haven't found any parasitic DNA during}
{10078}{}{sequencing, unless we count long stretches coding the}
{10079}{}{transcription of various enzymes, however, the alien}
{10080}{}{does not use these under normal conditions. We assume}
{10081}{}{that these grecipesh allow aliens to adapt to a}
{10082}{}{variety of external conditions extremely quickly. After}
{10083}{}{being brought into a foreign environment, these}
{10084}{}{creatures can fully adapt within a single generation.}
{10085}{}{**END-PAR**}
{10086}{}{All of this confirms my original assumption that aliens}
{10087}{}{are not a natural species modified by breeding and}
{10088}{}{selection, and certainly are not mutants that occurred}
{10089}{}{naturally. This is a creature created completely from}
{10090}{}{scratch. An artificial organism. An organic machine.}
{10091}{}{For what purpose was it created?}
{10092}{}{The answer to the question can be found by observing}
{10093}{}{the captured aliens. They are willing and able to}
{10094}{}{attack anything that disrupts their territory. During}
{10095}{}{experiments with a deathclaw in the open terrarium, the}
{10096}{}{deathclaw was victorious, but when he proceeded further}
{10097}{}{into the alien lair, it was torn to pieces. The aliens}
{10098}{}{are able to perfectly coordinate their moves, even}
{10099}{}{though we did not detect any usual forms of}
{10100}{}{communication among them. Although they can perfectly}
{10101}{}{orientate themselves in both light and dark, they seem}
{10102}{}{to prefer darkness, apparently to help cool their}
{10103}{}{oversized organism. However, they don't seem to mind}
{10104}{}{heat at all! The overall structure of their bodies}
{10105}{}{makes them almost perfect killers. What is missing to}
{10106}{}{complete perfection is caused by the concessions needed}
{10107}{}{to ensure reproduction. The aliens are gonochoric. The}
{10108}{}{mother, also called the Queen, is larger than the}
{10109}{}{males. The Queen, after mating with one of the males,}
{10110}{}{lays a large number of eggs. The Queen can keep viable}
{10111}{}{sperm in special pockets and maintain them for a very}
{10112}{}{long period of time, this way she can lay fertilized}
{10113}{}{eggs long after seeing the last male. The sex of the}
{10114}{}{offspring isn't genetically determined, but further}
{10115}{}{details are not yet known.}
{10116}{}{**END-PAR**}
{10117}{}{It is likely that the aliens were created before the}
{10118}{}{War as killing machines for the army. They've more than}
{10119}{}{proven themselves in that role, even in these times,}
{10120}{}{however, we do not currently recommend their use. The}
{10121}{}{pre-war scientists managed to build into them only one}
{10122}{}{control mechanism, a so called "genetic clock". As we}
{10123}{}{have already stated, the alien's genome is grouped in}
{10124}{}{ten chromosomes. That is not entirely accurate, as}
{10125}{}{there is one extra (non-paired!) short chromosome. Due}
{10126}{}{to the influence of hormones contained in the male}
{10127}{}{sexual secretions, there is an expression of genes on}
{10128}{}{this otherwise non-functioning chromosome after mating.}
{10129}{}{Though this only happens in the primordial gonocytes of}
{10130}{}{the embryonic tissue, it happens in all of them at}
{10131}{}{once! These chemical reactions are not yet fully}
{10132}{}{clarified. The microchromosome is composed of three}
{10133}{}{parts: The first (in front of the centriola) creates}
{10134}{}{depended RNA polymerase, which than cuts off a small}
{10135}{}{(but always the same sized) part of the chromatin on}
{10136}{}{the opposite end of the microchromosome. The third part}
{10137}{}{of the microchromosome is firmly connected to the}
{10138}{}{second part, but unlike it, it is nonsensical. The}
{10139}{}{order of the bases has no purpose and renders the code}
{10140}{}{in the second, middle section of microchromosome}
{10141}{}{inactive. However, during each division, a part of this}
{10142}{}{meaningless section is cut off until there is none}
{10143}{}{left, causing the second part to become active and}
{10144}{}{immediately begin its expression. Its result is}
{10145}{}{cellular death. This means that after a set (hard-wired}
{10146}{}{in advance!) number of divisions (followed by the}
{10147}{}{creation of eggs), all the cells of the embryonal line}
{10148}{}{commit mass suicide and the queen becomes sterile. The}
{10149}{}{old world scientists probably did this because they}
{10150}{}{thought it would ensure that the aliens wouldn't breed}
{10151}{}{uncontrollably in case of an escape. I consider this}
{10152}{}{failsafe to be extremely effective, though theories}
{10153}{}{have appeared that tried to prove it's potential}
{10154}{}{inefficacy under extreme conditions, but the hypotheses}
{10155}{}{were found to be improbable.}
{10156}{}{There are no other apparent means of controlling the}
{10157}{}{aliens. Training them is impossible at the current}
{10158}{}{state of our knowledge. They're like an unguided}
{10159}{}{nuclear missile, you release them and who knows where}
{10160}{}{they'll fall. However, there were indications that}
{10161}{}{pointed to the possibility of changing that fact. It}
{10162}{}{seems very likely that in the future, after more}
{10163}{}{advanced research is done, we will be able to}
{10164}{}{understand the structure of the alien brains and use}
{10165}{}{this knowledge to control them. Though it will require}
{10166}{}{long and arduous effort from the entire science team,}

{12027}{}{After four hours and 22 minutes of interrogation, the}

{12038}{}{Of course, mutants cannot really become truly pure}
{12039}{}{humans, not even such advanced pre-war technology can}
{12040}{}{do the impossible. The transformation is only}

{13000}{}{Since the first attacks of the Rebirth, our forces have}
{13001}{}{faced a hostile army equipped with highly resistant}
{13002}{}{armor, including powered infantry armor (model T-51b).}
{13003}{}{This raises the need to increase the effectiveness of}
{13004}{}{our weapons against these advanced protective}
{13005}{}{measures. One of the possible directions is the}
{13006}{}{development of pulse weapons, thus, we began to}
{13007}{}{examine the issue of development and production of}
{13008}{}{these high-energy systems. Analysis of the YK32 pistol,}
{13009}{}{of which we've had several pieces in our armory since}
{13010}{}{the war, has served as the basis for this research.}
{13011}{}{**END-PAR**}
{13012}{}{The pulse weapon from the Yuma Flats Energy Consortium}
{13013}{}{is characterized by solid construction and high}
{13014}{}{performance. It is quite notable for its unique}
{13015}{}{cigar-like shape and three distinct cooling ribs. The}
{13016}{}{gun fits very well into the hand, as the pistol grip,}
{13017}{}{where the batteries are hidden, is considerably heavier}
{13018}{}{than the rest of the weapon, which basically only}
{13019}{}{consists of light electronics hidden in chassis made of}
{13020}{}{non-magnetic metals. The electronics in this pistol are}
{13021}{}{made with amazing precision. Secondary and tertiary}
{13022}{}{converters are characterized by an unusually high}
{13023}{}{efficiency, and the primary energy circuits of the}
{13024}{}{weapons are also designed in original, efficient style}
{13025}{}{- after all, this gun has only three cooling ribs. The}
{13026}{}{residual heat generated by a system of particle}
{13027}{}{accelerators is very small and the weapon does not}
{13028}{}{appear to have the tendency to overheat even after}
{13029}{}{many consecutive shots. However, the downside of this}
{13030}{}{performance is lower accuracy. The gun has only one}
{13031}{}{radiation rectifier battery. It was simply not possible}
{13032}{}{to fit more of them into the weapon. When firing from a}
{13033}{}{greater distance, the pistol thus suffers from a}
{13034}{}{considerable dispersion. Along the same line, it also}
{13035}{}{suffers from a problem, or rather is the victim of the}
{13036}{}{overall design, which is inadequate capacity,}
{13037}{}{sufficient for just five shots.}
{13038}{}{**END-PAR**}
{13039}{}{Despite the novel solution of the model YK32 structure,}
{13040}{}{it's obvious that it's not possible to concentrate all}
{13041}{}{the necessary systems (i.e. pulse field generators,}
{13042}{}{radiation rectifiers, cooling systems, feedback}
{13043}{}{eliminators, power accumulators) into a small}
{13044}{}{one-handed weapon that would be simple to operate but}
{13045}{}{would be of sufficient combat value to us. Low range}
{13046}{}{and small energy capacity seem to be the critical}
{13047}{}{factors. The pulse weapon itself needs to be designed}
{13048}{}{from the beginning as a large two-handed rifle of}
{13049}{}{generous design, one that is able to contain everything}
{13050}{}{that needs to be there. This will make it possible to}
{13051}{}{significantly increase the efficiency of the weapon.}
{13052}{}{**END-PAR**}
{13053}{}{As for the structural elements, it is worth trying to}
{13054}{}{emulate the design of the YK32 primary circuits. The}
{13055}{}{particle generators can be taken over without problems,}
{13056}{}{and thinking of something better may not even be}
{13057}{}{possible. The original diagnostic and regulatory}
{13058}{}{mechanisms are also suitable. However, the feedback}
{13059}{}{elimination systems will be more complicated. Adapting}
{13060}{}{the systems from the pistol to the higher power of the}
{13061}{}{rifle may be problematic, on the other hand, the higher}
{13062}{}{mass of the body of the weapon will be very helpful}
{13063}{}{here. As for the accumulator, charging, and}
{13064}{}{transformation systems, it will be best to adapt them}
{13065}{}{from the creations of the Winchester company, as they}
{13066}{}{are more massive and can handle higher energy values}
{13067}{}{than the delicate Yuma Flats accumulators. We will have}
{13068}{}{to develop the targeting electronics (which the YK32}
{13069}{}{completely lacks) ourselves, or stick with the system}
{13070}{}{developed near the end of the war by Wattz Electronics.}
{13071}{}{The development of our own targeting system will of}
{13072}{}{course take several months. On the other hand, the}
{13073}{}{Watzz Electronics system may not be fully compatible}
{13074}{}{with the rectifiers and the generators of the pulse}
{13075}{}{field. It will be necessary to carry out a more}
{13076}{}{thorough research in this regard.}

{13078}{}{The development of the pulse rifle will no doubt take a}
{13079}{}{long time, and its manufacture will require a}
{13080}{}{significant amount of resources. However, the empire}
{13081}{}{already possesses the necessary materials. If we choose}
{13082}{}{to go in the direction of pulse technology, the}
{13083}{}{resulting weapon could be superior to all other}
{13084}{}{personal weapons both from the purely technological}
{13085}{}{side and for its tactical combat value.}

{14000}{}{In the period after the opening of the vault and the}
{14001}{}{subsequent resettlement of the surface, our military}
{14002}{}{encountered numerous hostile groups. Our trained and}
{14003}{}{disciplined soldiers handled every tribal and raider}
{14004}{}{attack, as well as attacks by mutated animals. However,}
{14005}{}{in order to ensure greater security and to unify the}
{14006}{}{representative look of the imperial army, the}
{14007}{}{development of a new, unified element of personal}
{14008}{}{defense began.}
{14009}{}{**END-PAR**}
{14010}{}{The basic requirements that shaped our ideas were high}
{14011}{}{resistance to explosions and fired projectiles, low}
{14012}{}{production costs and the possibility of serial}
{14013}{}{production in large quantities. The concept of a system}
{14014}{}{of anatomically shaped metal plates worn over one's}
{14015}{}{clothes appeared ideal for this. Such armor had to be}
{14016}{}{designed to avoid impeding the movement of the wearer}
{14017}{}{while still offering maximum protection.}
{14018}{}{**END-PAR**}
{14019}{}{For the creation of the corpus, a quarter inch of}
{14020}{}{high-quality boiler steel was used, reinforced with an}
{14021}{}{additional welded layer on the chest and back. Flexible}
{14022}{}{components are made of fifty layers of kevlar fibers,}
{14023}{}{and clamping elements are made up of strong brahmin}
{14024}{}{leather. The inner lining of the the armor is made up}
{14025}{}{of ten layers of nomex. The armor is welded, the moving}
{14026}{}{metal components are connected with screws, and the}
{14027}{}{fabric and leather are riveted to the metal.}
{14028}{}{**END-PAR**}
{14029}{}{Practical tests have shown that the armor provides}
{14030}{}{complete protection for the chest, shoulders and back}
{14031}{}{against both stabbing and cutting attacks. The new}
{14032}{}{armor also seems highly effective against the commonly}
{14033}{}{used soft-core ammunition. The kevlar parts are of}
{14034}{}{course ineffective against piercing ammo shot from}
{14035}{}{shorter range. The imperial soldiers are trained to}
{14036}{}{fully understand this limitation. The option of}
{14037}{}{multiplying the layer of fibers was rejected due to}
{14038}{}{limited supplies of pre-war materials. In the case of}
{14039}{}{deploying the armor against military weapons using}
{14040}{}{armor-piercing ammunition, the survival of the wearer}
{14041}{}{cannot be guaranteed. But weapons of this kind are}
{14042}{}{quite rare in the wasteland.}
{14043}{}{**END-PAR**}
{14044}{}{Using nomex and kevlar fibers for the construction of}
{14045}{}{the lining and stomach protection proved to be an}
{14046}{}{excellent decision during the tests. Fabric made from}
{14047}{}{the combination of these fibers gives the armor a}
{14048}{}{phenomenal resistance to explosions incomparable to}
{14049}{}{regular metal armor. Even in the case of exposure to}
{14050}{}{the effects of relatively powerful explosives during}
{14051}{}{testing, the volunteers only complained about losing}
{14052}{}{their breath. Besides the resistance of the pre-war}
{14053}{}{fabrics against explosions and shrapnel, we must also}
{14054}{}{mention their excellent resistance against fire. The}
{14055}{}{armor as a whole is capable of resisting exposure to}
{14056}{}{temperatures of up to 600 degrees Fahrenheit.}
{14057}{}{**END-PAR**}
{14058}{}{The metal armor with nomex-kevlar fiber has proven}
{14059}{}{itself to be a suitable armor for the imperial army. It}
{14060}{}{has saved the lives of many heroic soldiers. Each man}
{14061}{}{or woman in active service is assigned a suit of it.}
{14062}{}{Due to the excellent results and so far sufficient}
{14063}{}{stocks of material, it will stay in production for at}
{14064}{}{least a few more years.}

{15000}{}{Vault-Tec Biological Research Complex - New Mexico}
{15001}{}{**END-PAR**}
{15002}{}{To satisfy the growing research potential of Vault-Tec,}
{15003}{}{in 2047 we began the construction of a six floor}
{15004}{}{complex in New Mexico, and its construction was}
{15005}{}{finished four years later. All current research and}
{15006}{}{development on biology and other related fields was}
{15007}{}{moved here, but we also started new projects for which}
{15008}{}{we did not have capacity before.}
{15009}{}{The project with the highest priority was creating an}
{15010}{}{effective treatment for radiation exposure and}
{15011}{}{mutation, as another possible stage in rebuilding}
{15012}{}{civilization after a possible nuclear war. Thus began}
{15013}{}{the most demanding project in the history of the}
{15014}{}{company, surpassing in complexity even the successful}
{15015}{}{GECK project. There is no doubt that it will take many}
{15016}{}{more years, and will require much effort before the}
{15017}{}{project reaches the planned result.}
{15018}{}{A department for manufacturing basic Vault equipment}
{15019}{}{(such as jumpsuits and Pip-Boys) was also built in the}
{15020}{}{complex, as its convenient geographical location}
{15021}{}{permits the easily distribution of goods to vaults in}
{15022}{}{the west and south of the USA.}
{15023}{}{Three years of smooth operation have shown that the}
{15024}{}{facility has enough free space and capacity. Part of}
{15025}{}{the capacity was freed up by finishing some of the}
{15026}{}{smaller projects. This made it possible to begin}
{15027}{}{developing weapons in close cooperation with the United}
{15028}{}{States' Army. Considering the nature of the local}

{15032}{}{The complex is completely self-sufficient, just like a}

{15036}{}{from a tactical nuclear missile. The main power source}
{15037}{}{is a massive nuclear reactor near the bottom of the}
{15038}{}{complex, on the sixth floor. This cutting-edge reactor}
{15039}{}{guarantees smooth operation for several decades.}
{15040}{}{Besides modern technologies and lab equipment, the}

{16005}{}{required. However, its negative side-effects,}
{16006}{}{manifesting mere minutes after being administered, were}
{16007}{}{responsible for permanent organ damage and, in some}
{16008}{}{cases, even the death of many soldiers. For these}
{16009}{}{reasons, we have received a contract from the United}
{16010}{}{States Armed Forces for a medication with greater}
{16011}{}{healing power which retains none of these inopportune}
{16012}{}{characteristics. This new medication has been named}
{16013}{}{ultra stimpak.}
{16014}{}{**END-PAR**}
{16015}{}{An increase in healing potency was easily accomplished}
{16016}{}{by increasing the volume of alpha-fibrinogen and}
{16017}{}{hydroxyproline contained in each dose. As expected,}
{16018}{}{testing confirmed that these ratios are hazardous to}
{16019}{}{humans, with a single dose proving sufficient to}
{16020}{}{provoke a cardiac arrest in susceptible individuals. As}
{16021}{}{a result, our laboratories began developing a mixture}
{16022}{}{of suppressors and calcium ion emitters which, when}
{16023}{}{combined with basic proteins, should mitigate the ultra}
{16024}{}{stimpak's undesirable side-effects without impacting}
{16025}{}{its healing ability. Batch 5-003 managed to reduce the}
{16026}{}{potency of the side-effects, while 5-018 blocked them}
{16027}{}{completely. However, more thorough testing later}
{16028}{}{revealed that ultra stimpak's effective service life}
{16029}{}{was limited to two or three weeks at most. After that}
{16030}{}{time, chemical decomposition occurs, weakening the}
{16031}{}{effect of molecular markers. Tropocollagen structures}
{16032}{}{then manifest, as in batch 5-003, or lead to the}
{16033}{}{collapse of control mechanisms with fatal consequences}
{16034}{}{- as seen with the super stimpak. Further development}
{16035}{}{was consequently focused on the stricter control of}
{16036}{}{glycoprotein distribution, especially using synthetic}
{16037}{}{fullerene-based nanocapsules. Research in this area has}
{16038}{}{progressed our understanding of macromolecules}
{16039}{}{considerably. When the lab produced batch 9-012, it}
{16040}{}{felt more like a by-product than an end-goal. The}
{16041}{}{results of our research will change the future of}
{16042}{}{pharmacology. Batch 9-012 resembles a perfect,}
{16043}{}{subcellular clockwork mechanism. It can quickly heal}
{16044}{}{even severe injuries, yet possesses none of the}
{16045}{}{negative side-effects of our previous efforts. The}
{16046}{}{overall lifetime of the macromolecules used is}
{16047}{}{estimated to be 120 years - which should prove more}
{16048}{}{than sufficient.}

{16050}{}{At present, we have already begun mass producing ultra}
{16051}{}{stimpaks. We should be able to supply all elite and}
{16052}{}{special units of the United States Armed Forces during}
{16053}{}{the year 2077, and all other military branches within}
{16054}{}{the next two or three years. We estimate that ultra}

{18016}{}{When living on the surface became impossible, the}

{18018}{}{vault numbered 16. That way, they saved themselves}
{18019}{}{from the radioactive fallout and were given the}
{18020}{}{opportunity to repopulate the Earth again in the}
{18021}{}{future. However, that hope could've been lost because}
{18022}{}{of a great dispute that erupted in the shelter. Because}
{18023}{}{of a gross administrative error, not one, but two}
{18024}{}{overseers were charged with the leadership of the}
{18025}{}{Vault. Elizabeth Stillson and Abraham Harding, a woman}
{18026}{}{and a man, both appointed to the same office. Each of}
{18027}{}{them supported by their subordinates and a large part}
{18028}{}{of ordinary people, neither willing to stand down.}
{18029}{}{Conflict seemed inevitable. But the overseers were wise}
{18030}{}{rulers and came up with a way to prevent unnecessary}
{18031}{}{bloodshed - they decided to appease the entire Vault by}
{18032}{}{marrying each other. That way they could both manage}

{18035}{}{During their wedding, they signed an agreement and}
{18036}{}{peace, welcomed with enthusiasm by everyone, had taken}
{18037}{}{hold in the Vault. That's how the united}
{18038}{}{Harding-Stillson family came to rule, consisting of}
{18039}{}{both first overseers and their closest relatives.}
{18040}{}{Together they looked after the welfare of the}

{18046}{}{The Establishment of the Empire}
{18047}{}{After six decades spent in the Vault, the land became}
{18048}{}{habitable again, and Theodor, the overseer at the time}
{18049}{}{and the grandson of the first overseers, decided it was}
{18050}{}{time to resettle it. A difficult period of rebuilding}
{18051}{}{began, as the dwellers had to transform the ruins of}
{18052}{}{the old metropolis of Albuquerque into their new home.}
{18053}{}{Many demanding tasks awaited them. They learned the}
{18054}{}{practical use of old world technology, defended their}
{18055}{}{emerging city from enemy attacks, and made contacts}
{18056}{}{with the surrounding settlements. Overseer Theodor}
{18057}{}{wisely led them and always showed them the path they}
{18058}{}{needed to take. When eleven years had passed, he}
{18059}{}{considered his work complete and decided to pass the}
{18060}{}{rule to the people. However, they knew how much}
{18061}{}{Theodor did for them, and how important it was for him}
{18062}{}{to lead the City in the future as well. That's why they}
{18063}{}{declined his abdication. On the contrary, they came}
{18064}{}{with a proposal that would strengthen Theodor's}
{18065}{}{position even more. To show their appreciation for his}
{18066}{}{tremendous merits and to make sure the rule stays in}
{18067}{}{the hands of his descendants, they looked at the}
{18068}{}{examples from the old world, where they learned about}
{18069}{}{the title of emperor. Because the powers and majesty of}
{18070}{}{this position proved to be exactly what they wanted}
{18071}{}{for Theodor, they decided to award that title to him.}
{18072}{}{Internally, Theodor was against this, but he didn't}
{18073}{}{want to oppose the will of the people. That's why he}
{18074}{}{accepted the position. But he insisted that, at least,}
{18075}{}{a council with three members be created that would rule}
{18076}{}{together with him. That's how the empire and the}
{18077}{}{council of advisers were established. On the request of}
{18078}{}{the dwellers, only people from the Harding-Stillson}

{18090}{}{huge number of disciplined ghouls armed to the teeth,}
{18091}{}{bent on ransacking it completely. Despite the surprise}
{18092}{}{of their attack, the imperial army was able to quickly}
{18093}{}{organize itself and stop the ghoul onslaught. The}
{18094}{}{fierce battle lasted until dawn, and claimed many lives}
{18095}{}{of our best and most loyal troops. The ghouls were slow}
{18096}{}{to retreat at first, and tried several unsuccessful}
{18097}{}{counterattacks, but their retreat soon turned into a}
{18098}{}{cowardly escape and their army fell apart completely.}
{18099}{}{The imperial army was victorious. But because it lost}
{18100}{}{many men, and needed the rest for the direct defense of}
{18101}{}{the Imperial City, emperor Myzrael decided to negotiate}
{18102}{}{a contract with a faction called the Mutant Hunters. He}
{18103}{}{gave them the means to build their base in the vicinity}
{18104}{}{of the empire in return for a promise that they would}
{18105}{}{dispose of the ghoul threat. Originally, they asked for}
{18106}{}{much more in return for their services, from weapons to}
{18107}{}{the most advanced technologies of the City, but}
{18108}{}{Myzrael's deft negotiating prevented that. Sadly, the}
{18109}{}{Hunters are not too zealous in their task. During the}
{18110}{}{second ghoul attack seven years ago, they weren't even}

{18115}{}{managed to stop the ghoul army again. Then, with}
{18116}{}{negligible help from the Hunters, they managed to turn}
{18117}{}{them back and force the ghouls to retreat. The empire}

{19043}{}{and attacks him. The corporal starts firing on it but}
{19044}{}{the creature suffers no wounds from his light weapon.}
{19045}{}{It quickly, and with great agility, reaches the}
{19046}{}{corporal and kills him with its left tentacle. I order}
{19047}{}{Hudson and Vasquez to retreat immediately.}
{19048}{}{**END-PAR**}
{19049}{}{6:39 - The rest of the team manages to retreat into}
{19050}{}{the room across from the elevator without the predator}
{19051}{}{chasing them. After a brief radio communication, I}
{19052}{}{order them to head to the elevator and try to get into}
{19053}{}{the third floor. I task private Vasquez with attaching}
{19054}{}{the rope while private Hudson secures the corridor.}
{19055}{}{**END-PAR**}
{19056}{}{6:44 - Two more predators appear on the western end of}
{19057}{}{the corridor - one of them, judging by the slight}
{19058}{}{scratches on its body, is likely the attacker from the}
{19059}{}{previous encounter. Private Hudson initiates machine}
{19060}{}{gun fire and kills one of the creatures. However, the}
{19061}{}{second one manages to reach him and wrestles him to}
{19062}{}{the ground. At that moment, the video contact with him}
{19063}{}{is severed - private Hudson is most likely killed.}
{19064}{}{Private Vasquez manages to get to the elevator and go}
{19065}{}{down to the third floor.}
{19066}{}{**END-PAR**}
{19067}{}{6:47 - After private Vasquez descends, a shot is heard,}
{19068}{}{hitting him. He succumbs to his injuries almost}
{19069}{}{immediately. Before the connection is severed, it is}
{19070}{}{possible to see a defensive perimeter that was set up}
{19071}{}{there, as well as two armed men. Judging by their}
{19072}{}{equipment and badges, they were undoubtedly members}
{19073}{}{of the Mutant Hunters.}

{19075}{}{**END-PAR**}
{19076}{}{Despite the casualties, I deem the reconnaissance}

{20003}{}{With regards to the long-term loss of contact with the}
{20004}{}{second and third floors of Vault 16, as per given}
{20005}{}{order, I've created an operational group which was to}
{20006}{}{determine the status of the lost floors of the Vault}
{20007}{}{and prepare a plan to restore our control over them.}
{20008}{}{After seeing the image records from the lower floors,}
{20009}{}{which were recorded before the contact was interrupted,}
{20010}{}{I've deemed it necessary to get more information about}
{20011}{}{the situation in the Vault. Thus, I decided to form a}
{20012}{}{three-man reconnaissance team from the elite soldiers}
{20013}{}{of the empire - corporal Hicks and privates Hudson and}
{20014}{}{Vasquez. The team was instructed to inspect the status}
{20015}{}{of the lower floors of the Vault. Each member of the}
{20016}{}{team was equipped with the necessary technical}
{20017}{}{equipment to allow him to maintain radio and visual}
{20018}{}{contact during the mission. This allowed me to}
{20019}{}{simultaneously watch the entire operation and directly}
{20020}{}{intervene during the progress of the reconnaissance.}
{20021}{}{**END-PAR**}
{20022}{}{**END-PAR**}
{20023}{}{I've divided the progress of the reconnaissance mission}
{20024}{}{by time sequence for greater clarity:}
{20025}{}{**END-PAR**}
{20026}{}{6:30 - Start of the operation following the final}
{20027}{}{briefing. The team begins to descend to the second}
{20028}{}{floor.}
{20029}{}{**END-PAR**}
{20030}{}{6:34 - The team enters the second floor. The walls and}
{20031}{}{the floor are covered with a slimy matter of unknown}
{20032}{}{origin. The premises are visibly damaged, and most of}
{20033}{}{the devices do not work. I order the recon team to}
{20034}{}{scout the corridor and leisure quarters.}
{20035}{}{6:37 - An unidentified creature is spotted in the}
{20036}{}{resting area on the southwest of the floor. It is}
{20037}{}{approximately one meter tall and has dark purple skin}
{20038}{}{under a thin layer of slime. Judging by the upper limbs}
{20039}{}{- probably tentacles - and jaws, it is predatory. Its}
{20040}{}{appearance coincides with the profile of the creature}
{20041}{}{captured on record shortly before losing contact with}
{20042}{}{the lower floors. The creature registers corporal Hicks}
{20043}{}{and attacks him. The corporal starts firing on it but}

{21004}{}{My last day in command at the PROGEMA facility. Today,}
{21005}{}{we complete the closure of this base - from tomorrow,}
{21006}{}{there won't be a soul left. I hope I don't forget to}
{21007}{}{pack anything. The last few days have been turbulent.}
{21008}{}{Everyone is nervous, working hastily to complete their}
{21009}{}{tasks to the ludicrous deadlines being set for us. The}
{21010}{}{fact that our orders came from the President himself}
{21011}{}{did nothing to help people stay calm, either. I tried}
{21012}{}{finding out more about the reasons for suddenly}
{21013}{}{suspending all activity here, but to no avail. The only}
{21014}{}{thing I do know is we aren't the only ones ordered to}
{21015}{}{terminate their activity like this, with no questions}
{21016}{}{asked. I don't like it. When the Army interferes like}
{21017}{}{this, there is always something big cooking. When they}
{21018}{}{moved that large contingent of military hardware to}
{21019}{}{Alaska back in ?6, the next thing we knew we were at}
{21020}{}{war with China within a week. I don't even want to}
{21021}{}{think about what will happen this time.}
{21022}{}{**END-PAR**}
{21023}{}{I'm sincerely sorry we cannot continue our work. The}
{21024}{}{genetic manipulation project has shown progress and, in}
{21025}{}{my opinion, we are nearing the final breakthrough. Even}
{21026}{}{considering the concerns of some of our scientists -}
{21027}{}{that the definitive specimen may not be controllable -}
{21028}{}{we are definitely getting results. I think some of the}
{21029}{}{scientists allocated to the main project are simply}
{21030}{}{being overcautious. Not that I'll take the storage of}
{21031}{}{our subjects lightly - I will personally see that they}
{21032}{}{are placed safely in stasis. Regardless of any chaos}
{21033}{}{that might erupt here in the hours before closure,}
{21034}{}{subject storage is the one procedure we cannot afford}
{21035}{}{to get wrong. I believe that, in the event of an}
{21036}{}{escape, a subject would have no trouble punching}
{21037}{}{through even the sturdiest of this base's walls.}
{21038}{}{**END-PAR**}
{21039}{}{I'm not sure what is going to happen to the people}
{21040}{}{under my authority. The scientists are murmuring about}
{21041}{}{some large base in New Mexico, a supposed joint}
{21042}{}{undertaking being managed by the Army and Vault-Tec.}
{21043}{}{They hardly know the specifics - it seems like rumor}
{21044}{}{and hearsay to me. Hell, I don't even know exactly}
{21045}{}{where that base is located. The scientists are just}
{21046}{}{plain curious, hoping they might be assigned there, but}
{21047}{}{I know for a fact they're going to be stowed away}
{21048}{}{someplace safe. Maybe even inside the vaults. A handful}
{21049}{}{of the scientists assigned to our secondary project,}
{21050}{}{improving human characteristics, are supposed to begin}
{21051}{}{field-testing their results for the Secret Service.}
{21052}{}{Everything is top secret, under the auspices of the}
{21053}{}{President. They are to report to the Navarro base in}
{21054}{}{California and, from there, transfer to God only knows}
{21055}{}{where. The soldiers will be re-assigned to various}
{21056}{}{other stations. As for me and a few of my people, we'll}
{21057}{}{be reinforcing the base garrison at Mariposa. I'm}
{21058}{}{curious as to what awaits us there.}
