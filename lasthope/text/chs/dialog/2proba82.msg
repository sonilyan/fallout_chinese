{101}{}{Hello there private, I'm doc Fred. What can I do for you?}
{102}{}{What is your job here, are you a doctor of some kind?}
{103}{}{The sergeant told me that you need some help.}
{104}{}{Nothing.}
#what are you doing here...
{105}{}{Of course, I'm a military doctor and also a scientist.}
{106}{}{So what kind of scientific work are you conducting here.}
{107}{}{Thanks for you time. See you later, doc.}
#
{108}{}{Well, I work on a wide range of scientific fields but only two of them showed any real progress so far:
 weapons development and genetic engineering. Lets say a lack of funding and resources caught up with the rest of my
 projects...}
{109}{}{Good for you, let me ask you something else doc.}
#sergeant told me...
{110}{}{[Smiles.] Indeed... I almost forgot, sarge finally took my advice to assign some more manpower to this
 project. Alright, enough talk. I need you to watch over my "office", I'm going to take care of some business. Please,
 just don't touch anything, this equipment is already very sensitive even without anyone fiddling with it. I'll be back
 shortly, just keep your eyes on my experiments in the meantime.}
{111}{}{OK, doc. I'm gonna take good care of them.}
#doc is back...
{112}{}{[Looking around.] Good, everything seems to be in order. Thank you private, you can go back to your post now.}
{113}{}{Sure thing, doc.}
#dude stole gun...
{114}{}{Hey, didn't I ask you to watch over my work!? [Looks worried.] Where's my prototype weapon that was lying
 on this table...? I don't believe it. If you can't even stand guard, then what are you doing in uniform? Get away from my
 lab before you break something! I'll have to tell the sarge about this, and you private, your ass is going to peel potatoes
 for all eternity!}
{115}{}{Yeah, whatever.}
{116}{}{What if I put a gun in your mouth... Will that shut you up!?}
#
{117}{}{Let me see that...}
{118}{}{Maybe something...}
{119}{}{I don't know...}
{120}{}{...Hm....hm...}
#
{121}{}{No...no...no...}
{122}{}{This is not good.}
#
{123}{}{I'm busy now.}
{124}{}{Watch my stuff!}
#
{125}{}{Get away from my place!}
{126}{}{I'm gonna tell the sarge about this!}
{127}{}{You'll regret this!}
{128}{}{Bad private! You're a shame to your kind.}
#
{129}{}{Thank you!}
{130}{}{Excellent job private, the sarge will know about that.}
{131}{}{Carry on private, good job.}
#
{132}{}{So, what can I help you with, private?}
