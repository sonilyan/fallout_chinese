{5151}{}{好 啊。}
#{5200}{}{I suppose it was to be expected. There was no doubt that even they could sooner or later find out what happened to their hunters.

Would you be interested in helping? We will need as many people as possible to minimize donor casualties.}

#{9000}{}{You have a floater? The fact that the Master and his scientists were able to create something like that shows their amazing skill, doesn't it?

#{9001}{}{Ugh.}

#{9161}{}{I'll be on my way, bye.}
{9161}{}{我马上就来，再见。}
#{9200}{}{As I'm sure you know, commander Herman decides what happens in the city. And since he's a reasonable man, he won't interfere in our business as long as we neither treat nor make use of mutants.

Your people are quite diligent in preventing mutants from entering Albuquerque.}
{9200}{}{我相信你知道，赫尔曼指挥官决定城市里发生什么。既然他是个通情达理的人，只要我们既不对待也不利用变种人，他就不会干涉我们的生意。我可以向你保证，一旦我们发现了一个变种人，我们会马上把他的尸体送到你的基地。当然，这种情况很少发生。你们的人很努力阻止变种人进入阿尔伯克基。}

{9204}{}{我想试着做点什么是没有意义的。}
#{9250}{}{I was hoping you were a reasonable man. But if that's how you see things, I have no choice but to exclude you from our plan.

Here is 500 caps, I never owe anyone anything, and now leave.}

#{9352}{}{It was worth a try.}
{9352}{}{值得一试。}
#{9400}{}{I feel compelled to note that a large number of Hunters were treated here, thus, few would be willing to believe such a tale. The only thing you would accomplish by trying to kill me would be passing on your organs to one of your wiser compatriots, everything with commander Herman's permission.}
{9400}{}{我不得不注意到，这里接待了大量的猎人，因此，很少有人愿意相信这样的故事。如果你想杀了我，你唯一能做的就是把你的器官传给一个聪明的同胞，一切都要经过赫尔曼指挥官的许可。}

#{10152}{}{Really? Could you tell me more? Do you have even an idea who could've done something like that?}
{10152}{}{真正地？你能告诉我更多吗？你知道谁会做那样的事吗？}
#{10153}{}{I've not intention to talk about it. I'm sorry. Goodbye.}
{10153}{}{我不想谈这个。我很抱歉。再见。}
#{10200}{}{You're asking me? I doubt anyone could've performed surgery this complex on you without your knowing. I don't know anyone with access to technology that would be advanced enough to perform the transplants. I'd certainly like to meet such people. We're talking about a fully equipped medical facility and a team of surgeons trained specifically for this task. Not even the empire has the capacity for that. Or were they experimenting on you? If I were to dissect your body, I'm sure I could find out the reason for it all.}
{10200}{}{你在问我？我怀疑有人能在你不知情的情况下给你做这么复杂的手术。我不知道有谁能获得足够先进的技术来进行移植。我当然想见这样的人。我们说的是一个装备齐全的医疗机构和一个专门为这项任务训练的外科医生团队。即使是帝国也没有这个能力。或者他们在你身上做实验？如果我解剖你的身体，我肯定能找出原因。}
#{10201}{}{You're not dissecting me, forget about it. Anyway, thanks for the information. Later.}
{10201}{}{你不是在解剖我，算了吧。不管怎样，谢谢你的消息。以后再说。}
