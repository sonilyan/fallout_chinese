{100}{}{[Surprised.] What the...? Hey, don't sneak up on me like that! Who are you!?}
{101}{}{Uh... Sorry, I was looking for somebody, can you help me out?}
{102}{}{I'm new here, can you tell me something about this place?}
{103}{}{I'm not important but the information that I have could be valuable to the right person...}
#looking for...
{104}{}{Well, I don't know, got some money...? Say $1000?}
{105}{}{Sure, here you go. Now, do you know a guy named Paul?}
{106}{}{No way, I work for mayor Donson. So you better give me some answers right now!}
{107}{}{Sorry, I don't have that money right now.}
#new here...
{108}{}{I... don't exactly live here, so I can't help you with that.}
{109}{}{Nevermind then. [Leave.]}
#have to say...
{110}{}{And who might that person be?}
{111}{}{Well, his name is Paul and I must speak to him as soon as possible.}
{112}{}{I can't remember his name, I have to get going.}
#some answers...
{113}{}{Easy man... you found me. But how did you know about my hiding place, didn't tell anyone... You know it's
 not safe, I don't know what the hell is going on. Donson wants to kill me too because he thought I helped those bastards
 who are now after me. But let me tell you, I did nothing wrong...}
{114}{}{So what have you done?}
#
{115}{}{Two weeks ago a guy came to me and offered money for some information. He wanted to know who died
 recently... their names. I didn't know they were going to dig up and take the bodies... [Sighs]... It's terrible, and I needed
 that money...}
{116}{}{Alright, calm down... I'm here to help. Why do these people want to kill you?}
#
{117}{}{Maybe somebody saw us talking and reported to Donson... As usual, he likes to sniff around... So these guys
 became paranoid and decided to get rid of the evidence... Well, you know the rest of the story.}
{118}{}{Where can I find them?}
#
{119}{}{I know they planned to do something soon. I bet they are going to show up tonight on the cemetery, around
 midnight...}
{120}{}{OK, you stay here now. I'll come back after I've cleared things up.}
#
{121}{}{I'll be here, somewhere... Be careful!}
{122}{}{Haha, you did it! I'm getting off this awful dump, someplace far away where Donson's hounds can't reach me.
 Thanks again!}
#after line 105...
{123}{}{Sure, I know Paul. He's just over there in Red's Bar, ask anyone.}
{124}{}{Alright, thanks.}
#
{125}{}{I'm not going anywhere until this mess clears up.}
{126}{}{I'll be just here, OK?}
