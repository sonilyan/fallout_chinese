#{203}{}{Police told me about your daughter's disappearance. I volunteered to help in the search.}

#{204}{}{Wrong door, sorry.}

#{205}{}{Yes, all data is stored here, though it's mostly reports from City Hall departments. I'm a senior employee of the unit... However, our archive is for internal use only.}
{205}{}{是的，所有的数据都存储在这里，尽管大部分是市政厅部门的报告。我是单位的高级职员。。。但是，我们的档案仅供内部使用。}

#{211}{}{Great!}
{211}{}{太好了！}
#{212}{}{...However, our archive is for internal use only. But I don't think that something will happen to the municipality if someone would obtain some coordinates...}
{212}{}{…但是，我们的档案仅供内部使用。但我不认为如果有人能得到一些坐标，市政当局会出什么事。。。}
#{213}{}{There won17t be any consequences, don't worry.}
{213}{}{不会有任何后果的，别担心。}
#{214}{}{Yes, good to hear. But I need a little time... So, Area 51... A military base... ... ...Yeah. [he moves to the archive room]}
{214}{}{是的，很高兴听到。但我需要一点时间。。。所以，51区。。。军事基地。。。是 啊。[他搬到档案室]}
#{215}{}{[Wait]}
{215}{}{[等等]}
#{216}{}{Yes! Found it! In one of the pre-war reports... Here. And here are the geographic coordinates. Is that a Pip-Boy? Is it working? Then you can simply type in the coordinates and you17ll be able to see the location on the map.}
{216}{}{对！找到了！在一份战前报告中。。。在这里。这是地理坐标。那是个皮普男孩吗？有效吗？然后你只需输入坐标，就能看到地图上的位置。}

#{221}{}{You're not a stupid man and should understand that for helping me I will help you back.}

#{222}{}{Then we could make a deal. What the municipality requires in exchange for this information?}

#{223}{}{Okay, enough! I need the coordinates before I get really mad! Fast!}
{223}{}{好了，够了！在我生气之前我需要坐标！快点！}
#{224}{}{Well, that17s a shame.}

#{225}{}{Err... Young man, don17t try to threaten me... Uh... The security is right behind the door, so...}
{225}{}{呃。。。年轻人，别想威胁我。。。休斯敦大学。。。保安就在门后，所以。。。}
#{226}{}{Listen, shithead, I had enough of your bullshit! I17m not fucking around here! Give me the coordinates!}
{226}{}{听着，混蛋，我受够你的胡说八道了！我可没在这胡闹！把坐标给我！}
#{227}{}{Maybe the municipality has some procedure to get the information from the archive? Can I fill the application form?}
{227}{}{也许市政府有一些程序从档案中获取信息？我能填一下申请表吗？}
#{228}{}{Okay, okay, I'll leave you alone.}
{228}{}{好吧，好吧，我不打扰你了。}
#{229}{}{[The man fixes his glasses on his nose, his eyes are avoiding yours] Er... I repeat... Threats are useless. You won17t get anything. The archive is *only* for mayor's office employees...}
{229}{}{[那人把眼镜戴在鼻子上，眼睛避开你的]呃。。。我再说一遍。。。威胁是无用的。你什么也得不到。档案馆只为市长办公室的员工准备。。。}
#{230}{}{Then maybe I can persuade someone to take the information for me?}
{230}{}{那也许我能说服别人帮我把资料拿走？}
#{231}{}{Well... I don17t think, that... For you... But if you know someone already, then...}
{231}{}{好。。。我不认为。。。为你。。。但是如果你已经认识某人了，那么。。。}
#{232}{}{Fine, I17ll leave you alone for now.}
{232}{}{好吧，我暂时不打扰你。}
#{233}{}{Okay, that17s it, you four-eyed! I17m sick of you! For the last time - give me the coordinates! Or your old ass will be squashed on the spot and no security will save you!}
{233}{}{好了，就这样，你这四只眼睛！我讨厌你！最后一次-给我坐标！否则你的老屁股会被当场压扁，没有保安会救你！}
#{234}{}{[Turns pale. Suddenly starts shouting] Guards!!! Guards!!! Intruder!!!}
{234}{}{[脸色苍白。突然开始大叫]守卫！！！警卫！！！入侵者！！！}
#{235}{}{You son of a bitch! You think that they are faster than my bullet!?}
{235}{}{你这狗娘养的！你认为他们比我的子弹还快！？}
#{236}{}{Er... Honestly, I don17t know... Until now, only City Hall employees had any interest for the archive, and all other citizens didn't care...}
{236}{}{呃。。。老实说，我不知道。。。直到现在，只有市政厅的员工对这个档案有兴趣，其他所有的市民都不在乎。。。}
#{237}{}{Hmm. How much are you being paid for this work?}
{237}{}{嗯。这项工作给你多少钱？}
#{238}{}{Err17 I17m afraid, I can17t tell that either. Not much, really...}
{238}{}{呃，恐怕我也说不出来。不多，真的。。。}
#{239}{}{Then I17ll pay 100 bucks for your trouble.}

#{240}{}{Then I17ll pay 200 bucks for your trouble.}
{240}{}{那我就付200美元给你添麻烦。}
#{241}{}{Then I17ll pay 300 bucks for your trouble.}

#{242}{}{Then I17ll pay 500 bucks for your trouble.}
{242}{}{那我就付500美元给你添麻烦。}
#{243}{}{Forget it then. Bye.}
{243}{}{那就算了吧。再见。}
#{244}{}{You know, I think this is fair. I do need to look after myself after this dusty work... I will get you the coordinates for this price.}
{244}{}{你知道，我觉得这很公平。在这尘土飞扬的工作之后，我确实需要照顾自己。。。我会给你这个价格的坐标。}
#{245}{}{Here is the money.}
{245}{}{这是钱。}
#{246}{}{Only I have no money on me right now. But you can look for coordinates, while I fetch them.}
{246}{}{只是我现在身上没带钱。但你可以找坐标，我去拿。}
#{247}{}{Uh... You know, I value my job more than an opportunity to get bribed once. I really don17t want to lose it.}
{247}{}{休斯敦大学。。。你知道，我看重我的工作胜过一次受贿的机会。我真的不想失去它。}
#{248}{}{Well I, of course, will, but only when you bring the, uh, compensation. For my trouble.}
{248}{}{当然，我会的，但只有当你拿到赔偿金的时候。为了我的麻烦。}
#{249}{}{Shit, then wait I17ll be back soon.}
{249}{}{妈的，等等，我马上回来。}
#{250}{}{Grrm, oh look, here is the money in another pocket. Now, do me a favor and find the coordinates!}
{250}{}{哦，看，这是另一个口袋里的钱。现在，帮我找一下坐标！}
#{251}{}{[The archivist, mumbling something, walks away to the room with archives. He returns half an hour later, with a piece of paper in his hand] That's the coordinates. I see you have a Pip-Boy. Then you could type the coordinates there and see the location on the map.}
{251}{}{[档案管理员咕哝着什么，带着档案走到房间里。他半小时后回来，手里拿着一张纸]这就是坐标。我看你有个小男孩。然后你可以在那里输入坐标并在地图上看到位置。}
#{252}{}{Great! Thanks.}
{252}{}{太好了！谢谢。}
#{253}{}{What are you doing, trying to profit off my problems?!}
{253}{}{你在干什么，想从我的问题中获利？！}
#{254}{}{So you do have problems?! Great, then, we could make a deal.}
{254}{}{你真的有问题吗？！太好了，我们可以做笔交易。}
#{255}{}{Er, no. See you.}
{255}{}{呃，不。再见。}
#{256}{}{Ugh, I have a big problem, something police cannot solve. My daughter disappeared.}
{256}{}{呃，我有个大问题，警察解决不了的。我女儿失踪了。}
#{257}{}{Under what circumstances?}
{257}{}{在什么情况下？}
#{258}{}{My daughter Anna... She's missing. Before we had a long and unpleasant conversation about some new friends, whom she consorted with. I tried to convince her not to get outside the walls of the Clean City. It17s not safe. Seems like she didn17t listen.}
{258}{}{我女儿安娜。。。她失踪了。之前，我们就她结交的一些新朋友进行了一次冗长而不愉快的谈话。我试图说服她不要走出清洁城市的围墙。这不安全。好像她不听。}
#{259}{}{Is it really safer here?}
{259}{}{这里真的安全吗？}
#{260}{}{What friends?}
{260}{}{什么朋友？}
#{261}{}{Of course. But those dirty hippies, riding the wasteland on their bikes - they always fool young and silly girls like Anna.}
{261}{}{当然。但是那些肮脏的嬉皮士，骑着自行车在荒地上-他们总是愚弄像安娜这样的年轻愚蠢的女孩。}
#{262}{}{It looks like we're talking about bikers...}
{262}{}{看起来我们在谈论摩托车手。。。}
#{263}{}{I don17t know much about them, and I don17t want to. She loves these guys. It's, of course, not surprising - she's only fifteen. I usually looked for her in "Hard-Rock", but no one seen her there lately... Maybe they are hiding her from me? I don17t think she could decide to run away from the city at her age.}
{263}{}{我对他们了解不多，我也不想。她喜欢这些家伙。当然，这并不奇怪――她才15岁。我通常在“硬石”里找她，但最近没人在那里看到她。。。也许他们在瞒着我？我认为她这个年纪还不能决定离开这个城市。}
#{264}{}{You17re, of course, somewhat cowardly, but I17ll help you find her. Perhaps, I should start from that cafe...}
{264}{}{你当然有点胆小，但我会帮你找到她的。也许，我应该从那家咖啡馆开始。。。}
#{265}{}{It's too difficult, I'm not sure I can help.}
{265}{}{太难了，我不确定能不能帮上忙。}
#{266}{}{It17s you! I17m so happy to see you! You know, she really came back! But she looks awful. I told her not to mess with those bikers, but she didn17t listen! Now she will listen to her father more. I17m so thankful to you... Ahem. You know, I was thinking, such things cannot go without reward. Here is 2000 bucks - I hope, it is enough, to at least cover your expenses on the travel.}
{266}{}{是你！很高兴见到你！你知道，她真的回来了！但她看起来糟透了。我告诉她不要和那些摩托车手乱搞，但她不听！现在她要多听她父亲的话。我太感谢你了。。。啊哼。你知道，我在想，这样的事情不能没有回报。这是2000美元-我希望，这足够了，至少可以支付你的旅行费用。}
#{267}{}{Not bad for such an easy job! Take care.}
{267}{}{这么简单的工作还不错！当心。}
#{268}{}{That's good, but I am looking for Area 51. This is a military base, 80 miles from Vegas. Could you search the files for its coordinates?}
{268}{}{很好，但我在找51区。这是一个军事基地，离维加斯80英里。你能在文件里查一下它的坐标吗？}
#{269}{}{Oh, of course! I've been notified. Mr. Williamson asked for you himself! Well, let17s see... What do you need to find again?}
{269}{}{哦，当然！我接到通知了。威廉森先生亲自找你的！好吧，让我们看看。。。你还需要找到什么？}
#{270}{}{Coordinates of Area 51...}
{270}{}{51区的坐标。。。}

{277}{}{谢谢。}
#{278}{}{Mr. Clark, this pendant is your daughter's, right?}
{278}{}{克拉克先生，这个吊坠是你女儿的，对吗？}
#{279}{}{[His hands are shaking] Oh, my God... It's her pendant, but... Where!? Where did you get it!? Answer me!!!}
{279}{}{[他的手在颤抖]哦，天哪。。。是她的吊坠，但是。。。哪里！？你从哪儿弄来的！？回答我！！！}
#{280}{}{That's all that's left of her. She died.}
{280}{}{她只剩下这些了。她死了。}
#{281}{}{She gave it to me, saying that she'll never come back to you.}
{281}{}{她把它给了我，说她再也不会回到你身边了。}
#{282}{}{It was on one of the bikers. These bastards didn't tell me what they did to her.}
{282}{}{是在一个骑自行车的人身上。这些混蛋没告诉我他们对她做了什么。}
#{283}{}{No! Nooo! [He takes the pendant to the heart and begins to cry painfully]}
{283}{}{不！不！[他把吊坠放在心上，痛苦地哭了起来]}
#{284}{}{Yeah, cry, you pussy.}
{284}{}{是啊，哭吧，你个娘娘腔。}
#{285}{}{I'm so sorry.}
{285}{}{我很抱歉。}
#{286}{}{Oh no... [pops his eyes frantically and sits down to keep himself from falling to the ground] No... This is all my fault! I should have paid more attention to my beloved daughter! And now... Now it's too late... [He covers his face with hands and begins to cry]}
{286}{}{哦不。。。[疯狂地瞪大眼睛，坐下来不让自己摔倒在地]不。。。这都是我的错！我应该多关心我心爱的女儿！现在。。。现在太晚了。。。[他用手捂住脸开始哭]}
#{287}{}{Oh no... [pops his eyes frantically and sits down to keep himself from falling to the ground] No... They did it. They killed her!.. Oh God... This is all my fault! I should have paid more attention to my beloved daughter! And now... Now it's too late... [He covers his face his hands and begins to cry]}
{287}{}{哦不。。。[疯狂地瞪大眼睛，坐下来不让自己摔倒在地]不。。。他们做到了。他们杀了她！。。哦上帝。。。这都是我的错！我应该多关心我心爱的女儿！现在。。。现在太晚了。。。[他捂着脸和手开始哭]}
#{288}{}{::cries::}
{288}{}{●哭声：}
#{289}{}{Today he won't talk to you.}
{289}{}{今天他不跟你说话。}
#{1201}{}{Where am I? Is this an archive?}

#{1204}{}{Wrong door.}
