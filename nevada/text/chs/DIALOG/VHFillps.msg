#{100}{}{You see Sam Phillips.}
{100}{}{你看到山姆・菲利普斯了。}
#{101}{}{You see Sam Phillips, the owner of "Hard Rock" cafe.}
{101}{}{你看到山姆・菲利普斯，“硬石”咖啡馆的老板。}
#{110}{}{[Sighs] what is it about, young man?}
{110}{}{这是怎么回事，年轻人？}
#{111}{}{I got here by accident, and certainly not for ceremonious talk. I'm out of here.}
{111}{}{我来这里是偶然的，当然不是为了隆重的谈话。我要走了。}
#{112}{}{Sorry to bother you.}
{112}{}{很抱歉打扰你。}
#{113}{}{I see you have an empty stage. Why?}
{113}{}{我看到你的舞台空荡荡的。为什么？}
#{114}{}{It's quite difficult to find a good artist. You know - now is not the time for entertainment.}
{114}{}{很难找到一个好的艺术家。你知道-现在不是娱乐的时候。}
#{115}{}{I know a great jazzman from Reno...}
{115}{}{我认识一个来自里诺的爵士乐手...}
#{116}{}{Have you tried to do the casting?}
{116}{}{你试过选角吗？}
#{117}{}{How many people have you auditioned over the years?}
{117}{}{这些年来你试镜过多少人？}
#{118}{}{Yes, I understand. Well, good luck to you.}
{118}{}{是的，我明白。祝你好运。}
#{119}{}{Yes, no performer will stay in your shithole! Me included.}
{119}{}{是的，没有表演者会留在你的狗屎坑里！包括我在内。}
#{120}{}{We tried it a few years ago. We found some good guys then, but the fame crippled all of them... If you know what I mean.}
{120}{}{我们几年前就试过了。我们找到了一些好人，但是名声毁了他们...如果你明白我的意思。}
#{121}{}{Three people each year. We don??t get more than that. They mainly perform gangster songs and blues, that are the most simple and accessible for performers.}
{121}{}{每年三个人。我们没有得到更多。他们主要表演黑帮歌曲和蓝调，这是最简单，最容易获得的表演者。}
#{122}{}{Jazzman? Are you serious?! Hmm... You know, I am little scared that he's from Reno. How good is he?}
{122}{}{爵士乐手？你是认真的吗？！Hmm...你知道，我有点害怕他来自雷诺。他有多好？}
#{123}{}{Honestly, I somehow missed his tour.}
{123}{}{老实说，我不知怎么错过了他的巡演。}
#{124}{}{I'm sure - he is the one you need!}
{124}{}{我肯定-他就是你需要的人！}
#{125}{}{What's the difference? Just audition him and decide for yourself.}
{125}{}{有什么区别？试镜他然后自己决定。}
#{126}{}{Actually, I don??t know, I'm sorry to bother you.}
{126}{}{事实上，我不知道，很抱歉打扰你。}
#{127}{}{Is that so? Listen, I do not want to waste my time on people useless for me and my place. Bye.}
{127}{}{是这样吗？听着，我不想把时间浪费在那些对我和我的地盘毫无用处的人身上。再见。}
#{128}{}{Damn. Well, maybe you can change your mind...}
{128}{}{该死。嗯，也许你可以改变主意...}
#{129}{}{Hmm... We can try... Just from our respect to you.}
{129}{}{Hmm...我们可以试试...只是出于我们对你的尊敬。}
#{130}{}{Great!}
{130}{}{太好了！}
#{131}{}{It??s important to me - I can only rely on those who can be trusted. All workers in this cafe are employed only by someone's recommendation. I don??t want idiots on stage and hassle coming with them. Take care.}
{131}{}{这对我很重要-我只能依靠那些可以信任的人。这家咖啡馆的所有员工都是由别人推荐的。我不想白痴上台和他们一起闹事。当心。}
#{132}{}{Well, we can listen to your friend... Since it's *you* who recommends him.}
{132}{}{好吧，我们可以听听你的朋友...因为是你推荐他。}
#{133}{}{How cute. But, you see, I can only rely on those who can be trusted. All workers in this cafe are employed only by someone's recommendation. I don??t want idiots on stage and hassle coming with them. So all the best to you and your acquaintance.}
{133}{}{多可爱啊。但是，你看，我只能依靠那些可以信任的人。这家咖啡馆的所有员工都是由别人推荐的。我不想白痴上台和他们一起闹事。祝你和你的熟人一切顺利。}
#{134}{}{Well, okay. Bring him to the cafe and we'll have a look. I trust you, don??t disappoint me.}
{134}{}{好吧，好吧。把他带到咖啡馆，我们去看看。我相信你，别让我失望。}
#{135}{}{Sure! I??ll go tell him this great news.}
{135}{}{当然！我去告诉他这个好消息。}
#{136}{}{Cafe owner is ready to audition Big Louie. All left is to tell the news to musician now.}
{136}{}{咖啡馆老板准备试镜大路易。现在只剩下把这个消息告诉音乐家了。}
#{150}{}{You look upset. What happened?}
{150}{}{你看起来很沮丧。怎么搞的？}
#{151}{}{[Waves his hand] Sorry, I have a lot of bad things happening to me right now, but it doesn??t concern you, I just can??t concentrate on my work... What did you want?}
{151}{}{[挥挥手]对不起，我现在有很多不好的事情发生在我身上，但这与你无关，我只是不能专心工作...你想要什么？}
#{152}{}{Let's go back.}
{152}{}{我们回去吧。}
#{153}{}{In fact, nothing.}
{153}{}{事实上，没什么。}
#{154}{}{And yet - perhaps you need help?}
{154}{}{但是-也许你需要帮助？}
#{155}{}{You know, certainly not from you. My situation is too uncertain and dangerous, I'm afraid, you will only make matters worse.}
{155}{}{你知道，当然不是你。我的处境太不确定，太危险了，恐怕你只会使事情更糟。}
#{156}{}{Well whatever you say.}
{156}{}{不管你说什么。}
#{157}{}{I have no choice in my position. My friends afraid to interfere, and you're a new man, you may be able to find out, who did it... If you, of course, believe me. And if not - then join the camp of my enemies, there is plenty of space for you.}
{157}{}{我在我的位置上别无选择。我的朋友不敢干涉，而你又是新来的人，你也许能查出来，是谁干的...当然，如果你相信我。如果没有-那就加入我敌人的阵营吧，那里有足够的空间给你。}
#{158}{}{I see, that you??re a good man without dirt in his heart. That??s why I will help you anyway.}
{158}{}{我明白了，你是个好人，心里没有污垢。这就是为什么我无论如何都会帮助你。}
#{159}{}{I'll pass then.}
{159}{}{那我就过去。}
#{160}{}{[Sighs] Thank you, but I wasn??t always such a good person, I have a lot of history with drugs behind me. And the past, like a nightmare, showed itself again.}
{160}{}{谢谢你，但我并不总是这么好的人，我有很多吸毒的历史。而过去，就像一场噩梦，再次显现。}
#{161}{}{What happened?}
{161}{}{怎么搞的？}
#{162}{}{I was framed. Someone told the police that I buy poison from which my clients die. Cops turned the cafe upside-down, found all kind of additives and left - supposedly, for tests. But who will test them, really? These idiots won??t tell sodium from marijuana! They don??t realize that it??s just a salt.}
{162}{}{我被陷害了。有人告诉警察，我买了毒药，我的客户会因此而死。警察把咖啡馆翻了个底朝天，找到了各种各样的添加剂，然后离开了――应该是为了测试。但谁来测试他们呢？这些白痴根本分不清钠和大麻！他们没有意识到这只是一种盐。}
#{163}{}{Why are they so sure?}
{163}{}{为什么他们这么肯定？}
#{164}{}{I don??t know. They have false evidence and it seems no one cares to figure it out. The last days I live under the fear of prison or the death penalty.}
{164}{}{我不知道。他们有伪证，似乎没人想弄清楚。最后的日子我生活在对监狱或死刑的恐惧中。}
#{165}{}{And you really bought a batch of dope?}
{165}{}{你真的买了一批毒品？}
#{166}{}{No! I work only with a few caravans, most of them are working for "Monte". But, basically, Bob brings all needed goods.}
{166}{}{不！我只和几个大篷车一起工作，他们大多数都是为“蒙特”工作的。但是，基本上，鲍勃带来了所有需要的货物。}
#{167}{}{Where can I find him?}
{167}{}{我在哪能找到他？}
#{168}{}{Bob? He always hangs around the caravan parking lot.}
{168}{}{鲍勃？他总是在大篷车停车场闲逛。}
#{169}{}{Who could have set you up?}
{169}{}{谁能陷害你？}
#{170}{}{I don??t know. I think, just any competitor. After all, there are not so many people that have been able to rebuild the old venues and get them to profit the city. I can??t say anything more.}
{170}{}{我不知道。我想，任何竞争者都可以。毕竟，没有那么多人能够重建旧场馆，让它们为城市牟利。我不能再说什么了。}
#{171}{}{All of this is very vague. Well, let's see what we can do.}
{171}{}{所有这些都很模糊。好吧，让我们看看我们能做些什么。}
#{172}{}{About your problem with the police - it??s all settled. Well, at least you have been proved innocent, but who did this is still a mystery to me.}
{172}{}{关于你和警察的问题-一切都解决了。好吧，至少你被证明是无辜的，但谁干的这件事对我来说还是个谜。}
#{173}{}{It wasn??t so simple, was it? I know already, by the way. The police contacted me and told me everything, with apologies. You saved me! I lost all hope and was ready to go to prison. You know, I think you earned this. Here, take it. [gives 1000 bucks]}
{173}{}{不是那么简单吧？顺便说一下，我已经知道了。警察联系了我，告诉了我一切，并表示歉意。你救了我！我失去了一切希望，准备坐牢。我想这是你应得的。来，拿着。[给1000美元]}
#{174}{}{Oh! It was worth it!}
{174}{}{哦！这是值得的！}
#{175}{}{Regarding your enemies. It turns out that "evidence" was planted by one of the competitors - the owner of the "Monte" casino.}
{175}{}{关于你的敌人。原来，“证据”是其中一个竞争对手栽赃的――“蒙特”赌场的老板。}
#{176}{}{My God! I did not think Hal is so greedy... Well, I will not grieve if he gets his due. I did not get into his business and will not do so in the future, especially for the purpose of revenge. Thanks for telling.}
{176}{}{天哪！我没想到哈尔这么贪婪...好吧，如果他得到应得的，我不会难过的。我没有进入他的生意，将来也不会这样做，尤其是为了报复。谢谢你告诉我。}
#{177}{}{You??re welcome.}
{177}{}{不客气。}
#{178}{}{What can you tell me about this substance? Caravan admitted that he delivers you to the party this rubbish...}
{178}{}{关于这种物质你能告诉我什么？大篷车承认他送你去派对这垃圾...}
#{179}{}{Oh, you too... Police didn??t understand either. This is for pizza. In our time it is not so easy to find a handful of grain to make normal dough, so we make it from all sorts of things - from cardboard, for example. And so the dough was so tough that we had to add emulsifier E30. This particular substance is being extracted from the depths of the Salt Lake and somehow it enriches the taste... A harmless thing, but it is better not to try separately, otherwise you will be obliged with the night in the toilet.}
{179}{}{哦，你也是...警察也不明白。这是给比萨饼的。在我们这个时代，要找到一把谷物来做普通的面团并不容易，所以我们用各种各样的东西来做面团――比如用纸板。所以面团太硬了，我们不得不加入乳化剂E30。这种特殊的物质是从盐湖深处提取出来的，不知何故它丰富了味道...一件无害的事情，但最好不要单独尝试，否则你将不得不在厕所过夜。}
#{180}{}{Hmm...}
{180}{}{Hmm...}
#{200}{}{I'm the official courier of the Nuka-Cola factory in Salt Lake. Would you be interested in buying from us?}
{200}{}{我是盐湖城努卡可乐厂的官方信使。您有兴趣向我们购买吗？}
#{201}{}{I'd love to, but I cannot. We have big problems in the cafe. It is possible that we enter into this transaction and there will be no one to deal with soon. Let's not take chances now.}
{201}{}{我很想去，但我不能。我们在咖啡馆有大麻烦。我们有可能达成这笔交易，但很快就没有人处理了。我们现在不要冒险。}
#{202}{}{May I know, what is the problem?}
{202}{}{我可以知道，有什么问题吗？}
#{203}{}{Wow, sorry, sure no need for that.}
{203}{}{哇，对不起，当然没必要。}
#{204}{}{Hmm... Perhaps. My problems have been solved, so we may take the risk. But can I see your papers?}
{204}{}{Hmm...也许。我的问题已经解决了，所以我们可以冒险。但我能看看你的文件吗？}
#{205}{}{Sure. Here is the license.}
{205}{}{当然。这是许可证。}
#{206}{}{I don??t have them on me. I??ll bring them later.}
{206}{}{我身上没有。我待会再拿来。}
#{207}{}{Er... No. Don??t ask, why. I have my reasons... A few of them. But still don??t ask!}
{207}{}{呃...不。别问，为什么。我有我的理由...其中一些。但还是不要问！}
#{208}{}{I hope, you will change your mind.}
{208}{}{我希望你能改变主意。}
#{209}{}{I can??t take a risk, especially after all this problems I went through. It??s not about you, please understand, I??m just in time of uncertainty. I need to be completely sure in you merchandise. So bring your license, then we can make a deal.}
{209}{}{我不能冒险，尤其是在经历了这么多问题之后。这与你无关，请理解，我只是在不确定的时候。我需要对你的商品有充分的把握。带上你的驾照，我们就可以做笔交易了。}
#{210}{}{Fine.}
{210}{}{好的。}
#{211}{}{[Carefully studies the papers] Very good. [nods] Very. This is what I needed - confidence in my partner. We will cooperate with you.}
{211}{}{[仔细研究论文]很好。[点头]非常。这就是我所需要的――对我的搭档充满信心。我们将与您合作。}
#{212}{}{Great!}
{212}{}{太好了！}
#{213}{}{Let's do this - I will order a vending machine set for the sale of the beverage. This will simplify our business. You can monitor the process through the software in the machine. But keep in mind - we're not going to take care of your product before it is in stock. Any issues about the deliveries you figure out on your own.}
{213}{}{让我们这样做吧-我将订购一台自动售货机来销售饮料。这将简化我们的业务。你可以通过机器里的软件来监控这个过程。但请记住，我们不会在你们的产品有货之前就处理它。关于送货的任何问题你都可以自己解决。}
#{214}{}{I'll deal with this... Are you excited about our collaboration?}
{214}{}{我来处理这个...你对我们的合作感到兴奋吗？}
#{215}{}{Excellent. Let??s get strait to sealing the contract.}
{215}{}{杰出的。让我们开始密封合同吧。}
#{216}{}{Very! Finally, we will be able to outdo this arrogants in Clean City.}
{216}{}{非常好！最后，我们将能够在干净的城市里战胜这些傲慢的人。}
#{217}{}{Who?}
{217}{}{谁？}
#{218}{}{If you have not noticed, the "Monte" casino has signed a contract with the same factory that you work with. It is our - and your - competitor. Funny, isn't it?}
{218}{}{如果你没有注意到，“蒙特”赌场已经与你工作的同一家工厂签订了合同。它是我们和你的竞争对手。很有趣，不是吗？}
#{219}{}{Funny that I'm working with my own competitors? Huh...}
{219}{}{有趣的是，我和我自己的竞争对手一起工作？呵呵...}
#{220}{}{As long as the casino functions, you'll have to share with them the market in Vegas... Where was I? Oh yeah! I suggest signing the contract, partner!}
{220}{}{只要赌场正常运作，你就得和他们分享拉斯维加斯的市场...我刚才在哪？哦，是的！我建议签合同，搭档！}
#{221}{}{Sure, partner!}
{221}{}{当然，搭档！}
#{229}{}{Great deal. We'll work well together. Come tomorrow, I think we can set up a vending machine by that time. But first, take care of the availability of goods in stock. Have a nice day.}
{229}{}{太好了。我们会合作得很好的。明天来吧，我想到时候我们可以安装自动售货机了。但首先，要注意存货的供应。祝您有个美好的一天。}
#{230}{}{Sure! Have a nice day, Mr. Phillips!}
{230}{}{当然！祝你今天愉快，菲利普斯先生！}
#{1110}{}{[Sighs] what is it about, ma'am?}
{1110}{}{怎么回事，夫人？}
#{1120}{}{His name is... Er... I don??t know myself, but he's a talent, trust me.}
{1120}{}{他的名字是...呃...我不了解自己，但他是个天才，相信我。}
#{1123}{}{Honestly, I somehow missed his tour.}
{1123}{}{老实说，我不知怎么错过了他的巡演。}
#{1124}{}{I'm sure - he is the one you need!}
{1124}{}{我肯定-他就是你需要的人！}
