### {100}{}{Hello, can I help you with something?}
{100}{}{你好，我能帮你做点什么吗？}
### {101}{}{Who are you?}
{101}{}{你是谁？}
### {102}{}{What is this place?}
{102}{}{这是什么地方？}
### {103}{}{Actually I don't have time for this, goodbye.}
{103}{}{实际上我没有时间，再见。}
### {104}{}{Welcome back stranger, something else you wanted?}
{104}{}{欢迎陌生人回来，你还想要什么？}
### {105}{}{I'm Brian, chief of security here. Have you come for the job?}
{105}{}{我是布莱恩，这里的安全负责人。你是来上班的吗？}
### {106}{}{Nope, what job are you talking about?}
{106}{}{不，你说的是什么工作？}
### {107}{}{Sorry, not interested. Let me ask you something else.}
{107}{}{对不起，不感兴趣。让我再问你一件事。}
### {108}{}{I have put a notice on the bulletin board, that we need someone skilled with guns.}
{108}{}{我在公告栏上贴了一条通知，说我们需要一个精通枪支的人。}
### {109}{}{What for?}
{109}{}{为何}
### {110}{}{There are some serious issues. We got many problems inside the administration. One of them is security. Since all the money we make is spent on repairs and maintenance, there's very little left to pay for guards. People just walk away and don't want to work for us anymore.}
{110}{}{有一些严重的问题。我们在政府内部遇到了很多问题。其中之一就是安全。由于我们赚的钱都花在了维修和保养上，所以几乎没有钱支付警卫的费用了。人们只是走开了，不想再为我们工作了。}
### {111}{}{So, how is that affecting your business here?}
{111}{}{那么，这对你在这里的业务有何影响？}
### {112}{}{There are always bandits, raiders... And they all want the same thing... Since we lost so many people, our defenses are very weak. We can't hold those attacks anymore so we decided to force it while we still have strength.}
{112}{}{总有土匪，掠夺者。。。他们都想要同样的东西。。。由于我们失去了这么多人，我们的防御非常薄弱。我们再也无法控制这些攻击了，所以我们决定趁我们还有力量的时候强行发动。}
### {113}{}{So, what's the plan?}
{113}{}{那么，计划是什么呢？}
### {114}{}{It's very simple. This is our land and they will play by our rules. We're going to tighten our position here, secure all entrances to this power plant. They're itching to attack, which may very well occur sooner than later. I'm not sure when... but I can feel something is going to happen very soon.}
{114}{}{这很简单。这是我们的土地，他们将遵守我们的规则。我们将加强我们在这里的阵地，保护这个发电厂的所有入口。它们渴望攻击，这很可能迟早会发生。我不确定什么时候。。。但我能感觉到事情很快就会发生。}
### {115}{}{What about those people in the city? They are the plant workers, are they safe?}
{115}{}{城里的那些人呢？他们是工厂工人，他们安全吗？}
### {116}{}{I can assure you they are. Bandits were never interested in them because we give them food and clothes, but no money. So practically there's nothing to steal from them. And besides that, all of our workers live and work at the plant which is in the underground facility complex.}
{116}{}{我可以向你保证他们是。土匪从来没有对他们感兴趣，因为我们给他们食物和衣服，但没有钱。所以实际上没有什么可偷的。除此之外，我们所有的工人都在地下设施综合体的工厂生活和工作。}
### {117}{}{I'm not sure I understand you...?}
{117}{}{我不确定我是否理解你。。。？}
### {118}{}{You will have a chance if we succeed. Now, we have a more important matter to discuss. Tell me, what do you think about helping us in exchange for some money and supplies?}
{118}{}{如果我们成功了，你将有机会。现在，我们有一件更重要的事情要讨论。告诉我，你认为帮助我们换取一些钱和物资怎么样？}
### {119}{}{How much money are we talking about?}
{119}{}{我们说的是多少钱？}
### {120}{}{I don't like this at all. I'll be going now.}
{120}{}{我一点也不喜欢这个。我现在就去。}
### {121}{}{Say about $1000.}
{121}{}{比如说1000美元。}
### {122}{}{OK, I'm in.}
{122}{}{好的，我来了。}
### {123}{}{Could you raise that amount? I'm supposed to be shoot at.}
{123}{}{你能提高那个数额吗？我应该受到枪击。}
### {124}{}{Excellent, I'm glad I have you with us. After we finish our operation your money will be waiting here. Once you are ready, report to me.}
{124}{}{太好了，我很高兴有你和我们在一起。我们做完手术后，你的钱会在这里等着。一旦你准备好了，就向我报告。}
### {125}{}{I think I'm ready now.}
{125}{}{我想我现在已经准备好了。}
### {126}{}{I'll be back when I'm ready.}
{126}{}{我准备好了就回来。}
### {127}{}{Risk is part of the job. So... no, I make the rules! Take it or leave it.}
{127}{}{风险是工作的一部分。所以…不，我制定规则！要么接受，要么离开。}
### {128}{}{I'll take it.}
{128}{}{我要它。}
### {129}{}{Forget it, I'm gone.}
{129}{}{算了，我走了。}
### {130}{}{Just say what's on your mind.}
{130}{}{说出你的想法。}
### {131}{}{About that job?}
{131}{}{关于那份工作？}
### {132}{}{Nothing at the moment.}
{132}{}{现在什么都没有。}
### {133}{}{Have you changed your mind?}
{133}{}{你改变主意了吗？}
### {134}{}{This is Duntown's power plant. With our little reactor we are powering several areas around Duntown. We are also exporting uranium ore for similar types of reactors and some other types of generators designed to use this kind of fuel.}
{134}{}{这是敦镇的发电厂。利用我们的小型反应堆，我们正在为邓敦周围的几个地区供电。我们还出口铀矿石，用于类似类型的反应堆和其他一些设计用于使用这种燃料的发电机。}
### {135}{}{How can one procure some uranium?}
{135}{}{如何获取铀？}
### {136}{}{You said you have a nuclear reactor, it must be very small to fit in that room.}
{136}{}{你说你有一个核反应堆，它必须很小才能放在那个房间里。}
### {137}{}{Interesting, let me ask you something else.}
{137}{}{有趣的是，让我问你一些其他的问题。}
### {138}{}{There's a procedure for that. I'm too busy right now to tell you all the details. Talk to Leonard in the administration building. He's in charge of the administrative work, so he could help you. The administration building is just north from here.}
{138}{}{这是有程序的。我现在太忙了，没时间告诉你所有的细节。在行政大楼里和伦纳德谈谈。他负责行政工作，所以他可以帮助你。行政大楼就在这里的北边。}
### {139}{}{Thanks. There's something else I wanted to ask you.}
{139}{}{谢谢我还有件事想问你。}
### {140}{}{I thought you would ask about that. Well, the reactor is actually underground. For safety reasons I can tell you only that.}
{140}{}{我以为你会问这个。反应堆实际上在地下。出于安全考虑，我只能告诉你。}
### {141}{}{That makes sense, thanks for the info.}
{141}{}{这很有道理，谢谢你提供的信息。}
### {142}{}{We must wait now. They could attack any second, so prepare yourself!}
{142}{}{我们现在必须等待。他们随时可能攻击，所以做好准备！}
### {143}{}{I'm ready for this.}
{143}{}{我已经准备好了。}
### {144}{}{We did it! You really got skills and could be very valuable to us. You earned this... There's a locker with your reward. I really could use your presence here, but first you deserve to know things about us. Here's a key which will give you access to the lower levels. There you will find any answers you seek. }
{144}{}{我们做到了！你真的很有技巧，对我们来说很有价值。这是你应得的。。。有一个储物柜，里面有你的奖励。我真的可以利用你在这里的存在，但首先你应该了解我们。这是一把钥匙，可以让你进入较低级别。在那里你会找到你想要的任何答案。}
### {145}{}{Thanks.}
{145}{}{谢谢}
### {146}{}{Keep that key with you all the time. And by the way... if somebody asks, you are a new worker here, OK?}
{146}{}{把那把钥匙一直带在身边。顺便说一下。。。如果有人问，你是这里的新员工，好吗？}
### {147}{}{Sure thing, thanks again.}
{147}{}{当然，再次感谢。}
### {148}{}{Hello again, how are things going with you?}

### {150}{}{Don't touch that!}
{150}{}{别碰那个！}
### {151}{}{What are you doing!?}
{151}{}{你在干什么！？}
### {152}{}{Leave that locker alone!}
{152}{}{别管那个储物柜！}
### {153}{}{Hello there, something you wanted?}
{153}{}{你好，你想要什么？}
### {154}{}{I think I found the cause of your financial problems.}
{154}{}{我想我找到了你财务问题的原因。}
### {155}{}{Nothing at the moment.}
{155}{}{现在什么都没有。}
### {156}{}{So, what have you got?}
{156}{}{那么，你得到了什么？}
### {157}{}{I found this account book with some things you might be interested in, here you go. [You hand him the book.]}
{157}{}{我在这本账簿上找到了一些你可能感兴趣的东西，给你。[你把书递给他。]}
### {158}{}{Let me see... [Reading the book.] Hah, I knew it. I knew there was something wrong with those bills... But, who would do such a thing. Maybe someone with an outside connection...}
{158}{}{让我看看。。。[看书。]哈，我就知道。我就知道那些账单有问题。。。但是，谁会做这样的事呢。也许是一个与外界有联系的人。。。}
### {159}{}{And who might that be?}
{159}{}{那可能是谁？}
### {160}{}{I have no idea. I will need at least one day to analyze this book. It's best if you come back tomorrow. We must expose the person responsible for this as soon as possible, before he causes more trouble.}
{160}{}{我不知道。我至少需要一天的时间来分析这本书。最好你明天再来。我们必须尽快揭露对此负有责任的人，以免他制造更多麻烦。}
### {161}{}{OK, see you tomorrow then.}
{161}{}{好吧，明天见。}
### {162}{}{I'm not finished yet, I need more time.}
{162}{}{我还没有结束，我需要更多的时间。}
### {163}{}{I'll leave you to it.}
{163}{}{我就交给你吧。}
### {164}{}{You're here just on time. I have finished studying those accounts... And everything points to one man... Damn, this is harder than I thought it would be.}
{164}{}{你来得正是时候。我已经研究完了那些账目。。。一切都指向一个人…该死，这比我想象的要难。}
### {165}{}{What's wrong?}
{165}{}{怎么了？}
### {166}{}{The accountant in charge during the time those accounts were written, was Mr. Charles. Unfortunately he died under mysterious circumstances about a year ago. And if you want to know who got his job afterwards, the answer is nobody did.}
{166}{}{在写这些账目的时候，负责会计的是查尔斯先生。不幸的是，他大约一年前在神秘的情况下去世了。如果你想知道谁后来得到了他的工作，答案是没有人得到。}
### {167}{}{Why is that?}
{167}{}{为什么？}
### {168}{}{Because of the financial situation that took place again... However, something else draw my attention. There's a possibility that somebody else was involved because there's a different handwriting on a few pages...}
{168}{}{由于再次发生的财务状况。。。然而，另一件事引起了我的注意。有可能是其他人参与其中，因为几页上有不同的笔迹。。。}
### {169}{}{So, what are you going to do?}
{169}{}{那么，你打算怎么办？}
### {170}{}{It looks like we have to find this person or there could be more of them. Are you with me?}
{170}{}{看起来我们必须找到这个人，否则可能会有更多的人。你和我在一起吗？}
### {171}{}{Yes.}
{171}{}{对}
### {172}{}{Not just yet.}
{172}{}{还没有。}
### {173}{}{Good. The best thing now is that you start your search here. I have my suspicions about one person, Christopher. He's the cleaning guy, but I never managed to find the whole truth about him. It also seems like some people are protecting him, don't really know why... That means you must act as a new guy and find out whatever you can. Our time is short... And keep me informed.}
{173}{}{好的现在最好的事情是你在这里开始搜索。我怀疑有一个人，克里斯托弗。他是个清洁工，但我从来没有找到关于他的全部真相。似乎也有人在保护他，不知道为什么。。。这意味着你必须表现得像个新人，尽你所能去发现。我们的时间很短。。。并随时通知我。}
### {174}{}{Sure thing, Brian.}
{174}{}{当然，布莱恩。}
### {175}{}{You are here, so did you find out anything?}
{175}{}{你在这里，你发现什么了吗？}
### {176}{}{I have spoken to Christopher and it looks like he murdered Charles and took the money that Charles stole from you. And there's also something about him... I don't know how to tell you...}
{176}{}{我已经和克里斯托弗谈过了，看起来他谋杀了查尔斯，拿走了查尔斯从你那里偷来的钱。还有一些关于他的东西。。。我不知道该怎么告诉你。。。}
### {177}{}{Nothing yet.}
{177}{}{还没有。}
### {178}{}{That bastard... And still he is stealing money from me. But selling drugs to my workers... That's a more serious crime. He's going to pay for all of this. And Charles... He was a good man. Did you find any of that money which he had stolen?}
{178}{}{那个混蛋。。。他仍然在偷我的钱。但向我的工人出售毒品。。。这是一个更严重的罪行。他将为此付出代价。查尔斯。。。他是个好人。你发现他偷的钱了吗？}
### {179}{}{Unfortunately, there's a little problem. You see, he's dead. He killed himself before I could find out anything. I'm sorry.}
{179}{}{不幸的是，有一个小问题。你看，他死了。我还没发现什么，他就自杀了。对不起。}
### {180}{}{Well, I feel pity only because I haven't shoot him myself. Nevertheless, the fool is dead, he got what he deserved. Thank you for your services. Here's some money for your trouble. That was some great service, stranger. You are welcome here at any time, and stay as long as you like.}
{180}{}{我觉得很可怜，只是因为我自己没有开枪打他。尽管如此，傻瓜已经死了，他得到了他应得的。感谢您的服务。这是给你的麻烦钱。真是太棒了，陌生人。欢迎你随时来这里，想住多久就住多久。}
### {181}{}{Thanks. I'll be off then.}
{181}{}{谢谢那我就走。}
### {182}{}{Is there some reward for the job?}
{182}{}{这份工作有报酬吗？}
### {183}{}{Of course. I always respect and reward fair work. After the job is done, we'll talk about your reward.}
{183}{}{当然我总是尊重和奖励公平的工作。工作完成后，我们将讨论您的报酬。}
### {184}{}{OK, I'm in.}
{184}{}{好的，我来了。}
### {185}{}{I'll be back when I'm ready.}
{185}{}{我准备好了就回来。}
### {186}{}{You're back, are you going to help me with this?}
{186}{}{你回来了，你会帮我吗？}
### {187}{}{Welcome back stranger, how's it going?}
{187}{}{欢迎陌生人回来，进展如何？}
### {188}{}{OK, I'll be going now.}
{188}{}{好的，我现在就去。}
### {189}{}{Tell me what you know... There's nothing more disastrous than all this mess he brought upon us all.}
{189}{}{告诉我你知道什么。。。没有什么比他给我们大家带来的混乱更灾难性的了。}
### {190}{}{You're right about that... He sold drugs to the workers, so many of them became addicted that he was actually making a lot of money...}
{190}{}{你说得对。。。他把毒品卖给工人，他们中的许多人都上瘾了，他实际上赚了很多钱。。。}
### {191}{}{As chief of security, haven't you noticed anything unusual, like a major radiation leak on the third level?}
{191}{}{作为安全负责人，你没有注意到任何异常情况吗，比如第三层的重大辐射泄漏？}
### {192}{}{I don't know anything about a leak. That level was deemed off limits a long time ago. Besides, my focus is up here where the real danger is. Still, the safety of the people working here IS my concern, as such it would help if you'd stay away from that level, it would make my job a lot easier.}
{192}{}{我对泄漏一无所知。这个水平在很久以前就被认为是禁止的。此外，我的重点是真正危险的地方。尽管如此，在这里工作的人的安全是我关心的，因此，如果你远离那个级别，这会有所帮助，这会让我的工作轻松很多。}
### {193}{}{Is there anything you can do about it?}
{193}{}{你能做些什么吗？}
### {194}{}{Who would be in charge of this matter?}
{194}{}{谁来负责这件事？}
### {195}{}{Why don't you send someone to fix the problem?}
{195}{}{你为什么不派人来解决这个问题？}
### {196}{}{Gee, that's good advice, thanks.}
{196}{}{天啊，这是个好建议，谢谢。}
### {197}{}{We don't have the equipment to deal with it. And personally, I won't risk any lives until our hand is forced. Look, I don't have all the answers, Leonard is the one you should be talking to. If he decides to do something about it, then we can talk some more.}
{197}{}{我们没有处理它的设备。就我个人而言，在我们的手被强迫之前，我不会冒任何生命危险。听着，我不知道所有的答案，你应该和伦纳德谈谈。如果他决定做点什么，那么我们可以再谈一些。}
### {198}{}{You're so incompetent and full of crap! You don't care at all!} #triggers hostility{199}{}{Alright, I guess we'll see each other later.}
{198}{}{You're so incompetent and full of crap! You don't care at all!} #triggers hostility{199}{}{好吧，我想我们待会儿见。}
