{100}{}{OK, this looks clean.}
{101}{}{I'm done here.}
{102}{}{Another cleaning day.}
{103}{}{What a piece of garbage - this is going out.}
{104}{}{Somebody has to check those vents.}
{105}{}{To the next room...}
{106}{}{I got a whole day ahead.}
{107}{}{As good as new.}
{108}{}{Where did I put that soap.}
#
{109}{}{I just clean.}
{110}{}{I can't help you.}
{111}{}{Do you work here, 'cause I don't remember you.}
{112}{}{You better do something useful.}
{113}{}{Did you see my soap?}
{114}{}{I'm sure I put my broom somewhere around here.}
#
{115}{}{I can't help you, sir.}
{116}{}{Good day, sir.}
{117}{}{Hello there. I can clean your room if you want.}
{118}{}{Yes, sir, I'm cleaning.}
{119}{}{I'm doing fine. How are you?}
{120}{}{Hi!}
#
{121}{}{Oh, just leave me.}
{122}{}{I wouldn’t cause any trouble.}
{123}{}{You don't have to kill me.}
{124}{}{I'm getting away from you.}
