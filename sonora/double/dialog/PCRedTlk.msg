### {235}{}{You could say I'm playing my game.}
{235}{}{你可以说我在玩我的游戏。 -- You could say I'm playing my game.}
### {236}{}{The answer is not credible. At least it means we can come to an agreement. The thing is, I want to take Orris' place and reform the gang for the good of the church. If these guys only know how to beat their faces, then at least let them beat the right people.}
{236}{}{答案是不可信的。至少这意味着我们可以达成协议。问题是，为了教会的利益，我想取代奥利斯的位置，改造帮派。如果这些家伙只知道如何打脸，那么至少让他们打对人。 -- The answer is not credible. At least it means we can come to an agreement.

It turned out to be easy, because one of the undead himself was eager to get used to the fire worshippers.}
{269}{}{害怕为了我？哈老实说，我自己也卷入了这件事。大教堂里有人要求转移注意力，以说服食尸鬼合作，因为他们自己无法解决任何问题。事实证明，这很容易，因为其中一个不死生物自己也渴望适应火崇拜者。 -- Fear? For me? Ha! To be honest, I'm involved in this shit myself.
