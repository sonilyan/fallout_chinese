#{100}{}{You see unlucky bum.}

#{111}{}{How did you end up like this?}

#{112}{}{[Leave]}

#{113}{}{You wouldn't believe it. Not so long ago, I used to be the quartermaster of a successful mine! I could have anything I wanted! Money, food, weapons - I could afford it all. And then, just like that, I was fired. [he sadly smiles] That's how it happens, you know - You have everything, and then in a single moment, nothing.}
{113}{}{你不会相信的。不久前，我曾经是一个成功矿井的军需官！我可以得到我想要的任何东西！钱，食物，武器-我都买得起。然后，就这样，我被解雇了。[他悲伤地微笑]事情就是这样发生的，你知道-你拥有一切，然后在一瞬间，什么都没有。}

{115}{}{你是铀城的军需官赖特扔到街上的？}

{117}{}{我可以帮你找回原来的工作。}
#{118}{}{[He looks up, surprised] Really? Well... Great!.. except, what's the point? The mines went to hell. I'd still have nothing to do there.}
{118}{}{[他抬起头，惊讶地]真的吗？好。。。伟大的！。。不过，有什么意义？地雷下地狱了。我在那里还是没什么可做的。}
#{119}{}{The mine is clear. You can return.}
{119}{}{地雷很清楚。你可以回来。}
#{120}{}{Return? Ha... Hahaa! [he throws his head back and laughs hysterically] How can I return?! My wallet and stomach are empty. I'll never make it there alive! Bandits will cut me down before I get ten miles out of the city.}
{120}{}{返回？哈。。。哈哈！[他把头往后仰，歇斯底里地笑]我怎么能回来？！我的钱包和肚子都空了。我再也活不下去了！强盗会在我出城十英里前把我砍倒的。}
#{121}{}{Fine. Let's see if I've got anything...}
{121}{}{好的。我看看有没有什么。。。}
#{122}{}{Here's $50 for provisions.}
{122}{}{这是50美元的给养费。}
#{123}{}{Alright, I'll think about sorting that out.}

#{124}{}{Thank you very much! That'll keep me fed, but walking to the mines is still suicide.}

#{127}{}{No problem. I'll drive you there in my car. Find it and wait for me there.}
{127}{}{没问题。我开车送你去。找到它，在那里等我。}
#{128}{}{[His mouth falls open, staring at the money] Just like that?! You're a real saint! I'll leave as soon as I can. Thank you very much!}
{128}{}{[他的嘴张开，盯着钱]就这样？！你真是个圣人！我会尽快离开。非常感谢你！}
#{129}{}{This isn't for you, this is for the future of Uranium City. Now go, I'll meet you there.}
{129}{}{这不是为了你，而是为了铀城的未来。走吧，我在那儿等你。}
#{130}{}{CAR?! Haven't seen anything like that in a while! I'll go right away. Thank you very much!}
