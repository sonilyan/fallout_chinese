#{100}{}{You see Carl.}
{100}{}{你看到卡尔了。}
#{101}{}{You see a man with big, calloused hands.}
{101}{}{你看到一个长满老茧的大手男人。}
#{102}{}{Can't wait!}
{102}{}{等不及了！}
#{110}{}{Hello. Uh, do you need something?}
{110}{}{你好。呃，你需要什么吗？}
#{111}{}{I was told that a certain Carl lived here. He used to work in Uranium City.}
{111}{}{我听说有个卡尔住在这里。他以前在铀城工作。}
#{112}{}{Nothing really, just looking around.}
{112}{}{没什么，只是四处看看。}
#{113}{}{Ah, well, that's me. Why? Did Wright send you?}
{113}{}{啊，是我。为什么？是莱特派你来的吗？}
#{114}{}{No, Marilyn did. She's getting the workers back together.}
{114}{}{不，是玛丽莲。她让工人们重新团结起来。}
#{115}{}{What? Did they finally sort everything out? No, what am I saying? If they'd sorted things out, Wright would've sent me back.}
{115}{}{什么？他们最终把一切都解决了吗？不，我在说什么？如果他们把事情解决了，赖特会把我送回去的。}
#{116}{}{The mutants are dead. All three of them. The mine can work again, but we need workers.}
{116}{}{变种人死了。他们三个。矿井可以再开采，但我们需要工人。}
#{117}{}{Hm. I'll see what I can do about those problems then.}
{117}{}{嗯。到时候我看看能不能解决这些问题。}
#{118}{}{Hi again.}
{118}{}{又来了。}
#{119}{}{Marilyn sent me. How about returning to Uranium City?}
{119}{}{玛丽莲派我来的。回铀城怎么样？}
#{120}{}{See ya.}
{120}{}{再见。}
#{121}{}{Hey, that's a good news! I'd be happy to come back, but... Listen, I can't leave my family just like that.}
{121}{}{嘿，这是个好消息！我很高兴回来，但是...听着，我不能就这样离开我的家人。}
#{122}{}{What do you need then?}
{122}{}{那你需要什么？}
#{123}{}{I'll need to leave my wife all the money, and it's a long trip to the mine. Mind throwing me 300 bucks for the stagecoach? I'll return it as soon as I get my pay. Honestly!}
{123}{}{我需要把所有的钱都留给我妻子，而且去矿上的路还很长。介意我花300块买驿站马车吗？我一拿到工资就还。说真的？}
#{124}{}{What, is there no other way?}
{124}{}{什么，没有别的办法了吗？}
#{125}{}{Okay, here's 300 bucks. Pack your bags.}
{125}{}{好的，这是300美元。收拾行李。}
#{126}{}{Wait right here, I'll be back.}
{126}{}{在这儿等着，我马上回来。}
#{127}{}{Well, unless you can drive me. But I doubt that you have any transport, ha-ha.}
{127}{}{除非你能开车送我。但我怀疑你有没有交通工具，哈哈。}
#{128}{}{I'll drive you to Uranium City in my car, free of charge.}
{128}{}{我开车送你去铀城，免费。}
#{129}{}{You have a car?! Really?! Oh, wow, that's awesome! I'll pack my bags right away. I've always wanted to ride a car...}
{129}{}{你有车吗？！真正地？！哦，哇，太棒了！我马上收拾行李。我一直想开车...}
#{130}{}{Go to the car and wait for me there. You'll ride in the trunk.}
{130}{}{去车里等我。你坐后备箱。}
#{131}{}{Thank you, friend! See you in Uranium City.}
{131}{}{谢谢你，朋友！铀城见。}
#{132}{}{Goodbye.}
{132}{}{再见。}
#{133}{}{Do you know what happened to Joseph?}
{133}{}{你知道约瑟夫怎么了吗？}
#{134}{}{Honestly, I haven't seen him for a while. After seeing Mr. Wright, he looked very down. Maybe you should ask Mr. Wright about what happened.}
{134}{}{老实说，我有一阵子没见到他了。见到赖特先生后，他很低头。也许你应该问问赖特先生发生了什么事。}
#{135}{}{Can you tell me where I can find Michael?}
{135}{}{你能告诉我在哪儿能找到迈克尔吗？}
#{136}{}{That I can - Michael is living on the streets. Wright kicked him to the curb, and he stayed there. When he was the quartermaster, everyone wanted to be his friend. And now nobody needs him. Crazy how it turns around, huh?}
{136}{}{我可以-迈克尔住在街上。赖特把他踢到路边，他就呆在那里。当他是军需官时，每个人都想成为他的朋友。现在没人需要他了。它转起来真疯狂，哈？}
#{137}{}{The worker will wait in your car. Don't worry about him.}
{137}{}{工人会在你的车里等着。别担心他。}
#{1131}{}{Thank you, friend! See you in Uranium City.}
{1131}{}{谢谢你，朋友！铀城见。}
