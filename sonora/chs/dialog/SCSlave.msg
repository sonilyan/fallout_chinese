### {201}{}{Why?}
{201}{}{为什么？}
### {202}{}{They're always imagining a conspiracy. And when they find a reason, they arrange inspections and even a public flogging. Here with this strictly. One was recently drowned for stealing food from the supreme Paladin. I don't want to be in his place.}
{202}{}{他们总是在想象一个阴谋。当他们找到原因时，他们会安排检查，甚至公开鞭打。这里有严格的这个。其中一人最近因偷最高圣骑士的食物而被淹死。我不想取代他的位置。}

{212}{}{我想问你关于这艘船和兄弟会的事。}
### {213}{}{You're not from the Brotherhood. I'm already risking answering your questions. And what good does that do me, huh? Conversations only tease the stomach.}
{213}{}{你不是兄弟会的。我已经在冒险回答你的问题了。那对我有什么好处？谈话只会刺激胃。}
### {214}{}{Okay. Be.}
{214}{}{可以是}
### {215}{}{Be careful, we may be overheard.}
{215}{}{小心，我们可能会被偷听到。}
### {216}{}{Then do not anger the paladins. Bye.}
{216}{}{那就不要激怒圣骑士。再见}
### {217}{}{You clearly don't understand your situation. Tell me!}
{217}{}{你显然不了解自己的处境。告诉我！}
### {218}{}{Go away or I'll call the paladins!}
{218}{}{走开，否则我会叫圣骑士的！}
### {219}{}{Gr-r...}

### {220}{}{Who are you? You're not in the Brotherhood, are you?}
{220}{}{你是谁？你不在兄弟会，是吗？}
### {221}{}{No way, se?or. See the collar? I'm a prisoner, here's my number.}
{221}{}{没办法，塞诺。看到项圈了吗？我是囚犯，这是我的号码。}
### {1221}{}{No way, se?ora. See the collar? I'm a prisoner, here's my number.}
{1221}{}{不行，塞诺拉。看到项圈了吗？我是囚犯，这是我的号码。}
### {222}{}{Clearly. Another question.}
{222}{}{清晰地另一个问题。}
### {223}{}{Prisoner? But why are you being held against your will?}
{223}{}{囚犯但为什么你被强行关押？}
### {224}{}{I just took a couple of ears from the plantation... Well, a couple of fruits... Actually, not a couple, but a whole bag... But I had to eat something! Now I'm working on the ship until I've served my sentence.}
{224}{}{我刚从种植园里摘了几只耳朵...好吧，几个水果...事实上，不是一对，而是一整袋...但我不得不吃点东西！现在我在船上工作，直到我刑满为止。}
### {225}{}{And are there many people like you serving a sentence here?}
{225}{}{还有很多像你一样的人在这里服刑吗？}
### {226}{}{Only a few servants are kept on the ship, the rest work in different places - on plantations, in ruins, in a cement factory, building houses or simply dragging goods across the desert. I was luckier than them.}
{226}{}{只有少数仆人被留在船上，其余的人在不同的地方工作――在种植园、废墟、水泥厂、建造房屋，或者只是在沙漠中拖着货物。我比他们幸运。}
### {227}{}{And what are you doing here?}
{227}{}{你在这里干什么？}
### {228}{}{For example, I scrub this damn deck four times a day! Or I carry different boxes. The Order constantly receives and sends some parcels.}

### {230}{}{Can you leave here?}
{230}{}{你能离开这里吗？}
### {231}{}{If I run too far from the ship, the collar will explode. This is the invention of scribes. They don't stand on ceremony with the locals here. Besides, they feed me here, and in the wastelands I will have to look for food again. Tough choice, you know.}
{231}{}{如果我离船太远，项圈就会爆炸。这是抄写员的发明。他们在这里不拘泥于当地人。此外，他们在这里喂养我，我将不得不在荒原上再次寻找食物。艰难的选择，你知道。}
### {232}{}{Listen here. Either you give out all the information you know, or you "accidentally" find yourself overboard.}

### {234}{}{I need information.}
{234}{}{我需要信息。}

### {240}{}{What do you know about the Brotherhood of Steel?}
{240}{}{你对钢铁兄弟会了解多少？}
### {241}{}{I know a little, the order doesn't like to talk about themselves. I know that this is just an outpost, and the general staff is located far to the west. And these are the coolest guys in all of Sonora. Even tinkerers can't compare with them.}
{241}{}{我知道一点，秩序不喜欢谈论自己。我知道这只是一个前哨基地，总参谋部就在西边。这些都是索诺拉最酷的家伙。即使是锡匠也无法与他们相比。}
### {242}{}{Clearly. In general, the Brotherhood is not to be trifled with. Let's change the subject.}
{242}{}{清晰地总的来说，兄弟会是不容轻视的。让我们换个话题。}
### {243}{}{Who's in charge here?}
{243}{}{谁是这里的负责人？}
### {244}{}{General Dixon. He is usually in his cabin or in the mess.}

{250}{}{你知道船上的每一个角落，不是吗？}
### {251}{}{No, there's not everywhere you can go. Especially in the lower holds and warehouses.}
{251}{}{不，你不可能去任何地方。尤其是在较低的货舱和仓库。}
### {252}{}{Okay, it doesn't matter.}
{252}{}{好吧，没关系。}
### {253}{}{And what is in the lower holds?}
{253}{}{下层是什么？}
### {254}{}{Torpedo compartment. They say they store explosives there. And there is also a reactor and rats the size of a dog.}
{254}{}{鱼雷舱。他们说他们在那里存放炸药。还有一个反应堆和狗大小的老鼠。}
### {255}{}{Wow, it's worth a look.}
{255}{}{哇，值得一看。}
### {256}{}{Who has the keys to the doors?}
{256}{}{谁有门的钥匙？}
### {257}{}{Everyone has limited access, only the supreme paladin has the keys to all the doors.}
{257}{}{每个人都有有限的通道，只有最高圣骑士拥有所有门的钥匙。}
### {258}{}{Hmm. It seems that the general does not even trust his own in everything.}
{258}{}{嗯。看来将军在任何事情上都不信任自己。}
