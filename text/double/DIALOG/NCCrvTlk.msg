{127}{}{告诉我关于商队的事。 -- Tell me about the caravan business.}
#{128}{}{Reno's got about a dozen independent caravans, but they only work the local market - small-time stuff.

#{143}{}{And the south? Forget it. The barren desert's bad enough, but once you get past that, the land's been scorched with nuclear bombs. The further you go, the worse it gets.

{143}{}{南方呢？算了吧。贫瘠的沙漠已经够糟糕的了，但是一旦你过去了，这片土地就被核弹烧焦了。你走得越远，情况就越糟。他们说只要你走得够远，就会有一座城市，但这不值得你费心。我只听说过一个商队，从那里出发。我从没见过他，但听说他真是一团糟。 -- And the south? Forget it.

#{145}{}{They've actually managed to fix up some old buses from before the war.
