#{100}{}{Caravaneer Biggie.}
{100}{}{大篷车。}
#{101}{}{You see a gloomy caravaneer.}
{101}{}{你看到一个阴沉的商队队员。}
#{102}{}{I was waiting for you at the fence, but you never came. After such a "prank" I don't want even to talk to you.}
{102}{}{我在栅栏边等你，但你一直没来。在这样的“恶作剧”之后，我甚至不想和你说话。}
#{103}{}{Hi.}
{103}{}{你好。}
#{120}{}{Yeah, there's one here. But I don't think you will find him useful. The guy's tragedy is that his caravan was ambushed by raiders. He is the only one survived.}
{120}{}{是的，这里有一个。但我不认为你会发现他有用。这家伙的悲剧是他的车队遭到了袭击者的伏击。他是唯一幸存的人。}
#{121}{}{I still need to talk to him. Tell me where is he?}
{121}{}{我还需要和他谈谈。告诉我他在哪？}
#{122}{}{Do you know anything about this attack?}
{122}{}{你知道这次袭击吗？}
#{123}{}{I don't know exactly where he is now, but surely somewhere in the station. Ask around among the caravaneers.}
{123}{}{我不知道他现在在哪儿，但肯定在车站的某个地方。在商队中四处打听。}
#{124}{}{Only what I heard from the survivor. Raiders attacked at night, shot everyone, and he managed to escape. What kind of raider he couldn't say. That's all.}
{124}{}{只有我从幸存者那里听到的。袭击者在夜间袭击了所有人，他成功逃脱。什么样的袭击者他说不出来。这就是全部。}
#{125}{}{}
{125}{}{}
#{126}{}{I see. No more questions.}
{126}{}{我懂了。没有问题了。}
#{127}{}{Have you met someone from the "Speed Hawk" caravan ?}
{127}{}{你见过“速鹰”商队的人吗？}
#{250}{}{That's great, wanderer. What do you want from a simple worker?}
{250}{}{太好了，流浪者。你想从一个简单的工人那里得到什么？}
#{251}{}{Can you tell me about this place?}
{251}{}{你能告诉我这个地方吗？}
#{252}{}{You said you wanted to take revenge from the technician for the broken vehicle.}
{252}{}{你说你想为那辆坏了的车向技术人员报仇。}
#{253}{}{Nothing. But you need to hold back the voice.}
{253}{}{没有什么。但你得控制住声音。}
#{254}{}{Nothing.}
{254}{}{没有什么。}
#{255}{}{A shitty place. We came here only to have a little water gain. If not for other caravaneers, like hell I would be here by myself.}
{255}{}{一个肮脏的地方。我们来这里只是为了得到一点水。如果不是其他商队，我会一个人呆在这里。}
#{256}{}{Why?}
{256}{}{为什么？}
#{257}{}{Local military men are known bastards. They have discord in their community. They can trap you in the corner and rob you to the bone. And you can prove nothing. So the caravaneers here always go in company, even to the toilet.}
{257}{}{当地的军人都是有名的混蛋。他们在社区里有不和。他们可以把你困在角落里，把你抢走。你什么也证明不了。所以这里的商队总是结伴而行，甚至上厕所。}
#{258}{}{Is it all that bad? Okay, I'll take a note of this.}
{258}{}{有那么糟糕吗？好的，我会记下来的。}
#{259}{}{Hey, look how clever we are!.. Okay, I'm sorry. I was on edge after one story.}
{259}{}{嘿，看我们多聪明啊！。。好吧，对不起。我听了一个故事就紧张起来。}
#{260}{}{Can you tell?}
{260}{}{你能看出来吗？}
#{261}{}{There is one local idiot. He was praised as a person versed in tech, we were told that he was building some thing of the complexity of Vertibird in his garage. So we paid him to fix the wagon. And what? He hits the wagon with a sledgehammer, and the wagon collapses. Then he throws his hands up - not my problems, he says, the wagon was old, it could not stand handling. Can you imagine?!}
{261}{}{当地有个白痴。他被称赞为精通技术的人，我们被告知他正在车库里建造一个类似Vertibird的复杂的东西。所以我们付钱给他修理马车。那又怎样？他用大锤砸了马车，马车就倒了。然后他举起手来――不是我的问题，他说，马车太旧了，经不起搬运。你能想象吗？！}
#{262}{}{But you have to agree - the equipment is really old. You did know that there was a risk.}
{262}{}{但你必须同意-设备真的很旧。你知道有风险。}
#{263}{}{What a bastard! He should have been punched to the face for this.}
{263}{}{真是个混蛋！他应该为此被打一拳。}
#{264}{}{It's hard to say who is right and who is not.}
{264}{}{很难说谁对谁错。}
#{265}{}{Come on! He could reject the offer or rebuild what he broke. But no - he just said "screw you" and threatened us with his friends from the garrison. Such a bitch...}
{265}{}{加油！他可以拒绝这个提议，或者重建他所破坏的东西。但是没有-他只是说“去你的”然后用他驻军的朋友威胁我们。真是个婊子。。。}
#{266}{}{That's what I think, too! But it's not the case. Instead of fixing what was broken, he just said 'screw you' and threatened us with his friends from the garrison. Such a bitch...}
{266}{}{我也是这么想的！但事实并非如此。他没有修理坏了的东西，只是说了句“去你的”，还用他驻军的朋友威胁我们。真是个婊子。。。}
#{267}{}{Well, Yes. Everyone says that, until something like that happens to them. But you know what he did? Instead of fixing what was broken, he just said 'screw you' and threatened us with his friends from the garrison. Such a bitch...}
{267}{}{嗯，是的。每个人都这么说，直到类似的事情发生在他们身上。但你知道他做了什么吗？他没有修理坏了的东西，只是说了句“去你的”，还用他驻军的朋友威胁我们。真是个婊子。。。}
#{268}{}{What did you do?}
{268}{}{你做了什么？}
#{269}{}{We had to deal with it on our own. We fixed the wagon somehow, as for the technician, that would be great to sabotage him somehow, as a goodbye present.}
{269}{}{我们必须自己处理。我们不知何故修好了马车，至于技师，不知何故破坏了他，那就太好了，作为告别礼物。}
#{270}{}{Sabotage is a dangerous thing. Although perhaps in some ways you're right. Good luck.}
{270}{}{蓄意破坏是件危险的事。也许在某些方面你是对的。祝你好运。}
#{271}{}{Okay, the story is clear. Bye.}
{271}{}{好吧，事情很清楚。再见。}
#{275}{}{If I don't get punched in the face, I would be happy. Do you have any suggestions?}
{275}{}{如果我脸上不挨一拳，我会很高兴的。你有什么建议吗？}
#{276}{}{Exactly. I want to rob the son of a bitch. Will you help me climb over the fence to his garage?}
{276}{}{确切地。我想抢这狗娘养的。你能帮我翻过栅栏到他的车库吗？}
#{277}{}{You're afraid of fighting? Nevermind then.}
{277}{}{你害怕打架？那就别管了。}
#{278}{}{Are you out of your mind? Stealing is a risky business!}
{278}{}{你疯了吗？偷窃是一件冒险的事！}
#{279}{}{If you want to avenge him, then this is your only chance.}
{279}{}{如果你想为他报仇，那这是你唯一的机会。}
#{280}{}{Trust me, I know what to do.}
{280}{}{相信我，我知道该怎么办。}
#{281}{}{Then the offer is canceled.}
{281}{}{那么这个提议就取消了。}
#{282}{}{Yes... You're right. OK, I agree.}
{282}{}{对。。。你说得对。好吧，我同意。}
#{283}{}{Maybe so, but those things will not work. I won't participate in the theft. And I won't take any risks}
{283}{}{也许是这样，但这些都行不通。我不会参与盗窃。我不会冒任何风险}
#{284}{}{I understand your doubts, but trust me. I know what to do.}
{284}{}{我理解你的疑虑，但相信我。我知道该怎么办。}
#{285}{}{Then let's not waste time. The conditions now are suitable for plunder.}
{285}{}{那我们就别浪费时间了。现在的条件适合掠夺。}
#{286}{}{You should stay here while I scout out the situation.}
{286}{}{你应该呆在这里等我查清楚情况。}
#{287}{}{How will I be able to trust a passing stranger? Forget it. If I'm to trust someone, then it would be the caravaneers and those who help them.}
{287}{}{我怎样才能相信一个路过的陌生人？算了吧。如果我要信任一个人，那就是那些商队队员和帮助他们的人。}
#{288}{}{Do you even want that revenge? Or you're only full of big talk? Think about it - it's your only chance.}
{288}{}{你想报仇吗？或者你只会说大话？想想看，这是你唯一的机会。}
#{290}{}{You convinced the caravaneer to commit robbery. He will wait for you near the fence next to the garage.}
{290}{}{你说服了商队老板去抢劫。他会在车库旁边的栅栏边等你。}
#{291}{}{Yeah, it would be so pleasant...}
{291}{}{是啊，那太好了。。。}
#{292}{}{This is the best place to climb over the fence. It seems that on the other side there are stairs, so it will not be difficult to go back.}
{292}{}{这是翻越篱笆的最好地方。好像那边有楼梯，回去也不难。}
#{293}{}{Help me to climb up and get back to the tent. You saw nothing and heard nothing.}
{293}{}{帮我爬上去回到帐篷。你什么也没看到，什么也没听到。}
#{294}{}{It is too early to commit sabotage. I'll tell you when you can begin.}
{294}{}{现在进行破坏还为时过早。我告诉你什么时候可以开始。}
#{295}{}{For your actions, you lose karma, but increase sneak skill by 2%.}
{295}{}{对于你的行为，你失去业力，但增加2%的偷袭技能。}
#{296}{}{Calm, don't give yourself away. We're just walking around...}
{296}{}{冷静点，别自暴自弃。我们只是四处走走。。。}
#{1250}{}{That's great, wanderer. What do you want from a simple worker?}
{1250}{}{太好了，流浪者。你想从一个简单的工人那里得到什么？}
#{1278}{}{Are you out of your mind? Stealing is a risky business!}
{1278}{}{你疯了吗？偷窃是一件冒险的事！}
