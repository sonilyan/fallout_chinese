### {100}{}{This is Cadet Presley.}
{100}{}{我是普雷斯利学员。}
### {101}{}{You see one of the recruits.}
{101}{}{你看到一个新兵。}
### {102}{}{Rest in peace, Cadet Presley.}
{102}{}{安息吧，普雷斯利学员。}
### {103}{}{Hey, Cadet, don't you dare die!}
{103}{}{嘿，学员，你不敢死！}
### {104}{}{Good luck on the road.}
{104}{}{祝你在路上好运。}
### {105}{}{The Milton hut is ahead, but we need to find the entrance to the cave.}
{105}{}{米尔顿小屋在前面，但我们需要找到洞穴的入口。}
### {106}{}{Do you have any problems with the Milton family?}
{106}{}{你和米尔顿一家有什么问题吗？}

#The first dialog
### {200}{}{(in front of you is a young cadet with a very dissatisfied look; he sits in an expectant pose and from time to time kicks the garbage under his feet to relieve tension.)}
{200}{}{（你面前是一个年轻的学员，看起来很不满意；他摆出期待的姿势，不时地踢脚下的垃圾来缓解紧张。）}
### {201}{}{Why aren't you in the ranks?}
{201}{}{你为什么不在队伍里？}
### {202}{}{Commander Agatha reprimanded me for my willfulness. What's it to you?}
{202}{}{指挥官阿加莎斥责我的任性。你怎么了？}
### {203}{}{And you're one of the obstinate soldiers, right?}
{203}{}{你是一个固执的士兵，对吧？}
### {204}{}{Damn, I'm just tired of this senseless drill! I want *real* field assignments, not shooting coyotes on caravan routes.}
{204}{}{该死，我只是厌倦了这种无聊的训练！我想要真正的野外任务，而不是在商队路线上射杀郊狼。}
### {205}{}{Looks like you have big ambitions, man.}
{205}{}{看来你有很大的野心，伙计。}
### {206}{}{Maybe so. But I think it's pointless to wait another three years before the first test. If Commander Agatha does not return my equipment and does not let me go to work, I will go there with only one spear.}
{206}{}{也许是这样。但我认为再等三年才能进行第一次测试是毫无意义的。如果指挥官阿加莎不归还我的装备，不让我去上班，我就只带一支长矛去那里。}
### {207}{}{As you know. In the meantime, I'll talk to your commander.}
{207}{}{正如你所知。在此期间，我会和你的指挥官谈谈。}
### {208}{}{You're just a narcissistic bully. Bye, loser.}
{208}{}{你只是个自恋的恶霸。再见，失败者。}
### {209}{}{Don't you dare be rude to me, you greenhorn.}
{209}{}{你敢对我无礼，你这个新手。}

#Repeat dialog
### {210}{}{What do you want?}
{210}{}{你想要什么？}
### {211}{}{Nothing. Later.}
{211}{}{没有什么后来}

### {220}{}{Why did you take the rifle from the warehouse?}
{220}{}{你为什么从仓库里拿走步枪？}
### {221}{}{Combat weapons are issued only for the duration of tasks and training. Besides, cartridges need to be saved. I wanted to take a rifle and go to the cave of Giers Wash. But the quartermaster quickly sensed my plan.}
{221}{}{战斗武器只在任务和训练期间发放。此外，墨盒需要保存。我本想带上一支步枪去Giers Wash的洞穴。但军需官很快就察觉到了我的计划。}
### {222}{}{What is so important in that cave?}
{222}{}{那个山洞里有什么重要的东西？}
### {223}{}{Locals say that rodents live in the cave, and they annoy them a lot. But all the rangers are busy for such a small matter, and the commanders refuse to send cadets, they consider us not ready.}
{223}{}{当地人说洞穴里住着啮齿动物，它们经常惹他们生气。但所有的护林员都在为这样一件小事忙碌，而指挥官拒绝派遣学员，他们认为我们还没有准备好。}
### {224}{}{[Next]}
{224}{}{[下一个]}
### {225}{}{I wanted to deal with the problem alone, to wipe the nose of all the old men with stripes. We have to do something, not shake in the gym!}
{225}{}{我想独自处理这个问题，给所有带条纹的老人擦鼻子。我们必须做点什么，不要在健身房里摇晃！}
### {226}{}{Your dedication inspires respect.}
{226}{}{你的奉献精神使人尊敬。}
### {227}{}{In my opinion, you only wanted to show yourself.}
{227}{}{在我看来，你只是想展示自己。}
### {228}{}{What did you say about the Giers Wash Cave?}
{228}{}{你对Giers Wash洞穴说了什么？}

### {230}{}{Do you get along with the other cadets?}
{230}{}{你和其他学员相处得好吗？}
### {231}{}{It's different with everyone. Some people make me mad, I try to ignore them.}
{231}{}{每个人都不一样。有些人让我生气，我试着忽略他们。}
### {232}{}{I see.}
{232}{}{我明白了。}
### {233}{}{Tell me honestly, you've killed before... a person?}
{233}{}{老实说，你以前杀过...一个人？}
### {234}{}{Not yet. Cadets are sent at best to shoot wolves. But I will kill the criminal bastards, as any ranger should.}
{234}{}{还没有。学员们最多只能被派去打狼。但我会像任何护林员一样杀死那些犯罪的混蛋。}
### {235}{}{I didn't even think about it.}
{235}{}{我甚至没有想过。}

#Quest
### {300}{}{About that outing. We can do it together.}
{300}{}{关于那次郊游。我们可以一起做。}
### {301}{}{Seriously? But why would you risk it?}
{301}{}{认真地但你为什么要冒这个险？}
### {302}{}{I also want to participate in the roundup. It'll be fun.}
{302}{}{我也想参加这次综述。这会很有趣。}
### {303}{}{That's for sure. We are not allowed to shoot from serious weapons, they save ammunition, and it makes sense to shoot from pneumatics only at dead targets.}
{303}{}{这是肯定的。我们不允许用严肃的武器射击，因为它们节省了弹药，而且只对死目标用气动射击是有意义的。}
### {304}{}{I want to help the Rangers in their difficult task.}
{304}{}{我想帮助流浪者队完成他们的艰巨任务。}
### {305}{}{Are you looking for friends among our brother? Tricky. Everyone on the wastelands needs a strong patron.}
{305}{}{你在我们兄弟中间找朋友吗？棘手的荒原上的每个人都需要一位强有力的赞助人。}
### {306}{}{Agatha asked me to keep an eye on you.}
{306}{}{阿加莎让我照看你。}
### {307}{}{Really? Do you think I need a mentor to shoot ordinary rodents? Although... I really could use a partner... and I need a witness, just in case.}
{307}{}{真正地你认为我需要一个导师来射杀普通啮齿动物吗？虽然我真的需要一个合作伙伴...我需要一个证人以防万一。}
### {308}{}{So?}
{308}{}{所以}
### {309}{}{It's a deal! But I can't go there without a gun.}
{309}{}{这是一笔交易！但是没有枪我不能去那里。}
### {310}{}{The extradition order is already on the quartermaster's desk. Thank your supervisor.}
{310}{}{引渡令已经在军需官的办公桌上了。感谢您的主管。}
### {311}{}{What?! How did you manage it?! Cool, I'm going to the warehouse right now. You, too, prepare for a sortie. Meet me outside, near the infocenter.}
{311}{}{什么你是怎么做到的？！酷，我现在就去仓库。你也要做好出击的准备。在外面信息中心附近等我。}

{312}{}{再见}

### {320}{}{I'm ready to move out. And you?}
{320}{}{我准备搬出去了。你呢？}
### {321}{}{Wait a little longer.}
{321}{}{再等一会儿。}
### {322}{}{What can we use?}
{322}{}{我们能用什么？}
### {323}{}{It will be dark in the cave, you should stock up on a couple of flares. And most likely there are a lot of pig rats. Alone they are weak, but all together they can become a problem. The best weapon against such a crowd is a shotgun. However, I have no idea where to get one.}
{323}{}{洞穴里会很黑，你应该储备一些照明弹。而且很可能有很多猪老鼠。他们一个人很弱，但加在一起可能会成为一个问题。对付这样的人群最好的武器是猎枪。然而，我不知道在哪里可以买到。}
### {324}{}{It's worth considering.}
{324}{}{这是值得考虑的。}
### {325}{}{Then let's move out.}
{325}{}{那我们就搬出去吧。}
### {326}{}{Why did we come back? Did you forget something?}
{326}{}{我们为什么回来？你忘了什么吗？}
### {1326}{}{Why did we come back? Did you forget something?}
{1326}{}{我们为什么回来？你忘了什么吗？}
### {327}{}{Don't worry, I won't be long.}
{327}{}{别担心，我不会很久的。}
### {328}{}{Okay, but let's hurry up.}
{328}{}{好吧，但我们快点。}
### {329}{}{OK.}
{329}{}{好啊}
### {330}{}{Such a crowd? This is not the best tactic for cramped caves. Besides, we'll scare the animals away. Someone will have to leave.}
{330}{}{这么多人？对于狭窄的洞穴来说，这不是最好的策略。此外，我们会把动物吓跑的。有人将不得不离开。}
### {331}{}{I'll talk to my partner about it.}
{331}{}{我会和我的搭档谈谈的。}
### {332}{}{Listen, about that story with the Milton family. Let's agree that we have nothing to do with it, okay? I shouldn't have gone on this damn hike. I don't think the pig-rat's head was worth it. Goodbye.}
{332}{}{听着，关于米尔顿家族的故事。让我们同意我们与此事无关，好吗？我不该去远足的。我觉得猪老鼠头不值得。再见。}
### {333}{}{Goodbye, Cadet Presley.}
{333}{}{再见，普雷斯利学员。}
### {334}{}{Why... why did he do it?}
{334}{}{为什么？他为什么这么做？}
### {335}{}{Are you all right?}
{335}{}{你还好吗？}
### {336}{}{I don't know... This bandit... He had a weapon, he could have found another way to survive. But he attacked a defenseless family. Why did he do it?}
{336}{}{我不知道...这个土匪...他有武器，他本可以找到另一种生存方式。但他攻击了一个毫无防御能力的家庭。他为什么这么做？}
### {337}{}{He didn't know any other way.}
{337}{}{他不知道其他办法。}
### {338}{}{I'm no better, right? Now I understand why all this training was needed at the base. And why we are not allowed to important tasks. Now I will take the words of veterans more seriously.}
{338}{}{我也好不到哪里去，对吧？现在我明白了为什么基地需要这些训练。以及为什么我们不被允许执行重要任务。现在，我将更加认真地对待退伍军人的话。}
### {339}{}{Thanks to this outing, you've become a little wiser. Goodbye, cadet.}
{339}{}{多亏这次郊游，你变得更聪明了。再见，学员。}
### {340}{}{Remember the main lesson of the Wasteland - kill or you will be killed yourself. And it's time for me to go back to the desert.}
{340}{}{记住《荒原》的主要教训――杀人，否则你自己也会被杀。是时候让我回到沙漠了。}
### {341}{}{It was a great operation, wasn't it? I'm going to show the head to the others in the dining room. Good luck on the road.}
{341}{}{这是一次很棒的手术，不是吗？我要把这个头像给餐厅里的其他人看。祝你在路上好运。}
### {342}{}{Goodbye, Cadet Presley.}
{342}{}{再见，普雷斯利学员。}

### {350}{}{Keep an eye on the sides.}
{350}{}{注意两边。}
### {351}{}{Let's move on.}
{351}{}{让我们继续前进。}
### {352}{}{So what is our task?}
{352}{}{那么我们的任务是什么呢？}
### {353}{}{Find and kill Nat-Aani. So the locals called the biggest and most dangerous pig-rat of this cave.}
{353}{}{找到并杀死Nat Aani。因此，当地人称这个洞穴中最大、最危险的猪鼠。}
### {354}{}{What does this name mean?}
{354}{}{这个名字是什么意思？}
### {355}{}{Just that he's the leader of the pack. This means that he is the strongest and fiercest of his fellows.}
{355}{}{只是他是团队的领导者。这意味着他是同类中最强壮、最凶猛的。}
### {356}{}{What do you know about the Milton family?}
{356}{}{你对米尔顿家族了解多少？}
### {357}{}{Don't you care? Well, they're ordinary low-income residents. They live mainly by gathering and fishing. There is nothing to tell about them.}
{357}{}{你不在乎吗？他们是普通的低收入居民。他们主要以采集和捕鱼为生。关于他们没有什么好说的。}
### {358}{}{Let's not talk about it.}
{358}{}{我们不要谈论它。}
### {359}{}{What the hell happened with the Miltons? They never seemed to be hostile.}
{359}{}{米尔顿一家到底怎么了？他们似乎从来没有敌意。}

### {360}{}{We did it! I'll cut off this pig's head and show it to the old folks at the base. Now they will know that I am ready for serious business!}
{360}{}{我们做到了！我要把这个猪头剪掉，给基地的老人们看。现在他们会知道我已经准备好做正事了！}
### {361}{}{Is that what you're hunting for?}
{361}{}{这就是你要找的吗？}
### {362}{}{Sure. And why else would I help these beggars? They are of little use, the rewards will not be paid and the reputation will not be raised. But with such a feat of service, I am entitled to at least a double ration. Ha!}
{362}{}{当然否则我为什么要帮助这些乞丐？它们用处不大，不会得到回报，也不会提高声誉。但有了这样的服务壮举，我有权获得至少双倍的口粮。哈}
### {363}{}{Hmm. Let's get out.}
{363}{}{嗯，我们出去吧。}

### {364}{}{What?! Is this a joke? I didn't count on fighting a bandit when I came here!}
{364}{}{什么这是个笑话吗？我来的时候没指望能打土匪！}
### {365}{}{What is it, Cadet? You've just been bloodthirsty rejoicing, cutting off the head of a pig-rat.}
{365}{}{这是什么，学员？你刚才嗜血成性地高兴，割下了一只猪老鼠的头。}
### {366}{}{But this is different! Oh, damn, it's such a bad time... What should I do now?}
{366}{}{但这不一样！哦，该死，这真是个糟糕的时刻...我现在该怎么办？}
### {367}{}{We need to act now. While we wait for help, he will have time to escape or prepare for a siege. Someone will surely die.}
{367}{}{我们现在需要采取行动。当我们等待救援时，他将有时间逃跑或准备围攻。肯定会有人死的。}
### {368}{}{Right. Now we have every chance. He is not expecting our appearance and is busy with other things. But let's be careful - man is not an animal, he is smarter.}
{368}{}{正确的现在我们完全有机会了。他不期待我们的出现，正忙于其他事情。但我们要小心――人不是动物，他更聪明。}
### {369}{}{Let's go.}
{369}{}{我们走吧。}
### {370}{}{We can't stand up to a gunman with a shotgun. We have to escape to the base.}
{370}{}{我们无法对抗持枪歹徒。我们必须逃到基地。}
### {371}{}{Right. But during this time, he will thoroughly prepare himself and will surely kill someone. We'd better get out of here and not tell anyone about this.}
{371}{}{正确的但在这段时间里，他会做好充分的准备，一定会杀人的。我们最好离开这里，不要告诉任何人这件事。}
### {372}{}{Come on.}
{372}{}{来吧}
