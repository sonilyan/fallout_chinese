{234}{}{有什么办法摆脱它们的想法吗？}
### {235}{}{Now it would be a good old shotgun or a detachment of mercenaries from the garrison. In the meantime, I can't even imagine what you can scare them with. They seem to be very superstitious. Otherwise, they would not have placed these totems around the perimeter of the camp.}
{235}{}{现在，它将是一支很好的老式猎枪，或者是一支来自驻军的雇佣兵分队。与此同时，我甚至无法想象你能用什么来吓唬他们。他们似乎很迷信。否则，他们不会在营地周围放置这些图腾。}
### {236}{}{Name the nearest city?}
