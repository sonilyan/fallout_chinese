{100}{}{Here is a croupier.}
{101}{}{You see a neat man in a suit. For a while you watch in fascination how deftly he shuffles the cards.}

#Acquaintance
{200}{}{(There is a table in front of you for playing card games, and at the table a neat man with a serious look deftly shuffles a deck of cards.) Do you play blackjack?}
{201}{}{Not today.}
{202}{}{No, I don't know the rules.}
{203}{}{The call is accepted. But first explain the rules.}
{204}{}{For the most part, this is a kind of blackjack. You need to collect the sum of 21 points with the minimum number of cards with nuclear bombs. Having collected the right number, you can "bomb" the deck. This game requires a little more intelligence than roulette or a slot machine. But the stakes are higher here, too. If, of course, you are willing to take the risk.}
{205}{}{Undoubtedly.}
{206}{}{Are you playing?}
{207}{}{Yes.}
{208}{}{No.}

{225}{}{Good. Let's continue.}
{226}{}{My bet is 50 chips.}

{230}{}{(The dealer takes out two cards and puts them face down. Then he turns one of them over, showing the nominal value in }
