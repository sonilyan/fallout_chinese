{100}{}{Yes, can I help you.}
#
{101}{}{What is this place?}
{102}{}{Nothing.}
#
{103}{}{This is "Stockman's Association". We're something like the banks of the 20th century. People pay us and we
 keep their things safe and sound. We also had a market for coal, but it's been twenty years since that stopped.
 When Miners Town closed its mine, we stopped selling any because our reserves were about zero. [Smiles.] Our
 town is really interested in rebuilding our cooperation with the authorities of Miners Town. If only someone were to
 tell them about our plans.}
#
{104}{}{Why don't you just send a delegate?}
{105}{}{So you think that the deal can be made?}
{106}{}{What's stopping that cooperation?}
#odgovor na delegate
{107}{}{I wish it would be that easy! But they don't want to discuss the matter. There was some earlier incident that
 lead us to where we are now. People refuse even to think about going there... I really don't know how to start
 negotiations.}
#
{108}{}{Maybe I can help.}
{109}{}{I have no idea either. I'll come back later.}
#odgovor na deal can be made
{110}{}{I'm not so sure about that. Last time we went there on peaceful negotiations, we were treated like we were
 some tribals. So the best thing is that we send someone trustworthy who also has connections in Miners Town. We
 haven't come across someone like that so far though. People from this town have a very bad opinion about Miners.
 There is too much bad blood.}
#
{111}{}{You know... You mentioned that you need someone who has connections in Miners Town, I think you just
 found your best candidate.}
{112}{}{People should think about something else than hate. I'm leaving.}
#after 108, 111, 123
{113}{}{You? What makes you think you're qualified?}
#
{114}{}{I happen to know some of the influential people in Miners. And I'm willing to talk with their authorities on
 your behalf.}
{115}{}{Just a thought. You need someone to try and get negotiations started.}
{116}{}{Nope, I changed my mind. It's an issue I don't want to be involved in after all.}
#after 114
{117}{}{If you say you can convince them to start negotiations, I'll let you do it. Keep me informed about your
 progress and good luck.}
{118}{}{Thanks, I'm on it.}
#after 115, fail
{119}{}{I'm glad someone has thoughts about this issue, but that's not enough, we need someone with a real chance of
 success. Don't bother me with your thoughts anymore. My guards will escort you to the front door, and please don't try
 coming back or else you'll be wasted like my time!}
#
{120}{}{That a joke? What about the punch line, bitch!?}
{121}{}{I'll go peacefully.}
#odgovor na what's stopping that cooperation
{122}{}{When we went there with a peace offering, we were attacked. After that experience, I don't even entertain
 thoughts of going back there. Somebody else needs to lead these "peace" negotiations.}
#
{123}{}{I could be your delegate. I think I can wheel that deal for you.}
{124}{}{Yep. I wonder who would be crazy enough to go back there. Good luck.}
#dude se ponovo pojavljuje
{125}{}{Hello again. Can I help you with something?}
#
{126}{}{What news do you bring me? Have you talked with the Miners Town authorities?}
{127}{}{I've talked to the owner of the mine.}
{128}{}{Still working on it.}
#
{129}{}{And? What did he say?}
{130}{}{He is willing to renegotiate your contract and offers his full cooperation if you pay him $3000 every month,
 in advance.}
{131}{}{He doesn't trust you because you didn't pay him last time. Therefore he has a message for you: Farmers'
 citizens are forbidden to come near their town, or they will be shot.}
#after 130, rebuild contract
{132}{}{Our main problem is that we don't have any cash flow, that's why the cooperation ended in the first place. We
 could pull some strings and have the money eventually, but it takes time.}
{133}{}{Is there any way I can help? Maybe I can finance you?}
{134}{}{Well, no money... no deal. I'll go tell him you haven't accepted his terms.}
#
{135}{}{You really are willing to do that?}
{136}{}{Of course, I have the assets and I'd be glad to help.}
{137}{}{On second thought, I don't have that kind of money right now. I'll be back when I have it.}
#
{138}{}{Thank you very much. You just send him the money and we will try to make things right this time.}
{139}{}{Goodbye.}
#
{140}{}{You did what you could. But we're still in a mess. Leave me in peace, I need to find a way to salvage this.}
{141}{}{[Leave.]}
#
{142}{}{Hello again. You have my eternal thanks. You'll always be welcome here.}
{143}{}{Bye.}
#
{144}{}{Sorry, nothing here for you. Door's over there!}
{145}{}{Right.}
#new exit line after 132
{146}{}{Well, I don't know then... maybe something will come up.}
