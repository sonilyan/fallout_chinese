#{309}{}{We have to do something already.}

#{315}{}{We should start negotiating by force.}
{315}{}{我们应该开始武力谈判。}
#{316}{}{It's not too late to go back to work.}
{316}{}{现在回去工作还不晚。}
#{317}{}{If we fight, many miners will die.}
{317}{}{如果我们战斗，许多矿工会死。}
#{318}{}{If we give up, we'll never get another chance to improve our working conditions.}
{318}{}{如果我们放弃，我们就再也没有机会改善工作条件了。}
#{401}{}{Things are tough enough without you.}
{401}{}{没有你一切都很艰难。}
#{402}{}{That's what I needed on top of everything.}
{402}{}{这就是我最需要的。}
#{403}{}{You're just wasting our time.}
{403}{}{你只是在浪费我们的时间。}
#{404}{}{The guards should have taken care of you.}
{404}{}{警卫应该会照顾你的。}
#{405}{}{Get out of the mines.}
{405}{}{离开矿井。}
#{406}{}{We don't need any more trouble.}
{406}{}{我们不需要再麻烦了。}
#{407}{}{What are you trying to do?}

{408}{}{嘿，警卫！}
#{409}{}{Get them!}
{409}{}{抓住他们！}
#{410}{}{Revolt!}

{500}{}{你想要什么？你在矿山没有生意。}
#{501}{}{I heard you were striking.}
{501}{}{我听说你在罢工。}
#{502}{}{I heard you were striking.}
{502}{}{我听说你在罢工。}
#{503}{}{What's going on? Why aren't you working?}
{503}{}{发生什么事？你为什么不工作？}
#{504}{}{Just looking around.}
{504}{}{只是四处看看。}
#{550}{}{Yeah. So what?}
{550}{}{是 啊。那又怎么样？}
#{551}{}{I'd like to know. Can you tell me more?}
{551}{}{我想知道。你能告诉我更多吗？}
#{552}{}{Oh nothing. Bye.}
{552}{}{哦，没什么。再见。}
#{600}{}{We're striking so Nestor improves our working conditions. But hey, what's it to ya?}
{600}{}{我们罢工是为了让内斯特改善我们的工作条件。但是，嘿，这和你有什么关系？}
#{601}{}{I'd like to know. Can you tell me more?}
{601}{}{我想知道。你能告诉我更多吗？}
#{602}{}{Oh nothing. Bye.}
{602}{}{哦，没什么。再见。}
#{650}{}{We toil 'till we drop and we're getting paid so we barely survive. Many miners have already died in this place but nobody cares. Until Nestor gives us a raise or provides better working conditions, we won't work. And if that don't help, we're ready to start using force.}
{650}{}{我们辛辛苦苦地工作，直到我们倒下，我们得到了报酬，所以我们几乎无法生存。许多矿工已经死在这个地方，但没人在乎。在内斯特给我们加薪或提供更好的工作条件之前，我们不会工作。如果没用的话，我们准备开始使用武力。}
#{651}{}{Why don't you just find another job?}
{651}{}{你为什么不另找一份工作呢？}
#{652}{}{How come you start striking now if things have been so bad for so long?}
{652}{}{如果情况这么糟这么久，你怎么现在就开始罢工了？}
#{653}{}{Is that the opinion of all the miners?}
{653}{}{这是所有矿工的意见吗？}
#{654}{}{And you are willing to fight?}
{654}{}{你愿意战斗吗？}
#{655}{}{Stop striking and go back to work.}
{655}{}{别再罢工了，回去工作吧。}
#{656}{}{Strikes never solve anything, you will have to fight for your rights.}
{656}{}{罢工解决不了任何问题，你必须为自己的权利而战。}
#{657}{}{I wish you good luck. Bye.}
{657}{}{祝你好运。再见。}
#{700}{}{And what would we live on, then? It's practically the only job a normal man can land in Corath.}
{700}{}{那我们靠什么生活呢？这几乎是一个普通人在科拉斯唯一能做的工作。}
#{701}{}{How come you start striking now if things have been so bad for so long?}
{701}{}{如果情况这么糟这么久，你怎么现在就开始罢工了？}
#{702}{}{Do all the miners agree with a strike?}
{702}{}{所有矿工都同意罢工吗？}
#{703}{}{And you are willing to fight?}
{703}{}{你愿意战斗吗？}
#{704}{}{Stop striking and go back to work.}
{704}{}{别再罢工了，回去工作吧。}
#{705}{}{Strikes never solve anything, you will have to fight for your rights.}
{705}{}{罢工解决不了任何问题，你必须为自己的权利而战。}
#{706}{}{I wish you good luck. Bye.}
{706}{}{祝你好运。再见。}
#{750}{}{Not so long ago a certain Richie started working here, and he opened our eyes. He said we should do something. Nestor's guards had him locked up for that. That only proves he was right.}
{750}{}{不久前，一个叫里奇的人开始在这里工作，他让我们大开眼界。他说我们应该做点什么。内斯特的警卫因此把他关了起来。那只能证明他是对的。}
#{751}{}{Why don't you just find another job?}
{751}{}{你为什么不另找一份工作呢？}
#{752}{}{Do all the miners agree with a strike?}
{752}{}{所有矿工都同意罢工吗？}
#{753}{}{And you are willing to fight?}
{753}{}{你愿意战斗吗？}
#{754}{}{Stop striking and go back to work.}

#{755}{}{Strikes never solve anything, you will have to fight for your rights.}
{755}{}{罢工解决不了任何问题，你必须为自己的权利而战。}
#{756}{}{I wish you good luck. Bye.}
{756}{}{祝你好运。再见。}
#{800}{}{Do you see anybody working around here? Everyone is waiting for what the five of us can negotiate. They are relying on us, we must not fail them.}
{800}{}{你看到有人在这附近工作吗？每个人都在等待我们五个人能谈成什么。他们依赖我们，我们不能辜负他们。}
#{801}{}{So if I kill you to set an example, it should convince the other miners to forget about strikes. Suits me.}
{801}{}{所以，如果我杀了你以身作则，应该能说服其他矿工忘掉罢工。适合我。}
#{802}{}{Why don't you just find another job?}
{802}{}{你为什么不另找一份工作呢？}
#{803}{}{How come you start striking now if things have been so bad for so long?}
{803}{}{如果情况这么糟这么久，你怎么现在就开始罢工了？}
#{804}{}{And you are willing to fight?}

#{806}{}{Strikes never solve anything, you will have to fight for your rights.}
{806}{}{罢工解决不了任何问题，你必须为自己的权利而战。}
#{807}{}{I wish you good luck. Bye.}
{807}{}{祝你好运。再见。}
#{850}{}{If it becomes necessary, we are. Just like all them miners. The situation between us and Nestor's men is pretty tense already. I guess all it will take is one gunshot and everyone would start killing each other.}
{850}{}{如果有必要的话，我们会的。就像所有矿工一样。我们和内斯特手下的关系已经很紧张了。我想只要一声枪响大家就会开始互相残杀。}
#{851}{}{So you're saying that if some stranger attacked one of the guards, the miners would start fighting?}
{851}{}{所以你是说如果有陌生人袭击其中一个守卫，矿工们会开始战斗？}
#{852}{}{Why don't you just find another job?}
{852}{}{你为什么不另找一份工作呢？}
#{853}{}{How come you start striking now if things have been so bad for so long?}
{853}{}{如果情况这么糟这么久，你怎么现在就开始罢工了？}
#{854}{}{Do all the miners agree with a strike?}

{856}{}{罢工解决不了任何问题，你必须为自己的权利而战。}
#{857}{}{I wish you good luck. Bye.}
{857}{}{祝你好运。再见。}
#{900}{}{Exactly. The strike's been futile for very long now and the boys are getting impatient.}
{900}{}{确切地。罢工已经很长时间没有结果了，孩子们都不耐烦了。}
#{901}{}{Just to clarify, how do I tell who's a guard and who's a miner?}
{901}{}{我要澄清的是，我该如何区分谁是守卫谁是矿工？}
#{902}{}{Why don't you just find another job?}
{902}{}{你为什么不另找一份工作呢？}
#{903}{}{How come you start striking now if things have been so bad for so long?}
{903}{}{如果情况这么糟这么久，你怎么现在就开始罢工了？}

{906}{}{罢工解决不了任何问题，你必须为自己的权利而战。}
#{907}{}{I wish you good luck. Bye.}
{907}{}{祝你好运。再见。}
#{950}{}{A guard is any fella with a gun. Say, what do you want anyway? Better get lost, and don't let me see you 'round here again.}
{950}{}{警卫是指任何带枪的人。你到底想要什么？最好滚开，别让我再看到你在这附近。}
#{951}{}{[Leave.]}
{951}{}{[离开]}
#{1000}{}{This isn't a good spot for a stroll, even if we're not working right now.}
{1000}{}{这不是散步的好地方，即使我们现在不工作。}
#{1001}{}{Why aren't you working?}
{1001}{}{你为什么不工作？}
#{1002}{}{I'm going.}
{1002}{}{我要走了。}
#{1050}{}{Who the hell are you? You're not gonna tell us what to do.}
{1050}{}{你到底是谁？你不会告诉我们该怎么做的。}
#{1051}{}{You've been working here long enough to know Nestor doesn't give a shit about you.}
{1051}{}{你在这里工作的时间够长了，知道内斯特根本不在乎你。}
#{1052}{}{I'll give you 1000 caps if you convince the other miners to stop striking. [Show them the money.]}
{1052}{}{如果你说服其他矿工停止罢工，我就给你1000顶瓶盖。[把钱给他们看。]}
#{1053}{}{You don't feel like working? I'll kill you to show the others that striking isn't the best idea either.}
{1053}{}{你不想工作吗？我要杀了你，让其他人知道打人也不是最好的主意。}
#{1054}{}{I'm sorry. So long.}
{1054}{}{我很抱歉。这么久。}
#{1100}{}{Yeah? Just what do you mean?}
{1100}{}{是 啊？你什么意思？}
#{1101}{}{He'll never improve your working conditions. He'd rather have you all shot and replaced by fresh meat, someone willing to work.}
{1101}{}{他永远不会改善你的工作条件。他宁愿把你们都枪毙，换成鲜肉，一个愿意工作的人。}
#{1102}{}{That I'll give you 1000 caps if you convince the other miners to strop striking. [Show them the money.]}
{1102}{}{如果你说服其他矿工罢工，我会给你1000个上限。[把钱给他们看。]}
#{1103}{}{You don't feel like working? I'll kill you to show the others that striking isn't the best idea either.}
{1103}{}{你不想工作吗？我要杀了你，让其他人知道打人也不是最好的主意。}
#{1104}{}{Oh nothing, just forget it.}
{1104}{}{哦，没什么，算了吧。}
#{1150}{}{We won't let him. We'll fight and force him to meet our demands. Or force him to die, if necessary.}
{1150}{}{我们不会让他的。我们要战斗，迫使他满足我们的要求。或者在必要的时候强迫他死。}
#{1151}{}{Do you really think that could work? Even if you're lucky you'll only kill the guards down here in the mines, but Nestor has many more. And what's more, you'd have the police against you. You don't stand a chance.}
{1151}{}{你真的认为这样行吗？即使你很幸运，你只会在矿井里杀死守卫，但内斯特还有很多。更重要的是，警察会对你不利。你没有机会了。}
#{1200}{}{Damn, you're right. It's hopeless. We'd better get back to work before they shoot us like a bunch of rabid dogs.}
{1200}{}{妈的，你说得对。没希望了。我们最好在他们像一群疯狗一样射杀我们之前回去工作。}
#{1201}{}{Well... life can be a bitch. Bye.}
{1201}{}{好。。。生活可以是个婊子。再见。}
#{1250}{}{Shit. I've never seen so many caps in one pile in my life.}
{1250}{}{倒霉。我这辈子从没见过这么多瓶盖一堆。}
#{1251}{}{Sharing it with everyone won't achieve much, but for the five of you it's a nice bonus which you don't need to mention anywhere.}
{1251}{}{与每个人分享它不会有多大的成就，但对于你们五个人来说，这是一个很好的奖励，你不需要在任何地方提及。}
#{1252}{}{And you never will again, because I will personally kill you and your four buddies here and now to show the others there's no point in striking.}
{1252}{}{你永远也不会再这样了，因为我会亲自杀了你和你的四个兄弟，现在就让其他人知道没有必要再打了。}
#{1253}{}{And you never will again, because I will personally kill you and your four buddies here and now to show the others there's no point in striking.}
{1253}{}{你永远也不会再这样了，因为我会亲自杀了你和你的四个兄弟，现在就让其他人知道没有必要再打了。}
#{1254}{}{And you never will again. [Hide the money.] Bye.}
{1254}{}{你再也不会这样了。[把钱藏起来]再见。}
#{1300}{}{Oh well, you never can help everyone, so we best just help ourselves. [The others are nodding in agreement, intently watching the offered sum.] We'll convince them somehow that a strike wasn't a good idea. [He takes the caps.]}
{1300}{}{哦，好吧，你永远帮不了每个人，所以我们最好自己动手。[其他人点头表示同意，专注地注视着报价。]我们会以某种方式说服他们罢工不是个好主意。[他接过瓶盖。]}
#{1301}{}{Now you're talking.}
{1301}{}{现在你说话了。}
#{1350}{}{Who the hell are you? You're not gonna tell us what to do.}
{1350}{}{你到底是谁？你不会告诉我们该怎么做的。}
#{1351}{}{Nestor is a tyrant and you must face him! A strike will never solve anything, brute force is the only thing Nestor understands! If you all fight together, you'll achieve your goals and Nestor'll never know what hit him!}
{1351}{}{内斯特是个暴君，你必须面对他！罢工永远解决不了任何问题，暴力是内斯特唯一了解的！如果你们一起战斗，你会实现你的目标，内斯特永远不会知道是什么击中了他！}
#{1352}{}{I'll give you 1000 caps if you convince the other miners to start fighting. [Show them the money.]}
{1352}{}{如果你说服其他矿工开始战斗，我就给你1000个上限。[把钱给他们看。]}
#{1353}{}{I'm sorry. Bye.}
{1353}{}{我很抱歉。再见。}
#{1400}{}{You're right! We've been striking for a very long time and nothing's happening. It's time to strike for real! We're all ready.}
{1400}{}{你说得对！我们已经罢工很长时间了，什么都没发生。是时候真正罢工了！我们都准备好了。}
#{1401}{}{Let's get to fighting!}
{1401}{}{我们开始战斗吧！}
#{1450}{}{Shit. I've never seen so many caps in one pile in my life.}
{1450}{}{倒霉。我这辈子从没见过这么多瓶盖一堆。}
#{1451}{}{For the five of you this should be a nice little reward for helping the others finally do something with their lives. Of course no-one ever need to know you got this.}
{1451}{}{对于你们五个人来说，这应该是一个很好的小奖励，帮助其他人最终完成他们的生活。当然没人需要知道你有这个。}
#{1452}{}{And you never will again. [Hide the money.] Bye.}
{1452}{}{你再也不会这样了。[把钱藏起来]再见。}
#{1500}{}{Yeah, a reward. We're helping them after all, so why shouldn't we get rewarded, right? [The others are nodding in agreement, intently watching the offered sum.] OK, we'll get things rolling, everyone's eager to fight anyway. [He takes the caps.]}
{1500}{}{是的，奖励。我们毕竟是在帮助他们，为什么我们不能得到回报呢？[其他人点头表示同意，专注地注视着提供的金额。]好吧，我们会让事情进展顺利的，不管怎样，每个人都渴望战斗。[他接过瓶盖。]}
#{1501}{}{Now you're talking.}
{1501}{}{现在你说话了。}
#{1550}{}{What do you want? You have no business in the mines.}
{1550}{}{你想要什么？你在矿山没有生意。}
#{1551}{}{What can you tell me about your strike?}
{1551}{}{关于你的罢工你能告诉我什么？}
#{1552}{}{I'm just looking around.}
{1552}{}{我只是四处看看。}
