{110}{}{[但以理在地上吐唾沫]这地方是一堆脏东西。这里一切都不对劲。需要做点什么！但每个人都害怕行动，因为他们害怕我的爸爸。我是唯一一个毫不犹豫地公开说他错了的人。此外，阿森和他的父亲丹也同意我的观点。}

{115}{010}{是的，我们拭目以待。现在――另一个问题。}

### {120}{}{[you see a fire in his eyes] I will knock down half of the local buildings to build new ones! I'll chase all the shits out of town, so only the cool guys would stay! Arsene is going to help, Dan too. And mom. Together we are strong!}

{140}{}{[丹尼尔满意地笑了笑]大事总是发生――这就是我们所做的。我们震撼了这个地方！我们最后的工作包括解决政治僵局、提高生产率和防灾。你想听些什么？}

### {150}{}{There was some chick here, trying to get on Dan, saying that he knows nothing about politics. So, me and Arsene threw a rotten Lavash head into her window! Can you imagine that?! Now she keeps her mouth shut! You could say it's plus additional vote for us!}
{150}{}{这里有个小妞，试图讨好丹，说他对政治一无所知。所以，我和阿森把一个腐烂的熔岩头扔进了她的窗户！你能想象吗？！现在她守口如瓶！你可以说这是对我们的额外投票！}
### {151}{016}{Oh, I see. Tell me about production rate improvement.}
{151}{016}{哦，我明白了。告诉我生产率提高的情况。}

### {153}{010}{I want to ask other questions.}
{153}{010}{我想问其他问题。}

### {160}{}{A day before we secretly snuck into the canned meat factory. And Arsene poured a whole bucket of machine oil into the meat! Which lead to producing ten cans of meat more than usual! People didn't notice anything. The taste and smell got worse though, but they still eat it, no worries. }
{160}{}{前一天，我们偷偷溜进了罐头肉工厂。阿森把一整桶机油倒进肉里！这导致比平时多生产了十罐肉！人们什么也没注意到。虽然味道和气味都变差了，但他们仍然会吃，不用担心。}
### {161}{017}{You didn't happen to pour something like this into the Lavash food, did you?}

### {163}{018}{Tell me about disaster prevention.}
{163}{018}{告诉我有关防灾的事。}
### {164}{035}{[As in all conversation, you are carefully observing the one you speak to. You notice the silhouette of the oil bottle in his inner pocket] You do smell some machine oil now, you know that? Here's the bottle sticking out. Do you want to pour it somewhere again? }
{164}{035}{[在所有的谈话中，你都在仔细观察与你交谈的人。你注意到他内口袋里油瓶的轮廓]你现在确实闻到了一些机油的味道，你知道吗？瓶子伸出来了。你想再倒一次吗？}
### {165}{010}{Another question then.}
{165}{010}{那又是一个问题。}

### {170}{}{Of course! We added some oil into it too. There's more food this way!}
{170}{}{当然我们也往里面加了一些油。这边有更多的食物！}
### {171}{010}{I want to ask something else.}
{171}{010}{我想问别的问题。}
### {172}{999}{I see. I'll go do my things, see you.}
{172}{999}{我明白了。我会去做我的事情，再见。}

### {180}{}{One asshole wanted to get two of his friends into NWO, so they agreed to meet at dawn, on the outskirts of the town. Can you imagine three assholes in the NWO? It is a disaster! I can barely tolerate one. So, we boarded up his doors and windows at night, he didn't make it to his friends, and they left. That's it!}
{180}{}{一个混蛋想把他的两个朋友带到NWO，所以他们同意在黎明时分在城郊见面。你能想象NWO里有三个混蛋吗？这是一场灾难！我几乎无法忍受。所以，我们晚上用木板封住了他的门窗，他没能去见他的朋友，他们就走了。就是这样！}

{190}{}{丹是阿森的父亲。一个聪明的人！对政治的了解无人能及。他说的是对的，我和阿尔塞纳都喜欢听他的。有时我不太明白丹想告诉我们什么，但这绝对很重要。}

{203}{999}{我去和她谈谈。再见}

### {210}{}{[Daniel ponders] I have no idea. Somehow? What matters is that I know how to knock them down, and the locals will handle building new ones. What else they would do? }
{210}{}{[丹尼尔沉思]我不知道。以某种方式重要的是，我知道如何拆除它们，当地人会负责建造新的。他们还会做什么？}
### {211}{012}{Okay. So, what are your plans for the town?}
{211}{012}{可以那么，你对这个城市有什么计划？}
### {212}{010}{I'll ask something else.}
{212}{010}{我会问别的问题。}

### {2200}{}{I will throw all the shits out of the town, all of them! Though, I still need to decide, which ones. Ghouls for sure, I hate them! I'll drive them all off, except Sam.}
{2200}{}{我会把所有的垃圾都扔出去的，所有的！不过，我仍然需要决定，哪一个。食尸鬼当然，我讨厌他们！我会把他们都赶走，除了萨姆。}

{221}{023}{你为什么不开车离开萨姆？}
### {222}{010}{Another question then.}
{222}{010}{那又是一个问题。}

### {230}{}{Because he is my grandpa. He can stay. Even if he smells a mile away... But the other ones will be chased away!}
{230}{}{因为他是我爷爷。他可以留下来。即使他闻起来有一英里远。。。但其他人会被赶走的！}

{233}{999}{我明白了。我去和萨姆谈谈。再见。}

### {2400}{}{My father is a Mayor, his name is Mark. I don't want to talk about him, we don't see each other much. I hang out with Arsene mostly, so I talk to his father more than with mine.}
{2400}{}{我父亲是市长，他的名字叫马克。我不想谈论他，我们很少见面。我大部分时间都和阿尔塞纳在一起，所以我和他的父亲交谈比和我的父亲交谈更多。}

### {242}{010}{I'll ask something else.}
{242}{010}{我会问别的问题。}

### {250}{}{[Daniel cringes] Meh, pops doesn't know what he is doing. He lost it for a long time already. Look what swamp NWO has become! As Arsene says, "Dying Lavash won't give a good offspring". And I completely agree.}
{250}{}{[丹尼尔退缩了]哦，爸爸不知道他在做什么。他已经丢了很长时间了。看看NWO变成了什么沼泽！正如阿森所说，“死亡的熔岩不会产生好的后代”。我完全同意。}
### {251}{026}{What Arsene actually means by that?}
{251}{026}{阿森的话到底是什么意思？}
### {252}{027}{It's not so bad around here. You have food, water. Work.}

{262}{027}{但问题到底出在哪里呢？这里还不错。你有食物和水。工作}

### {270}{}{[Daniel starts actively gesturing. Metal things on his clothes start to chime a little] This is all bullshit! We are capable of doing much more! We could run the whole world if we want to!}
{270}{}{[丹尼尔开始积极地做手势。他衣服上的金属物开始有点叮当作响]这都是胡说八道！我们有能力做得更多！如果我们愿意，我们可以管理整个世界！}
### {271}{028}{And what needs to be done about it?}
{271}{028}{对此需要做些什么？}
### {272}{010}{I'll ask something else.}
{272}{010}{我会问别的问题。}

### {280}{}{[Daniel is waving hands even more energetically, metal things on his clothes are chiming loudly] Who the hell cares! First, we need to destroy everything old around here, and then to think about what to do next!}
{280}{}{[但以理更用力地挥着手，衣服上的金属物在大声鸣叫]谁在乎呢！首先，我们需要摧毁这里的一切旧东西，然后考虑下一步该怎么办！}

### {295}{010}{Okay. Another question.}
{295}{010}{可以另一个问题。}

### {300}{}{Yeah, pops is pretty sick. And soon I'll inherit the Mayor's position. I feel sorry for the pops, of course, but he is doing his job pretty sick. Would be better if he put me into Mayor already, and got some rest.}
{300}{}{是的，爸爸病得很重。很快我将继承市长的职位。当然，我为爸爸们感到难过，但他工作得很糟糕。如果他已经让我当市长，休息一下会更好。}
### {301}{034}{I talked to your father. He doesn't want you to be the Mayor. But I think you are right, so just pretend you want to reform. When you become Mayor, you can do whatever you want.}
{301}{034}{我和你父亲谈过了。他不想让你当市长。但我认为你是对的，所以假装你想改革。当你成为市长后，你可以做任何你想做的事。}

{330}{}{[丹尼尔兴奋地跳了起来。他的金属声听起来像旋律]就是这样！你知道，你很酷！你马上就注意到这个地方需要改变！}

{332}{999}{当然你开始改变，我需要完成一些事情。再见}

### {340}{}{[Daniel blushes. but quickly calms down] Yes, pops can put me into trouble. Your idea might work... Okay, I'll pretend. And then I'll show them!!}
{340}{}{[丹尼尔脸红了。但很快平静下来]是的，爸爸会给我带来麻烦。你的想法可能会奏效。。。好吧，我假装。然后我给他们看！！}

### {342}{999}{Agreed. I'll go talk to your father.}
{342}{999}{同意。我去和你爸爸谈谈。}

### {350}{}{[Daniel seems a little confused] Uh, I thought it's well-hidden in my pocket... Okay, here's a secret for you - me and Arsene decided to put some of the machine oil into Lavash food, to cut costs, so to say. They don't care, we have profit.}
{350}{}{[丹尼尔似乎有点困惑]嗯，我以为它藏在我的口袋里。。。好吧，这是你的一个秘密――我和阿森决定在熔岩食品中加入一些机油，可以说是为了降低成本。他们不在乎，我们有利润。}

{361}{037}{我认为你在生产线上会做得很好。在装载阶段。}
### {362}{040}{I'm watching you.}
{362}{040}{我在看着你。}
### {363}{999}{Nevermind. I'll go.}
{363}{999}{没关系。我去。}

### {370}{}{Wh- What? What did you say?}
{370}{}{什么？你说什么？}
### {371}{038}{I said that starting today you work in a factory. We are all equal here, so it doesn't look good when someone does nothing for the common good. }
{371}{038}{我说从今天开始你在工厂工作。我们在这里都是平等的，所以当有人不为共同利益做任何事情时，这看起来并不好。}
