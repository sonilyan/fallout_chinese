We will need all the help we can get.}

#{2554}{}{I'll go with you, but first I want to look around.}
{2554}{}{我和你一起去，但首先我想四处看看。}
#{2600}{}{Not much. Being a caravan guard I'm only interested in two things - where to get booze and where to get guns. There's plenty of booze in the Wild Paradise, the luxurious brothel courtesy of madame Chow, guns and ammo are sold by that slimebag Chuck in a shop of his own. You'll find both just a few steps away in the Hunters' Territory.}
{2600}{}{不多。作为一名商队警卫，我只对两件事感兴趣――去哪里买酒和去哪里买枪。野生天堂里有很多酒，有周夫人提供的豪华妓院，枪械和弹药都是那个笨蛋在自己的商店里卖的。两人都会在几步之外的猎人领地找到。}

#{2800}{}{We're finally here. The goods get unloaded here in The Suburbs. Too bad about all the dead guys. They were good guards. It won't be easy to replace them. Here, this is yours.
