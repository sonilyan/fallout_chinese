### {1202}{}{Let's do this quick, I have a lot of work to do... I need to get my collection of fingers organized.

{1202}{}{让我们快点做吧，我有很多工作要做…我需要整理我的手指收藏。[他用步枪穿过一个侧面有一个钢狗脸的皱巴巴的盒子]来，看看这个，我是从猪那里借的。[他愤怒地眯着眼睛]如果我知道事情会变成这样――我会把这脏东西整脑袋都拿走！我他妈的要杀了他！}

{124}{999}{那我就不麻烦你了。我稍后再来。}
### {1203}{}{Do I look like a fucking guide to you? Huh? Are you the fucking interviewer? [He gets angrier with every word, his voice sounding like raspy roaring] I thought when the Hog is dead, I'm gonna fucking breath a little. But you, freaks, are still trying to piss me off, aren't you? Huh? TALK, YOU FUCKING SHIT!}
{1203}{}{我看起来像你的导游吗？嗯？你是他妈的面试官吗？[他对每一个字都越来越生气，他的声音听起来像刺耳的咆哮]我想当猪死了的时候，我会他妈的喘口气。但你们这些怪胎还在想惹我生气，不是吗？嗯？说话，你他妈的混蛋！}
### {125}{015}{Looks like you think you are immortal. Want me to arrange a meeting with the Hog for you?}

### {1204}{}{Let's do this quick, I have a lot of work to do... I need to get my collection of fingers organized. [He rifles through a crumpled box with a steel dog faces on the side] Here, check this one out, I borrowed it from the Hog. [he angrily squints] Too bad that I didn't get to cut off his head! He got lucky - I was not the one who got to him first...}
{1204}{}{让我们快点做吧，我有很多工作要做…我需要整理我的手指收藏。[他用步枪穿过一个侧面有一个钢狗脸的皱巴巴的盒子]来，看看这个，我是从猪那里借的。[他愤怒地眯着眼睛]可惜我没能把他的头砍下来！他很幸运――我不是第一个找到他的人。。。}
### {128}{016}{Care to tell me more about you and your guys?}
{128}{016}{想告诉我更多关于你和你手下的事吗？}
### {129}{999}{Yeah, it happens. Well, I need to go.}
{129}{999}{是的，它确实发生了。好吧，我得走了。}


### {130}{}{What are you implying?! That Jackals are not good enough for something?! Although... Wait, stand still for now... [He starts pondering, poking with hand into steel plate on his caved armor. Suddenly he violently rips it off. But when he talks to you again, his voice sounds more or less calm.] So here's my question - are you good at hunt?}
{130}{}{你在暗示什么？！那个豺狼还不够好？！虽然等等，现在站着不动。。。[他开始思考，用手戳破他那凹陷的盔甲上的钢板。突然他猛地把它扯了下来。但当他再次和你说话时，他的声音听起来或多或少很平静。]所以我的问题是――你擅长狩猎吗？}
### {131}{020}{Good? I can find a fly by its trace in the air!}
{131}{020}{好的我能在空中找到一只苍蝇的踪迹！}
### {132}{020}{Can do something, yes. Why do you ask?}

### {134}{999}{Uh... I've just remembered I have some business to take care of. See you later.}
{134}{999}{嗯我刚刚想起我有一些事情要处理。回头见。}


### {140}{}{[He pats you on the shoulder] Nice job! Perhaps I'm not only going to leave your fingers intact but will also give you an honest reward. [He puts down the rifle with powerful optics from his back, and reloads it a couple of times, checking smoothness of mechanism] Such a good toy... Exactly for you. Now you'll be able to shoot any beast between the eyes from a mile away.}
{140}{}{[他拍了拍你的肩膀]干得好！也许我不仅会让你的手指完好无损，还会给你一个诚实的奖励。[他从背后放下装有强大光学系统的步枪，重新装弹几次，检查机械装置的平稳性]这么好的玩具。。。完全适合你。现在，你可以从一英里外射杀任何野兽。}
### {141}{012}{A pleasure doing business with you. I still have a couple of questions though.}
{141}{012}{很高兴和你做生意。不过我还有几个问题。}
### {142}{015}{Is that it? Do you even realize what does it take to kill a Chimera? I bet you took other teeth from old and dead ones...}
{142}{015}{就是这样吗？你知道杀死奇美拉需要什么吗？我敢打赌你从老的和死的牙齿上拿走了其他牙齿。。。}
### {143}{999}{Thanks, Loudmouth. Big gun means big future! See you around.}
{143}{999}{谢谢，Loudmouth。大炮意味着伟大的未来！回头见。}


### {150}{}{[You see how last little bits of humanity leave his yellow eyes. Looks like you went a little overboard] You! YOU FUCKING FILTH! Do you REALIZE who are you barking on?? [he starts to pull out the pistol] I murdered SO MANY PEOPLE for MUCH less!! Maybe I need ANOTHER necklace, MADE OUT OF YOUR TEETH?!}
{150}{}{[你看最后一点点人性是如何离开他黄色的眼睛的。看起来你有点过火了]你！你这个混蛋！你知道你在对谁吠叫吗？？[他开始拔出手枪]我以更低的代价谋杀了这么多人！！也许我需要另一条项链，用你的牙齿做的？！}
### {151}{021}{Woah, chill, chill! You had it all wrong, I never intended to insult you! My sincerest apologies, the thunder of the Radius! Let's do it like that - I'll leave and we forget about this misunderstanding?}
{151}{021}{哇，冷静，冷静！你完全错了，我从来没有打算侮辱你！我最诚挚的歉意，雷霆万钧！让我们这样做吧――我走了，我们就忘了这个误会？}
### {152}{017}{You can scare your pet bitches all you want, shithead - It won't work on me! Now I'm gonna strangle you with your own intestines!}
{152}{017}{你可以随心所欲地吓唬你的宠物婊子，混蛋――这对我不起作用！现在我要用你自己的肠子勒死你！}


### {160}{}{We are the Sunset Jackals!! We are the ones who take what they want by right of might! As my father used to say - real men satisfy their hunger only with the blood of their victims, their kids get to sleep only with the screams of dying enemies for a lullaby! All the fucking wasteland knows and remembers the Jackal and his pack! And don't you dare to get in our way...}
{160}{}{我们是日落豺狼！！我们是那些凭实力为所欲为的人！正如我父亲常说的那样――真正的男人只有用受害者的血来充饥，他们的孩子只有在垂死的敌人为摇篮曲发出的尖叫声中才能入睡！所有他妈的荒原人都知道并记得豺狼和他的背包！你敢挡我们的路吗。。。}
### {161}{018}{I see. You mentioned someone named Hog. Who is that?}
{161}{018}{我明白了。你提到一个叫霍的人。那是谁？}
### {162}{015}{Hah! Why don't you said so earlier? Another pathetic gang of shitty raiders. Only with attitudes...}
{162}{015}{哈哈！你为什么不早点说？又是一群卑鄙的袭击者。只有态度。。。}
### {163}{022}{Looks like your father meant real business. I'd like to learn more about him.}
{163}{022}{看来你父亲是认真的。我想进一步了解他。}
### {164}{999}{Fully understood. Well, I should go.}
{164}{999}{完全理解。好吧，我该走了。}


### {170}{}{[You see foam coming from the corner of his mouth, veins on the neck are starting to pop out] That's it... NO EASY DEATH FOR YOU, SLUDGY PIECE OF SHIT!! Boys, let's show that bitch - and don't touch fingers, they are mine!!!}
{170}{}{[你看到他的嘴角冒出泡沫，脖子上的静脉开始冒出来]就这样……你的死不容易，黏糊糊的一块！！孩子们，让我们看看那个婊子――别碰手指，它们是我的！！！}
### {171}{998}{It's showtime!}
{171}{998}{表演时间到了！}


### {180}{}{[He is not amused by the question] I had one fucking degenerate in my crew before. Brought me no real benefits, only problems. And I allowed him to get away with so much! So what if I cut off his finger once? He pissed me off that time... Looks like he decided he can be something more - and took over some factory, turning it into a narcotics lab. Now he not only produces the shit, but he also puts half of it into his own rotten fat ass. Fucking junkie...}
{180}{}{[他对这个问题一点也不好笑]我以前的船员中有一个他妈的堕落。没有给我带来真正的好处，只有问题。我允许他逍遥法外！如果我把他的手指切掉一次怎么办？那次他惹我生气了。。。看起来他决定做更多的事情，接管了一家工厂，把它变成了毒品实验室。现在他不仅生产粪便，还把一半放进了自己腐烂的肥屁股里。他妈的瘾君子。。。}
### {181}{019}{I see you don't like him much. Maybe he should be dealt with? I can help with that.}
{181}{019}{我看你不太喜欢他。也许他应该被处理？我可以帮忙。}
### {182}{016}{I agree, it's so difficult to assemble a good team... By the way, what can you tell me about your other guys?}
{182}{016}{我同意，组建一支优秀的团队太难了。。。顺便问一下，你能告诉我关于你其他人的什么？}
### {183}{999}{I see. See you around.}
{183}{999}{我明白了。回头见。}

### {190}{}{Node019}
{190}{}{节点019}
### {191}{}{Well thank you VERY fucking MUCH! How we were doing here without YOUR fucking help? Listen to this - I DON'T GIVE A FLYING SHIT ABOUT HOG, HIS ASSHOLE OF A GANG, YOU, OR A WHOLE DAMN WORLD!! I don't even care if I die today or tomorrow, you hear me?!}
{191}{}{非常感谢你！没有你的帮助我们在这里过得怎么样？听我说――我不会对霍、他的混蛋、你或整个该死的世界嗤之以鼻！！我甚至不在乎我是今天死还是明天死，听到了吗？！}
### {192}{999}{Suit yourself, I was just asking. See you then.}
{192}{999}{随便你吧，我只是问。到时见。}


### {200}{}{[looks at you skeptically] Yeah, sure, you walking dog food... Okay, what do I lose? Here's the situation - lately there's the rumor going that I piss my pants every time the word "Chimera" is said. And that there's some asshole with the rifle in rotten NWO, who, unlike me, can shoot these creatures dead easy-peasy. I have no time to spare shutting up every fucking pie hole, so I decided to deal with all of them simultaneously - see this necklace? That's Chimera's teeth. But I'm too busy now to walk around wastelands getting the shit. This is where you come into the picture. Kill off a couple of Chimeras and bring me their fangs, the longest ones! I need three in total. The Jackals are having their hands full, so my bet is on the fact that someone like you would carry the task. You won't regret it - I have some very good rifles, someone who knows their stuff about guns would really appreciate them.}
{200}{}{[怀疑地看着你]是的，当然，你在遛狗。。。好吧，我会失去什么？情况是这样的――最近有传言说，每次听到“Chimera”这个词，我都会尿裤子。在腐烂的NWO里有一个拿着步枪的混蛋，和我不同，他可以轻而易举地射杀这些生物。我没有时间把每个他妈的馅饼洞都关上，所以我决定同时处理所有这些――看到这条项链了吗？那是奇美拉的牙齿。但我现在太忙了，没时间在荒原上走来走去。这就是你进入画面的地方。杀死几只奇美拉，把它们最长的獠牙带给我！我总共需要三个。豺狼队忙得不可开交，所以我打赌像你这样的人会承担这项任务。你不会后悔的――我有一些非常好的步枪，了解枪支知识的人会非常感激它们。}
### {201}{999}{Deal. I'll come back soon, get the guns ready.}
{201}{999}{处理我很快就会回来，把枪准备好。}
### {202}{012}{No, it's too risky. I'll pass. Better answer some questions.}
{202}{012}{不，太冒险了。我会通过的。最好回答一些问题。}
### {203}{999}{I need to think about it. Be back soon.}
{203}{999}{我需要考虑一下。很快回来。}


### {210}{}{Sure, we'll forget about it, no problem. You'll just leave... [Suddenly he punches you in the jaw - and you feel how the spikes of his glove rip through your skin] IF YOU WILL BE ABLE TO WALK ON THAT PIECES OF MEAT WE'LL LEAVE YOU WITH, INSTEAD OF YOUR LEGS!! [He turns to raiders] HEY, JACKALS! HERE'S YOUR DOG FOOD!!}
{210}{}{当然，我们会忘记的，没问题。你就这样离开。。。[突然他打了你一拳，你感觉到他的手套尖刺是如何撕裂你的皮肤的]如果你能在那块肉上行走，我们会给你留下的，而不是你的腿！！[他转向袭击者]嘿，夹克！这是你的狗粮！！}
### {211}{998}{Today's a very bad day...}
{211}{998}{今天是非常糟糕的一天。。。}


### {220}{}{My father was - and always will be - the best of all Jackals! He has been preparing me for the role of pack leader since I was a boy. He was always letting me shoot some freaks in the face - and if I did good, he allowed me to keep fingers. I have a whole box of them!}
{220}{}{我的父亲曾经是――而且永远是――所有豺狼中最好的！从我小时候起，他就一直在为我扮演队长的角色做准备。他总是让我朝一些怪胎的脸开枪――如果我做得好，他允许我保留手指。我有一整盒！}
### {221}{018}{Oh. Yeah, he should be proud - you learned so well. And who's that Hog you mentioned before?}
{221}{018}{哦是的，他应该感到骄傲――你学得这么好。你之前提到的那个猪是谁？}
### {222}{023}{Hah! And I've heard that your childhood wasn't all rainbows and unicorns, know what I mean?}
{222}{023}{哈哈！我听说你的童年并不全是彩虹和独角兽，知道我的意思吗？}
### {223}{999}{Sure, childhood memories are so great. Well, let's stop for now. See you!}
{223}{999}{当然，童年的记忆是如此美好。好吧，让我们暂时停下来。再见}


### {230}{}{[He moves forward with an intimidating look. His sticking mohawk makes him look like a lizard] What the fuck are you getting at?}
{230}{}{[他带着恐吓的表情向前走。他那扎人的莫霍克让他看起来像只蜥蜴]你他妈的在干什么？}
### {231}{017}{I'm getting at the times you've been wetting yourself and crying your shit out. I guess that's why they call you Loudmouth, eh? Mad respect to your father for enduring for so long - If I were him, I would choke the little rat, like you, right at birth...}
{231}{017}{我有时会被你弄湿，哭得屁滚尿流。我想这就是他们叫你大声说话的原因吧？疯狂地尊敬你的父亲，因为他能忍受这么长时间――如果我是他，我会像你一样，一出生就掐死这只小老鼠。。。}
### {232}{999}{Uh, um... Just rumors, nothing serious. Well, it's time for me to go.}
{232}{999}{呃，嗯…只是谣言，没什么大不了的。好吧，我该走了。}


### {2401}{}{[He is definitely not in the mood and the sight of you doesn't make it better] Why the hell I see you ventilating your balls near the door to my bitch, you dirty rat poop?! ANSWER ME!!}
{2401}{}{[他肯定没有心情，看到你也不会让事情变得更好]为什么我看到你在门附近把你的蛋蛋通风给我的婊子，你这个脏老鼠屎？！回答我！！}
### {241}{030}{What? I didn't even know there was someone in there! I just liked this door, you know... I love doors.}
{241}{030}{什么我甚至不知道里面有人！我只是喜欢这扇门，你知道。。。我喜欢门。}
### {242}{025}{There's no one inside anyway! I've just seen her walking out and going riiiight there...}
{242}{025}{里面一个人也没有！我刚刚看到她走出去，去了那里。。。}
### {243}{026}{At last I found you! I have a piece of very important information, you're gonna thank me later!}
{243}{026}{我终于找到你了！我有一条非常重要的信息，你稍后会感谢我的！}
### {244}{999}{How would I know that she is yours? Okay, I'm leaving...}
{244}{999}{我怎么知道她是你的？好吧，我要走了。。。}
### {2402}{}{[Loudmouth is annoyed with something - as usual. But seeing you he calms down a little] Oh, hotshot! The hell are you doing here?}
{2402}{}{[像往常一样，Loudmouth对一些事情很恼火。但看到你，他冷静了一点]哦，太棒了！你在这里干什么？}
### {245}{032}{Yeah, the Radius is a tight place... I was just walking by. How about you? Why are you here?}
{245}{032}{是的，半径是一个紧张的地方。。。我只是路过。你呢？你为什么在这里？}
### {246}{999}{I was coming by... And going. Don't want to spoil your date. Bye!}
{246}{999}{我来了…然后就走了。不要破坏你的约会。再见}


### {250}{}{[He suspiciously moves his eyes from door to you and back] Why the hell she would go there, I wonder?}
{250}{}{[他怀疑地把目光从门口移到你们身上再移回来]我想知道她为什么要去那个里？}
### {251}{029}{Well, I've managed to eavesdrop that she looks for the cleaner puddle to do her make-up because she wants to see you in better shape. She was very excited about that. You are so lucky!}
{251}{029}{嗯，我偷听到她找更干净的水坑化妆，因为她想看到你的身材更好。她对此非常兴奋。你真幸运！}
### {252}{029}{Uh... Um... I don't know, maybe a stomach ache?}
{252}{029}{嗯嗯…我不知道，也许是胃疼？}
### {253}{026}{It can wait. I have a piece of important information for you.}
{253}{026}{它可以等待。我有一条重要信息要告诉你。}
### {254}{999}{How would I know? Deal with it yourself, I'm out of here...}
{254}{999}{我怎么会知道？你自己处理，我离开这里。。。}


### {260}{}{[He menacingly approaches you] The fuck? What could you possibly have to tell me?!}
{260}{}{[他威胁性地接近你]他妈的？你能告诉我什么？！}
### {261}{027}{I recently eavesdropped on a couple of your Jackals - I'm very curious, you know... So, I've heard them talking about something important and snuck upon them...}
{261}{027}{我最近窃听了你们的几只豺狼――我很好奇，你知道。。。所以，我听到他们在谈论一些重要的事情，然后偷偷溜到他们身上。。。}
### {262}{027}{Yes, you are right, don't know what came over me... But your girl isn't there, I saw her walking away in that direction, just before you arrived.}
{262}{027}{是的，你是对的，不知道我发生了什么……但你的女孩不在那里，我看到她朝那个方向走去，就在你到达之前。}
### {263}{999}{I have nothing to do here, sorry. I won't stop you anymore.}
{263}{999}{对不起，我在这里没什么事可做。我不会再阻止你了。}


### {270}{}{[He spit at everything around when he talks] What? Snuck? The one like you couldn't sneak even upon a blind and deaf Jackal! Try to piss into my ears one more time and I will turn your insides out!! Got it? Now fucking shoo, pick up the speed!!}
{270}{}{[他说话时随地吐痰]什么？恶心？像你这样的人连一个又聋又瞎的豺狼都不能偷袭！再往我耳朵里撒尿一次，我会把你的内脏翻出来的！！明白了吗？现在他妈的嘘，加快速度！！}
### {271}{031}{Be that as it may, you won't enter this room.}
{271}{031}{不管怎样，你都不能进入这个房间。}
### {272}{999}{I see, I'm going...}
{272}{999}{我明白了，我要去。。。}
### {273}{}{[He tries to hide it, but your words definitely sparked some interest in him] Why did you stop? Go on.}
{273}{}{[他试图隐瞒，但你的话肯定引起了人们对他的兴趣]你为什么停下来？继续}
### {274}{028}{Of course, I can't tell for sure - there was dark there, and what I've heard was not very clear... But in short, they were planning to catch up with the Hog's man at some factory, near the water barrels. They meet in an hour, today.}
{274}{028}{当然，我不能确定――那里很黑，我听到的也不太清楚。。。但简而言之，他们计划在水桶附近的某家工厂赶上猪的人。他们今天一小时后见面。}
### {275}{999}{You know, I've just remembered something! I need to run. Catch you later, 'kay?}
{275}{999}{你知道，我刚刚想起了一些事情！我需要跑步。待会儿见，好吗？}


### {280}{}{A Hog's man? Another bitch running away to join this pig? Fucking assholes!! [With a rabid look, he reaches for the gun - but almost immediately comes to his senses] True or not, I need to check it. Right fucking now!! [he turns around and hastily walks away]}
{280}{}{猪的男人？另一个婊子跑去加入这头猪？他妈的混蛋！！[带着狂热的表情，他伸手去拿枪，但几乎立刻恢复了理智]不管是真是假，我都需要检查一下。现在他妈的！！[他转身匆匆离去]}
### {281}{999}{Good luck! And you're welcome.}
{281}{999}{祝你好运不客气。}


### {2901}{}{YOU are gonna fucking get your stomach ache, you fucking joker!! Get out of my sight or I'll tear you a new one!!}
{2901}{}{你他妈的会肚子疼的，你这个他妈的小丑！！滚出我的视线，否则我会给你撕一个新的！！}
### {291}{031}{I'm not going anywhere. And you are not getting into this room, fuckwad.}
{291}{031}{我哪儿也不去。你不能进这个房间，他妈的。}
### {292}{999}{Already leaving.}
{292}{999}{已经离开了。}
### {2902}{}{[He scratches his head] That's what she said? Hmm... Okay, I'll come by later... But I don't want to see you here when I come back! [walks away with a satisfying look]}
{2902}{}{[他挠了挠头]她就是这么说的？嗯…好的，我稍后再来。。。但是我回来的时候不想在这里看到你！[满意地走开了]}
### {293}{999}{Sure, sure, I'm leaving.}
{293}{999}{当然，当然，我要走了。}


### {300}{}{I'm gonna fuck you up so hard if you don't disappear now, asshole!!}
{300}{}{如果你现在不消失，我会狠狠地揍你的，混蛋！！}
### {301}{026}{Just a moment! I have a piece of important information for you!!}
{301}{026}{请稍等我有一条重要信息要告诉你！！}
### {302}{025}{Why are you in such a hurry? She already left anyway. Somewhere... There!}
{302}{025}{你为什么这么着急？无论如何，她已经离开了。在某处那里}
### {303}{999}{Hey, calm down! I'm going.}
{303}{999}{嘿，冷静！我要走了。}


### {310}{}{[He seems enjoyed by the turn of event] You know, I won't even ask why are you so stubborn. I'm just gonna enter the room - after I wash my face with your blood! [reaches for a weapon]}
{310}{}{[他似乎很喜欢事态的发展]你知道，我甚至不会问你为什么这么固执。我正要进房间――等我用你的血洗脸后！[伸手去拿武器]}
### {311}{998}{Nice! I didn't kill anyone for a long time!! }
{311}{998}{美好的我很久没有杀人了！！}
### {312}{998}{Maybe we still can talk it over? No?...}
{312}{998}{也许我们还可以讨论一下？不}


### {320}{}{I decided to come by my bitch... She is the trophy, after all. Okay, was nice to see you and all that, but I have no time to beat around the bush here.}
{320}{}{我决定带着我的婊子来。。。毕竟，她是奖杯。好吧，很高兴见到你和所有这些，但我没有时间在这里拐弯抹角。}
### {321}{033}{You can relax - she ran away in that direction five minutes ago. But maybe you can still try to catch up.}
{321}{033}{你可以放松――她五分钟前朝那个方向跑了。但也许你仍然可以努力赶上。}
### {322}{999}{Agree. Well, good luck.}
{322}{999}{同意好吧，祝你好运。}


### {3301}{}{I'm gonna do just that! She shouldn't fucking run around for no reason, I'll deal with it! Okay, see you. [slowly walks away]}
{3301}{}{我就这么做！她不应该无缘无故地到处乱跑，我会处理的！好的，再见。[慢慢走开]}
### {331}{999}{Good luck?...}

### {332}{034}{We are not finished talking. You are not going anywhere.}
{332}{034}{我们还没说完。你哪儿也不去。}
### {333}{999}{Yeah, sure, go in.}
{333}{999}{是的，当然，进去。}


### {340}{}{[He comes closer with an evil grin] So cheeky today, aren't you, hotshot? Maybe I should beat some respect into you...}
{340}{}{[他恶狠狠地咧嘴笑了笑]你今天真是厚颜无耻，是吗，辣妹？也许我应该尊重你。。。}
### {341}{998}{Go ahead, you bitch! Come here!}
{341}{998}{去吧，你这个婊子！过来！}
### {342}{998}{Why do we always have to resort to violence? Hey, put your hands away from there!}
{342}{998}{为什么我们总是要诉诸暴力？嘿，把手放远！}


### {350}{}{[You fail to finish the sentense] The HOG?! You are his new BITCH, aren't you?! Bitch so stupid that you came straight to me?! ALONE?! [He pulls out a huge knife, cutting his other palm. The blood starts to drip on the floor] Just when I needed new fingers for my collection...}
{350}{}{[你没能完成这句话]HOG？！你是他的新伙伴，不是吗？！婊子，愚蠢到你直接来找我？！一个人？！[他拿出一把大刀，割破了另一只手掌。血开始滴在地板上]就在我需要新手指来收集的时候。。。}
### {351}{036}{Hey-hey, easy! It's in your own interests!! Just listen for a minute, it won't take long.}
{351}{036}{嘿，嘿，轻松！这符合你自己的利益！！只要听一分钟，不会花很长时间的。}
### {352}{017}{Put away the knife, bozo. Or I'm gonna cut off something yours. For MY collection.}
{352}{017}{把刀收起来，博佐。或者我要剪掉你的东西。用于我的系列。}
### {353}{036}{Listen, you know me well. And I realize who I'm talking with here.  I wouldn't put myself into dealing with Hog for no reason, be sure about that.}
{353}{036}{听着，你很了解我。我意识到我在这里和谁说话。我不会无缘无故地和霍格打交道，这是肯定的。}


### {3601}{}{I don't fucking believe you! Trying to fuck me up?! I'm going to rip off your rotten tongue and send it to Hog as a gift!! GET HIM, BOYS!!}
{3601}{}{我他妈的不相信你！想搞砸我？！我要扯下你腐烂的舌头，把它作为礼物送给霍格！！抓住他，伙计们！！}
### {361}{998}{Not the best of my negotiations...}
{361}{998}{不是我最好的谈判。。。}
### {3602}{}{[He calms down a little, but the knife stays in his hand] What this fucking PIG could possibly offer?! We are wasting time here... }
{3602}{}{[他稍微冷静了一下，但刀仍在他手中]这只该死的猪能提供什么？！我们在这里浪费时间。。。}
### {362}{037}{So, here's the deal - the Hog wants to make peace. Yes, I know what you're going to answer. But first, think about it - Rainbow is the only supplier of the Drop, and if the war starts, where are you going to get yours? }
{362}{037}{所以，协议是这样的――猪想要和平。是的，我知道你要回答什么。但首先，想想看――彩虹是Drop的唯一供应商，如果战争开始，你将从哪里得到你的？}
### {363}{037}{I've seen the Rainbow's defenses and military forces. Even if you succeed in taking over them, your losses will be disastrous. How are you going to protect your territory after that? It's wiser to bid your time and don't go into direct conflict with the Hog.}
{363}{037}{我见过彩虹号的防御和军事力量。即使你成功地接管了他们，你的损失也将是灾难性的。在那之后，你将如何保护你的领土？更明智的做法是争取时间，不要与猪发生直接冲突。}
### {364}{037}{I managed to sign up a very profitable trading agreement with the Rainbow. Considering the approximated volume of deliveries, you are selling weapons and buying the Drop at a very good price. So use it! With the big money assets, the Jackals will grow so strong that the Rainbow itself will come asking you for protection! And that's when you deal with the Hog.}
{364}{037}{我设法和彩虹公司签订了一份利润丰厚的贸易协议。考虑到大致的交付量，您正在以非常好的价格出售武器并购买Drop。所以用它吧！有了这些巨额资产，豺狼将变得如此强大，以至于彩虹本身也会来请求你的保护！那就是你对付猪的时候。}
### {365}{039}{Right! I'm here only to tell you this - the Hog is afraid of the Jackals! The negotiations for peace are a sign of weakness! It's time to strike!!}
{365}{039}{正确的我来这里只是想告诉你――猪害怕豺狼！和平谈判是软弱的表现！是时候罢工了！！}
### {366}{999}{Believe me, you are wrong. But I need to check on some facts. See you later.}
{366}{999}{相信我，你错了。但我需要核实一些事实。回头见。}


### {370}{}{[While you speak, Loudmouth only grins, holding the bloody knife in his hand] You talk is smooth, I give you that. But something smells fishy here... [a thug approaches him and starts to quietly explain something] You too?! Okay, piss off for now... [he looks back at you] Here's the thing - we are gonna discuss it with the boys, and you stand still and don't make a sound.}
{370}{}{[你说话的时候，Loudmouth只是咧嘴一笑，手里拿着带血的刀]你说话很顺利，我同意。但是这里有点腥味。。。[一个暴徒走近他，开始悄悄地解释什么]你也是？！好吧，暂时别生气。。。[他回头看着你]事情是这样的――我们要和孩子们讨论，你站着不动，不发出声音。}
### {371}{038}{Okay, no problem. I hope you'll make a good decision.}
{371}{038}{好的，没问题。我希望你能做出一个好的决定。}


### {380}{}{[You stay in the company of two thuggish Jackals, who are busy with a very intellectual dialogue about better ways to skin a man alive. Unfortunately, when the most interesting part starts, Loudmouth comes back with his other men] Here's the answer - tell Hog that we'll take the deal. We won't touch them for now. And we will even sell the next batch of "merchandize" with a discount... A little excessive, as for me. [He glances at one of his guards] But if there ANY reason, even a little one - I fucking let loose all my Jackals and drown the whole Rainbow in blood! Got it?!}
{380}{}{[你和两个凶残的豺狼在一起，他们正忙于一场非常理智的对话，讨论如何更好地活剥一个人的皮。不幸的是，当最有趣的部分开始时，Loudmouth和他的其他人回来了]答案是――告诉Hog，我们会接受这笔交易。我们暂时不会碰他们。我们甚至会打折出售下一批“商品”。。。对我来说，这有点过分。（他瞥了一眼他的一名警卫）但如果有什么原因的话，哪怕是一个小小的原因――我他妈的放走了我所有的豺狼，把整个彩虹都淹死在血里！明白了吗？！}
### {381}{999}{Great. I'll tell that to Hog. Was nice having business with you, but I've got to go.}
{381}{999}{太棒了我会告诉霍格的。很高兴能和你做生意，但我得走了。}


### {390}{}{[He puts a knife away and pats you on the shoulder] Ha! I knew it! He doesn't have the balls to go against me! Now he's definitely done... But not now. Later. If you want to join the fun, just say, we'll find you something to do. Will pick fingers for me, haha.}
{390}{}{[他收起一把刀拍了拍你的肩膀]哈！我就知道！他没有胆量和我对抗！现在他肯定完成了。。。但现在不行。后来如果你想加入这个乐趣，就说，我们会给你找点事做。我会帮你挑手指的，哈哈。}
### {391}{999}{Ahem... What an honor. Okay, that's it for me, I won't be bothering you anymore.}
{391}{999}{啊。。。多么荣幸啊。好吧，就这样，我不会再打扰你了。}


### {4001}{}{[He gently strokes his mohawk, looking at you from under his brows] You are a fast little bastard, aren't you? Just keep in mind, hotshot - Jackals WILL take over the Rainbow. Even if I die before it happens. So - enjoy your life, while you can... And while all your fingers are intact.}
{4001}{}{[他轻轻地抚摸着他的莫霍克，从眉毛下看着你]你是个速度很快的小混蛋，不是吗？请记住，大热门-豺狼将接管彩虹。即使我在它发生之前就死了。所以，享受你的生活，而你可以。。。而你所有的手指都完好无损。}
### {401}{017}{Is that so? You know what, let's deal with it right now! Mad animals should be put down!}
{401}{017}{是这样吗？你知道吗，让我们现在就处理它！疯狂的动物应该被放倒！}
### {402}{999}{I'll remember that. But you too stay focused. Good luck, Loudmouth.}
{402}{999}{我会记住的。但你也要保持专注。祝你好运，Loudmouth。}
### {4002}{}{[He crouches a little as if he wants to throw himself at you] Do I suddenly need to get full of respect now?! Listen here, asshole - I DON'T GIVE A FUCK! WHO! YOU!! ARE!! Here you matter LESS than yesterday's PUKE!!! DO YOU HEAR ME?!?}
{4002}{}{[他蹲了一下，好像想扑向你]我现在突然需要得到充分的尊重吗？！听着，混蛋，我一点也不在乎！世界卫生组织！你！！是！！在这里，你比昨天的PUKE更重要！！！你听到了吗？！？}
### {403}{017}{I see you don't understand who are you barking on?! You gonna cough with blood after we finished, bitch!}
{403}{017}{我看你不明白你在对谁吠叫？！我们结束后你会流血咳嗽的，婊子！}
### {404}{999}{Sure, sure. You should come by us sometimes. You won't be disappointed, I promise. Just tell us in advance, we'll dig some graves for your guys. See you around, Jackal.}
{404}{999}{当然，当然。你有时应该来找我们。我保证你不会失望的。只要提前告诉我们，我们会为你们挖一些坟墓。再见，豺狼。}
### {409}{999}{At least it's honest. Okay, we'll see how it turns out eventually.}
{409}{999}{至少它是诚实的。好吧，我们拭目以待。}
### {4003}{}{[He literally looks you over from every side] How someone like YOU could take down the Hog?! I bet I would do it fucking faster. Anyway - soon the Rainbow's gonna be ours! I'm gonna impale every fucking one of them on stakes, those shit-eating junkies!! Don't wait for me to thank you though - I wanted to fuck up this fangy pig bitch myself.}
{4003}{}{[他真的从四面八方看着你]像你这样的人怎么能把猪取下来？！我打赌我会做得更快。不管怎样，彩虹很快就会成为我们的了！我要把他们每个人都钉在木桩上，那些吃屎的瘾君子！！不过，别等我来感谢你――我想亲自去搞这个尖牙的猪婊子。}
### {405}{017}{How? I can show you. If you are still good for something except babbling.}
{405}{017}{怎样我可以给你看。如果你仍然擅长某些事情，除了胡言乱语。}
### {406}{999}{I can live with that. See you around, Jackal.}
{406}{999}{我可以接受。再见，豺狼。}
### {4004}{}{[He shakes his head so hard that you see the cloud of dust goes up from his mohawk] How the hell did that happen?! It should have been ME who put him down!! FUCK!!! Although there IS one thing that pleases me - the rainbow is now ours for sure... Okay, get the fuck where you wanted to. Do not piss me off.}
{4004}{}{[他使劲摇头，你可以看到他的莫霍克发型上飘起了一团灰尘]这是怎么回事？！应该是我把他打倒的！！操！！！尽管有一件事让我高兴――彩虹现在肯定是我们的了。。。好吧，去你想去的地方。别惹我生气。}
### {407}{017}{You know, it was me who put the Hog down. And I'm going to do the same to you. Right now.}
{407}{017}{你知道，是我把猪放倒了。我也会对你做同样的事。马上}
### {408}{999}{Okay. See you then.}
{408}{999}{可以到时见。}
