{211}{}{因为一个人，这座城市不会从地球上消失。冷静}
### {212}{}{I'm calm. Yes, I am calm. I just found myself a normal fucking job. And now, because of an accident, I'm back on the street. Without work, without caps and without connections. What should I do now?}
{212}{}{我很冷静。是的，我很冷静。我刚刚找到了一份正常的工作。现在，因为一场事故，我又回到了街头。没有工作，没有盖子，没有连接。我现在该怎么办？}

### {215}{}{Really. Any ideas?}

### {216}{}{Well, you can go to robbers. And why not? There are many caravans, but I am alone. It's okay, it's necessary to survive somehow.}

### {300}{}{Tell me about the count.}

### {302}{}{Why is he called a graph?}

### {310}{}{Who are you?}
{310}{}{你是谁？}
### {311}{}{I'm just a security guard.}
{311}{}{我只是一个保安。}
### {312}{}{Are you local?}
{312}{}{你是本地人吗？}
### {313}{}{No, from a small community near Phoenix. The community went bankrupt, so I went to the big city. Things didn't work out there either, so I joined the caravan to earn caps. But they left me here on the way. I haven't seen the caravan since. Hell, they didn't even pay me the full amount.}
{313}{}{不，来自菲尼克斯附近的一个小社区。社区破产了，所以我去了大城市。那里的情况也不太好，所以我加入了大篷车来赚取瓶盖。但他们在路上把我留在了这里。从那以后我再也没见过大篷车。见鬼，他们甚至没有全额付给我。}
### {314}{}{Have you been working here as a security guard since then?}
{314}{}{从那以后你一直在这里当保安吗？}
### {315}{}{No, just a few months. The count needed people, and there was no one among the locals to recruit for protection. Otherwise I wouldn't be here.}
{315}{}{不，只有几个月。伯爵需要人手，而当地人中没有人可以招募保护人员。否则我就不会在这里了。}
### {316}{}{And correctly. No one needs a useless "ballast" on the tail.}
{316}{}{而且是正确的。没有人需要一个无用的“压舱物”在尾巴上。}
### {317}{}{I'm not useless! And why are you asking me? You'd better go your own way, Uncle. I don't have to talk to you at all.}
{317}{}{我不是没用的！你为什么问我？你最好走自己的路，叔叔。我根本不用和你说话。}
### {1317}{}{I'm not useless! Don't, lady, I know these ladies' tricks. You'd better go your own way. I don't have to communicate with you at all.}
{1317}{}{我不是没用的！别这样，女士，我知道这些女士的把戏。你最好走自己的路。我根本不需要和你交流。}
### {318}{}{Well, well.}
{318}{}{嗯，嗯。}
### {319}{}{I have to go.}
{319}{}{我得走了。}
### {320}{}{By the way, why are these streets so deserted?}
{320}{}{顺便问一下，为什么这些街道如此冷清？}
### {321}{}{This isn't Phoenix, it's a small town here. But I don't understand either. After all, there are a lot of bottlecaps and caravans often pass here.}
{321}{}{这不是凤凰城，这是一个小镇。但我也不明白。毕竟，这里经常有很多瓶子车和大篷车经过。}
### {322}{}{And it already began to seem to me that this is another ghost town. Okay, I'm going for a walk.}
{322}{}{在我看来，这已经是另一座鬼城了。好吧，我要去散步。}
### {323}{}{It turns out that you were taken out of desperation. I'm wasting my time with you.}
{323}{}{事实证明，你是出于绝望才被带走的。我在浪费时间和你在一起。}
### {324}{}{Surely the count understood who he was hiring. I need to meet him.}
{324}{}{伯爵当然明白他在雇谁。我需要见见他。}
### {325}{}{What an injustice. You definitely don't deserve this.}
{325}{}{多么不公正啊。你绝对不配这样。}
### {326}{}{Exactly. I hope they were eaten by radscorpions. But now I work in a good position with a normal salary. Great, right?}
{326}{}{确切地我希望它们被蝎子吃掉了。但现在我的工作很好，薪水也很正常。很棒，对吧？}
### {327}{}{You're just lucky. Make no mistake.}
{327}{}{你真幸运。别搞错了。}
### {328}{}{Well yes. By the way, it's time for me to see your employer. Bye.}
{328}{}{是的。顺便说一句，我该去见你的雇主了。再见}
