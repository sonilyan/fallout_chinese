#{100}{}{You see Machete.}
{100}{}{你看到弯刀了。}
#{101}{}{You see a powerful-looking bodyguard. Just one look at him makes you want to bury your head in the sand.}
{101}{}{你看到的是一个看起来很强大的保镖。只看他一眼，你就会想把头埋在沙子里。}
#{105}{}{Boss is dead! It's all over!}
{105}{}{老板死了！一切都结束了！}
#{110}{}{Hold it! You're standing in the house of Mr. Luciano. What do you want with the boss?}
{110}{}{别动！你站在卢西亚诺先生的房子里。你想跟老板怎么样？}
#{111}{}{I need to talk to him.}
{111}{}{我要和他谈谈。}
#{112}{}{[He nods in greeting] Boss is waiting for you.}
{112}{}{[他点头致意]老板在等你。}
#{113}{}{Nothing, actually, I'm here for something else.}
{113}{}{没什么，事实上，我是来找别的事的。}
#{114}{}{About what?}
{114}{}{关于什么？}
#{115}{}{I'm looking for work.}
{115}{}{我在找工作。}
#{116}{}{Uh, nothing. I just want to chat.}
{116}{}{呃，没什么。我只是想聊聊天。}
#{117}{}{[He waves his hand dismissively] Boss doesn't handle those little details. We have an administrator for that.}
{117}{}{[他不屑地挥挥手]老板不处理这些小细节。我们有一个管理员。}
#{118}{}{Mr. Chase said I could find *serious* work here.}
{118}{}{蔡斯先生说我可以在这里找到“严肃”的工作。}
#{119}{}{Wait here. [he knocks, steps into another room, and returns after a moment] Boss is ready for you. Be quiet and courteous. Mr. Luciano deserves respect, you get that?}
{119}{}{在这里等着。[他敲门，走进另一个房间，过了一会儿又回来]老板已经为你准备好了。保持安静和礼貌。卢西亚诺先生值得尊敬，明白吗？}
#{120}{}{Johnny Chase? That changes things. }
{120}{}{约翰尼・蔡斯？这改变了一切。}
#{121}{}{I don't handle "little details" either. I'm here for... *serious* work.}
{121}{}{我也不处理“小细节”。我来这里是为了。。。*认真工作。}
#{122}{}{Oh, is that so? [he crosses his arms and looks you up and down] You *look* serious... Maybe you're the real deal.}
{122}{}{哦，是这样吗？[他交叉双臂上下打量着你]你看起来很严肃。。。也许你才是真正的交易。}
#{123}{}{I talked to her. She said I could get some *serious* work.}
{123}{}{我和她谈过了。她说我可以找些严肃的工作。}
#{124}{}{That's all I wanted to know. Bye.}
{124}{}{我只想知道这些。再见。}
#{125}{}{Okay.}
{125}{}{可以。}
#{126}{}{Do you know you have a spy hanging around?}
{126}{}{你知道你身边有个间谍吗？}
#{127}{}{Oh yeah? Who?}
{127}{}{哦，是吗？谁？}
#{128}{}{A man outside named Canary. He responds to the code phrase "The gilding has gone from our age."}
{128}{}{外面有个叫金丝雀的人。他回应了“镀金已经从我们这个时代消失了”这句话}
#{129}{}{Uh, no one, I'm just making sure you're paying attention. Good work!}
{129}{}{呃，没人，我只是确定你注意了。干得好！}
#{130}{}{We checked it out, and you were right. Boss said to give you this. }
{130}{}{我们查过了，你是对的。老板说给你这个。}
#{131}{}{Thanks for the cash.}
{131}{}{谢谢你的现金。}
#{132}{}{That's not all. Boss wants to talk to you. Go on in.}
{132}{}{还不止这些。老板想和你谈谈。进去吧。}
#{133}{}{Great.}
{133}{}{伟大的。}

{134}{}{我有赖特先生的口信。}
#{135}{}{I almost believed that you were with us... }

#{136}{}{Boss is waiting. Go on in.}
{136}{}{老板在等。进去吧。}
#{137}{}{Great.}
{137}{}{伟大的。}
#{138}{}{It'll cost you 1000 dollars. Of course, unless you have a special deal with Mr. Luciano.}
{138}{}{你要花1000美元。当然，除非你和卢西亚诺先生有特别协议。}
#{139}{}{Hey, this is a good slave you're talking about! He works hard, knows his place, and the cattle listens to him. Slaves like this are hard to find.}
{139}{}{嘿，你说的是个好奴隶！他工作努力，知道自己的位置，牛也听他的。像这样的奴隶很难找到。}
#{140}{}{I want to purchase a specific slave: Joseph from Uranium City.}
{140}{}{我想买一个奴隶：铀城的约瑟夫。}
#{141}{}{We paid 250 dollars for this slave. Unless you have a deal with Mr. Luciano, why would we sell him?}
{141}{}{我们花了250美元买了这个奴隶。除非你和卢西亚诺先生达成协议，否则我们为什么要卖掉他？}
#{142}{}{I'll double the price.}
{142}{}{我要加倍的价钱。}
#{143}{}{Hmm. Okay. 500 dollars and he's all yours.}
{143}{}{嗯。好吧。500美元，他就是你的了。}
#{144}{}{Here, take the money.}
{144}{}{给，拿着钱。}
#{145}{}{I'll think about it.}
{145}{}{我会考虑的。}
#{146}{}{It's done. I'll radio the guards and tell them you'll be picking up your goods from the paddock.}
{146}{}{完成了。我会用无线电通知警卫，告诉他们你要去围场拿东西。}
#{147}{}{Okay.}
{147}{}{可以。}
#{148}{}{You have a slave from Uranium City. I want to buy him.}
{148}{}{你有个铀城的奴隶。我想买他。}
#{149}{}{You have a slave from the Cheyenne tribe. I want to buy him.}
{149}{}{你有一个夏延部落的奴隶。我想买他。}
#{150}{}{I'm afraid to ask, but who are you?}
{150}{}{我不敢问，但你是谁？}
#{151}{}{My name is Machete Rodriguez. Remember it. I'm Boss's personal bodyguard and head of security at the ranch.}
{151}{}{我叫弯刀罗德里格斯。记住它。我是老板的贴身保镖，也是牧场的保安主管。}
#{152}{}{You have a strange name... Machete.}
{152}{}{你有个奇怪的名字。。。弯刀。}
#{153}{}{You're not too bright, are you? It's a nickname. Guess how I got it.}
{153}{}{你不太聪明吧？是个外号。猜猜我是怎么得到的。}
#{154}{}{It's a nickname. Want to know how I got it?}
{154}{}{是个外号。想知道我是怎么得到的吗？}
#{155}{}{Well, nice to meet you... }
{155}{}{很高兴见到你。。。}
#{156}{}{Well, you don't have a machete, so... }
{156}{}{你没有弯刀，所以。。。}
#{157}{}{Hmm... Name, too?}
{157}{}{隐马尔可夫模型。。。名字也是？}
#{158}{}{No. My parents called me that. They came to Reno after the bombs.}
{158}{}{不，我父母这么叫我。炸弹爆炸后他们来到雷诺。}
#{159}{}{Never mind.}
{159}{}{不要介意。}
#{160}{}{Where did they live before that?}
{160}{}{在那之前他们住在哪里？}
#{161}{}{Mexico. It's far to the south. They say everyone was starving there, so everyone went north. Everyone who could.}
{161}{}{墨西哥。它在遥远的南方。他们说那里每个人都在挨饿，所以每个人都去了北方。所有可能的人。}
#{162}{}{Back to your name. I still don't understand... }
{162}{}{回到你的名字。我还是不明白。。。}
#{163}{}{[He scowls] Not anymore. I lost her fighting the dogs at the railway station south of Reno. I looked everywhere, but I couldn't find her! She was the best weapon I ever owned!}
{163}{}{[他愁眉不展]再也没有了。我在雷诺以南的火车站与狗搏斗时失去了她。我到处找，但找不到她！她是我拥有的最好的武器！}
#{164}{}{Maybe I can help with search?}
{164}{}{也许我能帮你查一下？}
#{165}{}{I'm guessing you have a weapon to go with your name?}
{165}{}{我猜你有武器可以配上你的名字？}
#{166}{}{Hey, you find her, you'll be my new best friend! I'll pay to have her back in my hands. But after that storm blew through a while back, she's gotta be under the sand by now.}
{166}{}{嘿，你找到她，你会成为我最好的新朋友！我会付钱让她回到我手里。但在那场风暴过去一段时间后，她现在肯定在沙子下面了。}
#{167}{}{I'll bring your machete back to you. Wait here.}
{167}{}{我会把你的弯刀还给你。在这里等着。}
#{168}{}{I found your machete! It's pretty rusty, but it still seems fit for use.}
{168}{}{我找到你的弯刀了！它已经生锈了，但似乎还适合使用。}
#{169}{}{I found your machete! I even refinished it for you.}
{169}{}{我找到你的弯刀了！我甚至还帮你修了。}
#{170}{}{You found her! I can't believe it! I promised to pay, and I always keep my word. Thank you.}
{170}{}{你找到她了！真不敢相信！我答应付钱，而且我一直信守诺言。非常感谢。}
#{171}{}{It wasn17t hard.}
{171}{}{这并不难。}
#{172}{}{Yeah? She doesn't give out many recommendations. }
{172}{}{是 啊？她没有给出多少建议。}
#{180}{}{What is this place?}
{180}{}{这是什么地方？}
#{181}{}{[He narrows his eyes suspiciously] This is ranch of Oliver Luciano, the greatest businessman in Reno. You should show respect. This is the office. The ranch is behind the building.}
{181}{}{[他怀疑地眯起眼睛]这是里诺最伟大的商人奥利弗・卢西亚诺的牧场。你应该表现出尊重。这是办公室。农场在大楼后面。}
#{182}{}{Is one ranch really such a big deal?}
{182}{}{一个牧场真的很重要吗？}
#{183}{}{Fifty slaves, two dozen guards, tons of living brahmin meat - yeah, it's huge.}
{183}{}{五十个奴隶，二十个守卫，成吨的活生生的婆罗门肉-是的，它很大。}
#{184}{}{Slaves?}
{184}{}{奴隶？}
#{185}{}{You mentioned brahmin meat. Can I get some?}
{185}{}{你提到婆罗门肉。我能买一些吗？}
#{186}{}{Sounds impressive. Can I take a look?}
{186}{}{听起来不错。我能看看吗？}
#{187}{}{}
{187}{}{}
#{188}{}{Don't you think it's wrong to imprison people and force them to work?}
{188}{}{你不觉得把人关起来强迫他们工作是不对的吗？}
#{189}{}{}
{189}{}{}
#{190}{}{Did I stutter? Yes, slaves.}
{190}{}{我口吃了吗？是的，奴隶。}
#{191}{}{I don't handle that. Talk to the administrator. Her office is the building to the west out back.}
{191}{}{我没办法。和管理员谈谈。她的办公室在后面西边的那栋楼里。}
#{192}{}{No. [he crosses his arms] Only workers and friends of Mr. Luciano get to walk around the ranch.}
{192}{}{没有[他交叉双臂]只有卢西亚诺先生的工人和朋友才能在牧场里走动。}
#{193}{}{}
{193}{}{}
#{194}{}{[He raises an eyebrow in surprise, then throws his head back and laughs] You're funny! These slaves aren't people like you and me. They're *lucky* Boss gives them food and safety for their work! He took them from slums and villages where they couldn't control their own lives anyway. To them, Boss is a *god*! And why not? If not for him, they'd already be dead.}
{194}{}{[他惊讶地扬起眉毛，然后把头往后仰笑]你真有趣！这些奴隶不是像你我这样的人。他们很幸运，老板给了他们食物和工作安全！他把他们带离贫民窟和村庄，在那里他们无论如何也无法控制自己的生活。对他们来说，老板就是上帝！为什么不呢？如果不是他，他们早就死了。}
#{195}{}{So they're not abused here?}
{195}{}{所以他们在这里没有被虐待？}
#{196}{}{[He gives you a funny look] Were you raised in a vault, or something? I told you, they're not fit to run their own lives, so we have to show them who's boss or they might get *stupid* ideas. Sometimes we need to remind them.}
{196}{}{[他滑稽地看了你一眼]你是在金库里长大的还是什么？我告诉过你，他们不适合管理自己的生活，所以我们必须让他们知道谁是老板，否则他们可能会有愚蠢的想法。有时我们需要提醒他们。}
#{197}{}{Can I ask you again about the ranch?}
{197}{}{我能再问你一次牧场的事吗？}
#{200}{}{Do you need any more slave collars?}
{200}{}{你还需要奴隶项圈吗？}
#{201}{}{You have collars? That's good! We always need more. I'll pay 100 dollars for every one you bring me.}
{201}{}{你有项圈吗？太好了！我们总是需要更多。你每给我带一个我就付100美元。}
#{202}{}{Then I have collars for sale.}
{202}{}{我还有项圈要卖。}
#{203}{}{I think I'll hold on to my collars for now.}
{203}{}{我想我现在还是抓紧衣领吧。}
#{204}{}{How many you have?}
{204}{}{你有多少？}
#{205}{}{[One collar]}
{205}{}{[一个衣领]}
#{206}{}{[Two collars]}
{206}{}{[两个项圈]}
#{207}{}{[Three collars]}
{207}{}{[三个项圈]}
#{208}{}{[Five collars]}
{208}{}{[五环]}
#{209}{}{[Everything: }
{209}{}{[所有内容：}
#{210}{}{]}
{210}{}{]}
#{211}{}{[He takes the collars and gives you $100 for each] Good deal. If you find any more, I'll pay.}
{211}{}{[他拿着项圈，给你100美元一个]很划算。如果你找到更多的，我会付钱的。}
#{212}{}{Good.}
{212}{}{很好。}
#{220}{}{Mr. Luciano said I should discuss the casino job with you.}
{220}{}{卢西亚诺先生说我应该和你讨论赌场的工作。}
#{221}{}{[He looks around, then leans in, speaking quietly] Boss chose you? I was hoping for some more... Rough. I've been planning this a long time, I want someone who knows the business.}
{221}{}{[他环顾四周，然后俯身，安静地说]老板选了你？我希望能有更多。。。粗糙的。我已经计划了很长时间了，我想要一个了解这项业务的人。}
#{222}{}{Whether you trust me or not, Mr. Luciano chose me, so let's get started.}
{222}{}{不管你信不信，卢西亚诺先生选择了我，我们开始吧。}
#{223}{}{Okay, we've got two choices of diversions. Do both if you can. First, slip the El Dorado visitors some poisoned beer, so they'll be unhappy with the casino. That'll get Ricardo's attention. Where you get the poison is up to you.}
{223}{}{好吧，我们有两个选择。如果可以的话，两个都做。首先，给埃尔多拉多的游客们倒点毒啤酒，这样他们就会对赌场不满意。那会引起里卡多的注意。毒药从哪里来取决于你自己。}
#{224}{}{What's the second choice?}
{224}{}{第二个选择是什么？}
#{225}{}{You saw the El Dorado security uses Tommy guns, right? Bertolini bought every one he could find ten years ago. Whenever someone sees a Tommy gun, they think El Dorado.}
{225}{}{你见过埃尔多拉多的保安用汤米枪，对吧？贝托里尼十年前买了他能找到的每一件。每当有人看到汤米枪，他们就会想到埃尔多拉多。}
#{226}{}{I understand. Keep going.}
{226}{}{我理解。继续前进。}
#{227}{}{You have to get your hands on a Tommy gun and attack some civilians. You don't have to kill anyone, just make sure everyone knows it was an attack. Hit someone like a hooker or a slum dweller. People will think the El Dorado workers are roughing people up. Ricardo will *have* to investigate.}
{227}{}{你得拿着汤米枪袭击一些平民。你不必杀任何人，只要确保每个人都知道这是一起袭击。打妓女或贫民窟居民之类的人。人们会认为埃尔多拉多的工人在虐待人们。里卡多必须调查。}
#{228}{}{Gee, that's all? You don't have any other pointless complications to throw in there? Alright, I'd better get to work. Have fun sitting on your ass doing nothing.}
{228}{}{天哪，就这些？你没有其他毫无意义的麻烦事要说吗？好吧，我得去工作了。坐在你的屁股上什么都不做很开心。}
#{229}{}{I've got it. Time to get down to business.}
{229}{}{我知道了。是时候开始谈正事了。}
#{230}{}{I need to discuss the casino job.}
{230}{}{我要谈谈赌场的工作。}
#{231}{}{What, more questions?}
{231}{}{什么，还有问题吗？}
#{232}{}{Explain the plan again.}
{232}{}{再解释一下计划。}
#{233}{}{Forget it, I'll figure it out myself.}
{233}{}{算了吧，我自己想办法。}
#{234}{}{You want people to see me shooting civilians with a Tommy gun, but if they see my face, won't they know I'm not working for the casino? They might even trace it back to you.}
{234}{}{你想让人们看到我用汤米枪射杀平民，但如果他们看到我的脸，难道他们不知道我不是在赌场工作吗？他们甚至会追查到你。}
#{235}{}{Hmm, good point. Okay, I got this. [he hands you a balaclava] You can hide your face. Just make sure you're not wearing anything people will recognize.}
{235}{}{嗯，说得好。好的，我知道了。[他递给你一个巴拉克拉瓦]你可以把脸藏起来。确保你没穿别人能认出的衣服。}
#{236}{}{Fine.}
{236}{}{好的。}
#{237}{}{Do you know anyone who can help with safe-cracking?}
{237}{}{你知道谁能帮你安全破解吗？}
#{238}{}{I know a guy downtown called Basketball Buddy. He used to pick locks, until he got the stuffing beat out of him, heh heh. But he probably won't help with Bertolini's safe. You need someone with real skills, and there's not many people like that in the city.}
{238}{}{我认识一个叫Basketball Buddy的人。他以前总是挑锁，直到把馅料打出来，呵呵。但他可能不会帮伯托里尼的安全。你需要一个有真正技能的人，而在这个城市里这样的人并不多。}
#{239}{}{Thanks.}
{239}{}{谢谢。}
#{240}{}{Mr. Luciano wants me to discuss the job with you.}
{240}{}{卢西亚诺先生想让我和你讨论这份工作。}
#{241}{}{Let's discuss Mr. Luciano's job again.}
{241}{}{让我们再讨论一下卢西亚诺先生的工作。}
#{242}{}{You need my help, don't you? Just admit it. And yes, I have a plan.}
{242}{}{你需要我的帮助，是吗？承认吧。是的，我有个计划。}
#{243}{}{Tell me. I really need your... Help.}
{243}{}{告诉我。我真的需要你的。。。救命啊。}
#{244}{}{I'll figure it out myself. I don't want you getting a big head.}
{244}{}{我自己想办法。我不想你有个大脑袋。}
#{245}{}{[He becomes serious] We already talked about this. I can't help with a short memory.}
{245}{}{我们已经谈过了。我的记忆力很差。}
#{246}{}{[He becomes serious] Hmm. You got the last job done. Okay, maybe you can handle this.}
{246}{}{[他变得严肃起来]嗯。你完成了最后一项工作。好吧，也许你能搞定。}
#{247}{}{[Next]}
{247}{}{[下一步]}
#{248}{}{We need to get Thompson and Stryker angry enough to start a war between them.}
{248}{}{我们要让汤普森和史崔克愤怒到足以发动战争。}
#{249}{}{You want the best way, wire explosives to the front door of both headquarters. That'll make some noise. If you can't do that, kill someone at each headquarters without them knowing it was you. They'll blame each other and it'll give us more time.}
{249}{}{如果你想找到最好的办法，就把炸药装到两个总部的前门。那会发出一些噪音。如果你做不到，在每个总部杀了一个人，而他们不知道是你。他们会互相指责，这会给我们更多的时间。}
#{250}{}{What if they recognize me?}
{250}{}{如果他们认出我怎么办？}
#{251}{}{Where can I get incendiary grenades?}
{251}{}{我在哪能买到燃烧手榴弹？}
#{252}{}{Where can I get explosives?}
{252}{}{我在哪能买到炸药？}
#{253}{}{That's enough. I will take it from here.}
{253}{}{够了。我要从这里开始。}
#{254}{}{Finally, I'm getting some use out of you. Now I'm off to do all the work. Again.}
{254}{}{最后，我要利用你了。现在我要去做所有的工作了。再一次。}
#{255}{}{Hey, I didn't give you that facemask for party tricks, you know. Use your head, rookie!}
{255}{}{嘿，我给你的面具可不是用来搞派对的，你知道的。动动脑筋，菜鸟！}
#{256}{}{If you can't do it yourself, find someone who will do it. That's your problem, not mine.}
{256}{}{如果你自己做不到，找个愿意做的人。那是你的问题，不是我的。}
#{257}{}{That's your problem, not mine. Start with the mechanic at the station.}
{257}{}{那是你的问题，不是我的。从车站的机修工开始。}
#{258}{}{Take this. [he hands you a balaclava] Put it on before you do the job, and they won't see your face.}
{258}{}{拿着这个。[他递给你一个巴拉克拉瓦]在你工作之前戴上它，他们就看不到你的脸了。}
#{260}{}{Mr. Luciano wants me to take care of some deals. He said I should talk to you.}
{260}{}{卢西亚诺先生要我处理一些交易。他说我应该和你谈谈。}
#{261}{}{You? Huh, Boss must see something in you. Okay, but remember, this is *delicate*.}
{261}{}{你呢？嗯，老板一定看到你的一些东西了。好吧，但请记住，这很微妙。}
#{262}{}{How delicate?}
{262}{}{有多精致？}
#{263}{}{Ugh, don't tell me I have to wear a tie!}
{263}{}{啊，别告诉我我得打领带！}
#{264}{}{Thanks to the bugs you put in Bertolini's room, we learned about a secret deal outside of Reno. Ricardo wants to get weapons. Right now, he just wants to protect himself during the fighting, but he'll come for us sooner or later.}
{264}{}{多亏你在贝托里尼的房间里放了窃听器，我们才知道里诺城外有个秘密交易。里卡多想要武器。现在，他只是想在战斗中保护自己，但他迟早会来找我们的。}
#{265}{}{So that's what he had that money full of suitcase for... }
{265}{}{所以这就是他拿着满满一箱钱的原因。。。}
#{266}{}{Yeah, and that's what we'll use it for. You'll pretend to be from the casino and complete the deal. Boss wants to keep friendly the caravan for the future... If we can. But the most important thing is to get the weapons. The better you do, the better *everyone* will do, you get it?}
{266}{}{是的，这就是我们要用的。你就假装是赌场的人完成交易。老板想在未来和车队保持友好关系。。。如果可以的话。但最重要的是拿到武器。你做得越好，每个人都会做得越好，明白吗？}
#{267}{}{Got it.}
{267}{}{知道了。}
#{268}{}{Trust me, anything you "get", I'll get.}
{268}{}{相信我，你“得到”的任何东西，我都会得到。}
#{269}{}{Deal's taking place at night outside Reno. When you're ready, talk to me.}
{269}{}{交易在里诺外面的晚上进行。准备好了就跟我说。}
#{270}{}{I'm ready now.}
{270}{}{我准备好了。}
#{271}{}{Well, I'll come back when I'm ready.}
{271}{}{好吧，我准备好了就回来。}
#{272}{}{Well, how are the weapons?}
{272}{}{武器怎么样了？}
#{273}{}{There's less than we thought there'd be. Bertolini must be a lousy barterer, heh-heh! Anyway, we got enough weapons to fight off an attack. Boss is happy. He doesn't act like it... Ever... But I can tell.}
{273}{}{比我们想象的要少。贝托里尼一定是个差劲的易货者，嘿嘿！不管怎样，我们有足够的武器来击退攻击。老板很高兴。他不像那样。。。永远。。。但我能看出来。}
#{274}{}{That's a lot of weapons for one ranch, isn't it?}
{274}{}{对于一个牧场来说，那是很多武器，不是吗？}
#{275}{}{Boss doesn't want to rely on anyone. These weapons are just one part of that. Anyway, it's not just for the ranch, but convoys too. We have a lot of things to protect, not just here.}
{275}{}{老板不想依赖任何人。这些武器只是其中的一部分。不管怎样，这不仅仅是为了牧场，还有车队。我们有很多东西要保护，不仅仅是在这里。}
#{276}{}{I see. Well, I'll be going.}
{276}{}{我懂了。好吧，我要走了。}
#{1113}{}{Nothing, actually, I'm here for something else.}
{1113}{}{没什么，事实上，我是来找别的事的。}
#{1118}{}{Mr. Chase said I could find *serious* work here.}
{1118}{}{蔡斯先生说我可以在这里找到“严肃”的工作。}
#{1130}{}{We checked it out, and you were right. Boss said to give you this. }
{1130}{}{我们查过了，你是对的。老板说给你这个。}
#{1153}{}{You're not too bright, huh? It's a nickname. Guess how I got it.}
{1153}{}{你不太聪明吧？是个外号。猜猜我是怎么得到的。}
#{1181}{}{[He narrows his eyes suspiciously] This is ranch of Oliver Luciano, the greatest businessman in Reno. You should show respect. This is the office. The ranch is behind the building.}
{1181}{}{[他怀疑地眯起眼睛]这是里诺最伟大的商人奥利弗・卢西亚诺的牧场。你应该表现出尊重。这是办公室。农场在大楼后面。}
