### {103}{}{Nothing. Just passing by.}
{103}{}{没有什么只是路过。}
### {104}{}{About this place? Actually, I don?t know much. You see, all I know is that this was a military base and for some strange reason it was abandoned. I think it had something to do with the research they carried out in there.}

### {106}{}{Alright. Thanks for the info.}
{106}{}{好吧谢谢你提供的信息。}
### {107}{}{A secret one... including a genetic virus or something. There's a research lab below ground level, which was sealed after the accident. The virus spread through the air all over the base and there were some casualties, but we couldn't find a [...smiles...] volunteer to investigate. The truth is, we don't have appropriate suits for that kind of contaminated environment. And personally, I wouldn't risk my ass only to find out there's nothing worth going down for. I strongly recommend you stay away. If that shit spreads outside... then God help us all.}
{107}{}{一个秘密。。。包括遗传病毒之类的。地下有一个研究实验室，事故发生后被封闭了。病毒在整个基地的空气中传播，有一些人员伤亡，但我们找不到[…微笑…]志愿者进行调查。事实是，我们没有适合这种受污染环境的衣服。就我个人而言，我不会冒险去发现没有什么值得去做的。我强烈建议你远离。如果那东西扩散到外面。。。那么上帝保佑我们所有人。}

{110}{}{你比看上去还笨！我不能让一些聪明的家伙在我们下面几米的地方捅那些致命的大便。每个人。。。是时候教这个爱管闲事的帕克一些免费的射击课了！}
### {111}{}{You first, shithead!}
{111}{}{你先来，混蛋！}
### {112}{}{Because of the situation we've got here, we are keeping this base protected from anyone stupid enough to release that virus which by the way can't and will not reach the surface, not on my watch.}
{112}{}{由于我们现在的情况，我们正在保护这个基地免受任何愚蠢到可以释放病毒的人的伤害，顺便说一句，病毒不能也不会浮出水面，在我的监督下。}

### {120}{}{What the...?! You dumb fuck. You're not going anywhere... Guards!!}
{120}{}{什么。。。？！你这个蠢蛋。你哪儿也不去。。。卫兵！！}
### {121}{}{Oops... did I just say I was going to release that virus?}
{121}{}{哎呀。。。我刚才说我要释放病毒吗？}
### {122}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
