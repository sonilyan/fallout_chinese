{1017}{}{we'll settle, where we'll start building our new}
{1018}{}{empire, the New Radius. Anyone who stands in}
{1019}{}{our way will be wiped out, crushed, destroyed}
{1020}{}{like these pussies who tried not to let us in}

{1027}{}{It's not so bad here, actually. The vagrants}

{1038}{}{Holy Wasteland! We were seriously battered by}

{1040}{}{went to Hell tonight! Fucking bastards came in}
{1041}{}{door, but were so brainless that they didn't even}
{1042}{}{through the front bother to call for backup!}
{1043}{}{Naive, arrogant assholes! Maybe their armor gives}
{1044}{}{them a good protection from radiation and shit,}
{1045}{}{but they didn't stand any chance against two}
{1046}{}{miniguns! Too bad the suits are torn to bits, I}
{1047}{}{could use one. Still, the engines of the three}
{1048}{}{"Predators" turned out to be intact. Smartie will}
{1049}{}{attach them to the machinery, and we will be able}
{1050}{}{to mostly replenish our arsenal. Next time we'll}

{1061}{}{his arms off, ripped his belly open and feed guts}
{1062}{}{to the dogs. 6 Jackals killed, one captured, and}
{1063}{}{one escaped, that rat... So, the thing is that}
{1064}{}{there's a fortified facility in the south part of}
{1065}{}{Radius, the New World Order or something. They}
{1066}{}{make some kind of canned food out of mutants.}
{1067}{}{It's not much of a delicacy, but still edible...}
{1068}{}{And a lot safer than hunting Ursa. Their guards}
{1069}{}{suck ass, they don't have a lot of guns, and we}
{1070}{}{could just kill them one by one on the street.}
{1071}{}{But if they decide to barricade inside the}
{1072}{}{factory... We need to find the way to lure them}
{1073}{}{out. In the meantime, let's trade our most rusty}

{2000}{}{Researching the anti-radiation painkiller drug.}
{2001}{}{}
{2002}{}{September 30, 2183}
{2003}{}{Although radiation is visibly dropping in the most}
{2004}{}{known areas of Radius, and Seekers don't die}
{2005}{}{as quickly, there is a demand for developing a}
{2006}{}{new drug to help them on long-range missions.}
{2007}{}{The most sensible thing to do would be to try}
{2008}{}{to synthesize something with the properties of}
{2009}{}{a painkiller, a stimulant and a radiation-removing}
{2010}{}{agent. Obviously, the experiments should begin}
{2011}{}{with an in-depth study of the properties of the}
{2012}{}{pre-war "RadOut" drug. Fortunately, quite a few}
{2013}{}{documents on Rainbow Pharmaceuticals are still}
{2014}{}{readable. Well, let's get started.}
{2015}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2016}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2017}{}{December 26, 2183}
{2018}{}{For many days and nights now, I'm unsuccessfully}
{2019}{}{trying to find out the base "RadOut" component.}
{2020}{}{The formula described in the factory documents}
{2021}{}{is purely synthetic, it doesn't tell me anything.}
{2022}{}{So, the only available option left is to study}
{2023}{}{the wildlife that developed resistance to the}
{2024}{}{radiation. Let's start with the scorpions.}
{2025}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2026}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2027}{}{May 12, 2184}
{2028}{}{Yes! There's no doubt that the secretions of ant}
{2029}{}{lions have a powerful rad-extracting properties.}
{2030}{}{After a special pressurized treatment, of course.}
{2031}{}{A shame I had so much time wasted on studying}
{2032}{}{scorpions, but that's beside the point.}
{2033}{}{Now, let's begin our experiments!}
{2034}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2035}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2036}{}{July 13, 2184}
{2037}{}{The test subjects are reacting extremely poorly}
{2038}{}{to the effects of the "Drop". That's the name I}
{2039}{}{gave the drug. They show all the signs of severe}
{2040}{}{intoxication, and there have already been two}
{2041}{}{lethal cases... No one wants to try my medication}
{2042}{}{willingly. There's a chance I'll have to resort to}
{2043}{}{self-testing... But this is for later. For now,}
{2044}{}{I need to find an antidote to formic acid...}
{2045}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2046}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2047}{}{December 01, 2184}
{2048}{}{That's it! I found it! Scorpion venom perfectly}
{2049}{}{neutralizes formic acid! I should proceed to the}
{2050}{}{experiments, fast! Hmm... Actually, one of our}
{2051}{}{recently returned Seekers shows severe signs}
{2052}{}{of anemia. How convenient.}
{2053}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2054}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2055}{}{January 05, 2185}
{2056}{}{Everything is going great. Ben is recovering,}
{2057}{}{he feels better every minute, taking one "Drop"}
{2058}{}{a day. He seems a little more irritable, but the}
{2059}{}{improvement of his health condition is evident!}
{2060}{}{Time to start the production!}
{2061}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2062}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2063}{}{January 07, 2185}
{2064}{}{Something's wrong... The dramatic improvement of}
{2065}{}{Ben's well-being was followed by an even sharper}
{2066}{}{decline in his... uh... mental stability. He's acting}
{2067}{}{like an animal, wheezing, snapping, and this morning}
{2068}{}{he tried to chew his own arm off...}
{2069}{}{Maybe it's because of his body properties - he's a}
{2070}{}{ghoul after all. Or maybe he took too big of a}
{2071}{}{dose. Now I'm sure that no one's would want to}
{2072}{}{volunteer on testing the drug. I have to adjust}
{2073}{}{the ratio of ingredients in the compound, and}
{2074}{}{prepare for testing the chemical on myself...}
{2075}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2076}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2077}{}{January 12, 2185}
{2078}{}{No one liked him anyway. And why bury a dead guy}
{2079}{}{into the ground when you can feed him to our ant}
{2080}{}{lions? I need them alive for experiments...}
{2081}{}{There are only three of them left, so I made a}
{2082}{}{decision not to change the drug's composition.}
{2083}{}{I have a theory that Ben died because of some}
{2084}{}{peculiarities of his ghoul body. As soon as the}
{2085}{}{ants are done with him and gain some weight,}
{2086}{}{I'll make more "Drop". Going to try it out.}
{2087}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2088}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2089}{}{January 15, 2185}
{2090}{}{Oooh... Mmmm... Hehehey! Yeahhhhhh...}
{2091}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2092}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2093}{}{January 16, 2185}
{2094}{}{That... was... wonderful... I think I've seen the}
{2095}{}{gods of the wasteland... I know, I know it sounds}
{2096}{}{crazy, but it was so... real! The "Drop" took my}
{2097}{}{mind to some other world, a perfect world...}
{2098}{}{I need to make... more...}
{2099}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2100}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2101}{}{January 26, 2185}
{2102}{}{It's a monstrous drug. I can say it, but I can't}
{2103}{}{make myself realize it... The "Drop" has many}
{2104}{}{powerful effects, but the strongest one is,}
{2105}{}{without any doubt, the worst kind of addiction.}
{2106}{}{I have no ant lions left, so I need to send our}
{2107}{}{Seekers to get some. I think I'll give them a}
{2108}{}{sample of my drug, so they wouldn't ask too}
{2109}{}{many questions...}
{2110}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2111}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2112}{}{January 30, 2185}
{2113}{}{My body is twisting immensely! God!!! The bastard}
{2114}{}{ripped out my freshly-made supply and devoured it}
{2115}{}{in an instant! Serves him right... His human body}
{2116}{}{surrendered almost immediately - he literally spat}
{2117}{}{out his bloody guts. I think the drug has this}
{2118}{}{severe effect because... It's because I made the}
{2119}{}{"Drop" out of the ants that ate Ben... And I got}
{2120}{}{five more ants... Hungry fucking ants...}
{2121}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2122}{}{**END-PAR**}
{2123}{}{February 03, 2185}
{2124}{}{Phew... Well, it wasn't that hard. I just had to}
{2125}{}{pretend that the ghoul wanted to eat my newborn}
{2126}{}{baby girl. I'm a scientist, after all, and he's a}
{2127}{}{ghoul. Nobody believes ghouls. But my... my hunch}
{2128}{}{was confirmed completely: eating the ghoul's flesh}
{2129}{}{makes the ant lions produce another, different}
{2130}{}{kind of formic acid! And that acid is... It is...}
{2131}{}{It is the new, delightful world of the "Drop"!}

{9003}{}{It is a fifth week of my journey to get to the}
{9004}{}{Olympus... There were four of us when we learned}
{9005}{}{of the tower from one Ghoul. God, what a blessing}
{9006}{}{it was - to know that somewhere in the world}
{9007}{}{exist a place without all the dangers, terrible}
{9008}{}{beasts... And even more terrible men! We walked}
{9009}{}{for days, moving to the west, toward the center}
{9010}{}{of the valley... Then we were ambushed by a}
{9011}{}{Chimera. It was hell! The monster ripped Bob in}
{9012}{}{half in a matter of seconds and then jumped to}

{9015}{}{Those horrible sounds are still ringing in my}
{9016}{}{head. We continued to walk - me and my dad, just}
{9017}{}{the two of us. We no longer made bonfires at night.}
{9018}{}{One afternoon, when everything around seemed}
{9019}{}{very peaceful, my dad suddenly fell knee-deep in}
{9020}{}{the sand. I jumped away, tried to find some kind}
{9021}{}{of a stick to pull him out - but with no avail.}
{9022}{}{Then he started screaming... Screaming so loud...}
{9023}{}{And then the ants came... A dozen of them... Oh,}

{11002}{}{I don't know why it took an interest in you,}
{11003}{}{but I'd be careful. It's never helped anyone}
{11004}{}{before.}
{11005}{}{}
{11006}{}{Stupid!}
{11007}{}{}
{11008}{}{A blast of lightning fired past me, shattering an}
{11009}{}{old clock at the back of the overview office I}
{11010}{}{was cowering in. The Wasteland Survival}
{11011}{}{Guide was full of all sorts of helpful}
{11012}{}{tips. Scavenging guides. A whole chapter on}
{11013}{}{mines. And more! And then there were the}
{11014}{}{not-so-helpful ones. After having read the}
{11015}{}{chapter on "Making Pre-War Earth Pony}
{11016}{}{Technology Work For You", my first thought}
{11017}{}{when I came across the ruins of Ironshod}
{11018}{}{Firearms was to take a peek inside and see if}
{11019}{}{there was any technology I could make work}
{11020}{}{for me.}
{11021}{}{}
{11022}{}{Instead, I got myself trapped in a maze full of}
{11023}{}{ponicidal robots and automated turrets, fleeing}
{11024}{}{until I managed to back myself into a corner}
{11025}{}{here in an office box high above the factory}
{11026}{}{floor. Almost out of ammo. If I hadn't found}
{11027}{}{that medical box in the employee bathroom, I}
{11028}{}{would have died trying to get across the second}
{11029}{}{floor.}
{11030}{}{}
{11031}{}{How could I possibly have been so very stupid?}
{11032}{}{}
{11033}{}{Below, three of those robots were rolling about,}
{11034}{}{looking for me. They were tracked things, built}
{11035}{}{to somewhat resemble ponies, with clear}
{11036}{}{domed heads that housed real brains. I refused}
{11037}{}{to think that the ponies who built them might}
{11038}{}{have used other ponies' brains in the}
{11039}{}{construction. The thought was just too}
{11040}{}{horrible. Even doing that to an animal's brain}
{11041}{}{was awful. And clearly, two-hundred years of}
{11042}{}{continuous operation had done nothing for their}
{11043}{}{sanity.}
{11044}{}{}
{11045}{}{Come on! We only want to kill you for trespassing!}
{11046}{}{}
{11047}{}{Case in point.}
{11048}{}{}
{11049}{}{The fact that the voice sounded like a young}
{11050}{}{filly, despite being clearly artificial, just made}
{11051}{}{them that much freakier. Fortunately, the railing}
{11052}{}{on the catwalks leading up to this office were}
{11053}{}{too narrow for the brain-bots to get up here.}
{11054}{}{}
{11055}{}{A much deeper, authoritative voice boomed}
{11056}{}{across the room. "Surrender in the name of the}
{11057}{}{Ministry of Technology, zebra scum!"}
{11058}{}{}
{11059}{}{I cringed behind a line of metal filing cabinets}
{11060}{}{as the room filled with a rush of flame!}
{11061}{}{}
{11062}{}{Unfortunately, the same could not be said for}
{11063}{}{}
{11064}{}{the other type of guard robot I'd crossed paths}
{11065}{}{with in here. The multi-limbed things looked}
{11066}{}{like giant metal spiders, many of its arms}
{11067}{}{seemed to end in weapons, including a}
{11068}{}{buzzsaw and a flamethrower. And worse, the}
{11069}{}{damn things could fly!}
{11070}{}{}
{11071}{}{I slipped both of my grenades out of my}
{11072}{}{saddlebags and waited until the flames died}
{11073}{}{away. The metal cabinets were beginning to}
{11074}{}{get unpleasantly warm against my back, and}
{11075}{}{the heat in the air seared my lungs. The}
{11076}{}{second the flamethrower cut off, I turned my}
{11077}{}{head around the corner and levitated them both}
{11078}{}{right up to the metal monster, pulling out the}
{11079}{}{stems on the way. The moment it saw me, the}
{11080}{}{robot raised a pulsing green weapon that}
{11081}{}{looked like a unicorn's horn. Eldritch fire}
{11082}{}{erupted from it, shooting past me close enough}
{11083}{}{to singe my cheek. The blast struck an old fan}
{11084}{}{sitting on the desk behind me; it glowed green}
{11085}{}{for a moment, then melted! I ducked back as I}
{11086}{}{dropped the grenades.}
{11087}{}{}
{11088}{}{The explosion rocked the office. I heard a}
{11089}{}{fearsome twang as part of the catwalk outside}
{11090}{}{gave. Looking back, the robot was in a non-}
{11091}{}{functional heap. The walkway outside was still}
{11092}{}{mostly intact, but sagging badly. I wasn't sure it}
{11093}{}{could hold my weight.}
{11094}{}{}
{11095}{}{Stripping what I could from the fallen spider-bot,}
{11096}{}{I considered my options. I couldn't stay up here}
{11097}{}{}
{11098}{}{forever. If I moved very fast, I could run the}
{11099}{}{walkway without the brain-bots below getting}
{11100}{}{me. Their weaponry did not seem very}
{11101}{}{accurate. But the first few yards of the catwalk}
{11102}{}{}
{11103}{}{had partially torn free, and sagged}
{11104}{}{alarmingly. The more I looked at it, the less I}
{11105}{}{wanted to put a hoof...}

{13007}{}{July 12, 2012}
{13008}{}{Okay, let's start. This observation report}
{13009}{}{is recorded by the project "Gamma" chief}
{13010}{}{biologist, Thomas Stediak. The input data:}
{13011}{}{a child specimen of the "Chimera" project,}
{13012}{}{male, of course. We call him "Lucy" in...}
{13013}{}{hmm... hopes of a successful outcome of}
{13014}{}{the research. As we know, the Chimera}
{13015}{}{specimens are a breakthrough success for}
{13016}{}{the NCASTR bioligists, and, at the same time,}
{13017}{}{proof of how weak and incapable we are in}
{13018}{}{comparison to the creator. Every attempt}
{13019}{}{to create a female Chimera and ensure a}
{13020}{}{natural reproduction cycle has failed}
{13021}{}{by now.}
{13022}{}{}
{13023}{}{We, the staff of Biolab #2, have taken upon}
{13024}{}{ourselves the sacred duty to bring the project}
{13025}{}{to success, and find a way to make the}
{13026}{}{Chimera species capable of reproduction, with}
{13027}{}{an additional goal of freeing up the company's}
{13028}{}{hatchery facilities. Unfortunately, as always,}
{13029}{}{the "Gamma" project is limited in funding, so}
{13030}{}{only the following phases are planned:}
{13031}{}{}
{13032}{}{I - injections of gray gorilla hormone}
{13033}{}{extract}
{13034}{}{II - prolonged exposure to gamma radiation}
{13035}{}{III - physical impact, to the point of the}
{13036}{}{extreme reduction of vital signs}
{13037}{}{The rest will be done in accordance to the}
{13038}{}{available funding.}
{13039}{}{}
{13040}{}{Preparations for the phase I are ready. We}
{13041}{}{shall begin immediately.}

{13047}{}{He has been sleeping since yesterday.}

{13060}{}{show signs of emotional distress: he growls at}
{13061}{}{our scientists, does not allow anyone to enter}
{13062}{}{his cage, bites the bars of his cage. This}
{13063}{}{is a clear sign of hormonal changes taking place,}
