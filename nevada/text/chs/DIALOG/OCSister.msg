#{115}{}{How can we free your brother?}
{115}{}{我们怎样才能解救你弟弟？}
#{116}{}{I'm going to need more than a "thank you" for my help.}
{116}{}{对于我的帮助，我需要的不仅仅是一句“谢谢”。}

#{122}{}{How do you feel about moving away from here?}
{122}{}{你觉得离开这里怎么样？}
#{150}{}{What *can* we do? We can't leave. There's nothing but desert, dust and death out here. We have to stay here until we find someplace better.}
{150}{}{我们能做什么？我们不能离开。这里除了沙漠，灰尘和死亡什么都没有。我们必须呆在这里直到找到更好的地方。}
#{151}{}{We lived in Reno. It wasn't always so bad, but by the time we left people were dying every day. We heard about Gerlach from some caravaneer and thought, why not?}
{151}{}{我们住在里诺。情况并不总是那么糟糕，但我们离开的时候，每天都有人在死去。我们从一个商队老板那里听说了杰拉克，然后想，为什么不呢？}
#{152}{}{About a week on foot. [she points south] But it's a bad place to be nowadays. People like you should stay away from there.}

{153}{}{史蒂夫看着水泵坏了，大家都发疯了！这是我们唯一的水源，但他们还是不应该杀他！}
#{154}{}{That meathead from Reno is keeping him in his basement. Gerlach won't touch Steve as long as you have a deal with him, or if we've got water left in the tank. Our only hope is for you to fix the pump... You won't leave us like this, will you?}
{154}{}{雷诺的那个笨蛋把他关在地下室里。只要你和史蒂夫达成协议，或者水箱里还有水，杰拉克就不会碰他。我们唯一的希望就是你把泵修好。。。你不会就这样离开我们吧？}
#{155}{}{Me and my brother only got here a short time ago, so I don't know much. A caravan merchant told us that everyone here works together to support the community, and we wanted to be part of that. I wish he'd told us that they'll kill you if you make a mistake!}
{155}{}{我和我哥哥不久前才到这里，所以我知道的不多。一位商队商人告诉我们，这里的每个人都在一起支持社区，我们希望成为其中的一员。我真希望他告诉我们如果你犯错他们会杀了你！}
#{156}{}{Gerlach's dead, so Steve's free. But what's the point? When no water will be left in the tank, they kill us anyway.}
{156}{}{杰拉克死了，史蒂夫自由了。但重点是什么？当水箱里没有水的时候，他们还是杀了我们。}
#{157}{}{I've thought about it, but I won't leave without my brother. He's all I've got.}
{157}{}{我已经考虑过了，但是没有我哥哥我是不会离开的。他是我的全部。}
#{158}{}{We'll have to find somewhere else to go. We don't have a choice - without Gerlach, this place will fall apart.}
{158}{}{我们得找个别的地方去。我们别无选择――没有杰拉克，这个地方就会分崩离析。}
#{159}{}{I'll go if everyone else goes.}
{159}{}{如果其他人都去，我就去。}
#{160}{}{Me and my brother only got here a short time ago, so I don't know much. A caravan merchant told us that everyone here works together to support the community, and we wanted to be part of that. I wish he'd told us that they'll kill you if you make a mistake!}
{160}{}{我和我哥哥不久前才到这里，所以我知道的不多。一位商队商人告诉我们，这里的每个人都在一起支持社区，我们希望成为其中的一员。我真希望他告诉我们如果你犯错他们会杀了你！}
#{200}{}{And for once I thought someone just wanted to help. Well, I don't have anything valuable, but I know where Gerlach has his good stuff hidden. If you help my brother, I'll show you.}
{200}{}{有一次我以为有人只是想帮忙。我没有什么值钱的东西，但我知道杰拉克的好东西藏在哪里。如果你帮我弟弟，我就给你看。}

{201}{}{有一次我以为有人只是想帮忙。我没有什么值钱的东西，但我知道杰拉克的好东西藏在哪里。}
#{202}{}{If this stuff is so good, why haven't you taken it yet?}
{202}{}{如果这东西这么好，你为什么还没拿呢？}
#{203}{}{Food, water, shelter and family is important to me. Money isn't. Anyway, Gerlach would figure it out pretty quick if someone in the community had his stuff. You don't have that problem.}
{203}{}{食物、水、住所和家庭对我很重要。钱不是。不管怎样，如果社区里有人有他的东西，Gerlach会很快发现的。你没有这个问题。}
#{204}{}{Show me the damn stash! I want everything in there!}
{204}{}{给我看看那该死的藏匿处！我要里面的一切！}
#{205}{}{Susie said the stash is somewhere around here.}
