#{100}{}{... I'm smoking a cigar, leaning against the wall. Your average night watch, you know what I mean.}

{300}{}{那个该死的窃贼就在我面前从房子的窗户跳了出去。}
#{400}{}{What an idiot!}

{700}{}{我正要对他大喊大叫，但突然柯特出现了。他就在我旁边守着。}

{800}{}{哦，操。柯特真是疯了。我听说有一次他因为向一个小孩扔石头而把他打死。}
#{900}{}{Yeah, he jumped at him right away. Man, he was beating the guy, kicking him. That oaf was going to call me for help.}
{900}{}{是的，他马上就跳过去了。伙计，他在打那家伙，踢他。那个笨蛋要打电话给我寻求帮助。}
#{1000}{}{Shit, that'd be trouble.}

#{1100}{}{Exactly, so I just shot him right there and then. Of course, Curt went all mad 'cause I spoiled him his fun.}
{1100}{}{没错，所以我就在那里开枪打了他。当然，柯特发疯了，因为我毁了他的乐趣。}
#{1200}{}{Well, it could have ended in real shit, it's good the way it is. So the guy's dead?}
{1200}{}{好吧，它可能会在真正的狗屎结束，这是很好的方式。那家伙死了？}
