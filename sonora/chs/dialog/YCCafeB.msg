{223}{}{不是最好的选择。自战争以来，他一直渴望利润，但他甚至赚不到新车的钱。呵呵，开玩笑吧。不管怎样，他说他要回到中心。我只是在说话，和你坐在同一张椅子上。}

{228}{}{我明白了。}

### {230}{}{Do you have anything stronger than old beer?}
{230}{}{你有比老啤酒更浓的吗？}

{241}{}{我们一群人正在寻找他的球队。也许你听说过他？}
### {242}{}{I heard that super mutants have set up a camp in Balboa Park. They are not aggressive, rather the opposite. Maybe this is the squad you're looking for.}
{242}{}{我听说超级变种人在巴尔博亚公园建立了一个营地。他们没有攻击性，恰恰相反。也许这就是你要找的球队。}
