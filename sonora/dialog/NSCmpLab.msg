### {211}{}{"Setting the research goal for the next five years: the creation of dry climate resistant and at the same time fruit-bearing crops suitable for mass cultivation. Thus - to solve the food problem in Arizona and California, which is faced by the modern growing population."}
{211}{}{“为未来五年设定研究目标：创造适合大规模种植的耐干旱气候同时结果实的作物。因此，解决亚利桑那州和加利福尼亚州的粮食问题，这是现代人口增长所面临的问题。”}
### {212}{}{The material base of the experiment.}
{212}{}{实验的物质基础。}
### {213}{}{"The work is being carried out on the basis of the well-preserved laboratory "Greenway Hydroponics", where, even before the Great War, various experiments were conducted to create drought-resistant and radiation-resistant plants. In particular, it was here that the materials included in the standard set of Vault-Tec Vaults for the survival of the population after a nuclear war were prepared."}
{213}{}{“这项工作是在保存完好的实验室“绿道水培”的基础上进行的，即使在第一次世界大战之前，那里也进行了各种实验，以创造耐旱和抗辐射的植物。特别是，正是在这里，为核战争后的人口生存准备了Vault Tec Vaults标准套件中的材料。”}

### {215}{}{"The laboratory has preserved: working inventory, automated hydroponic equipment, seeds of various plants and fungi not spoiled by radiation, rich laboratory documentation and pre-war literature, as well as a diverse set of chemicals, biological additives and viruses."}
{215}{}{“实验室保存了：工作库存、自动化水培设备、未被辐射破坏的各种植物和真菌的种子、丰富的实验室文件和战前文献，以及各种化学品、生物添加剂和病毒。”}
### {216}{}{Project objectives.}
{216}{}{项目目标。}
### {217}{}{"The first task is to study the research and material base of Greenway Hydroponics in order to restore the operation of the complex and laboratory. Among the local developments, there are ready-made solutions that can be used for the needs of Casa Nueva."}
{217}{}{“第一项任务是研究绿道水培的研究和材料基础，以恢复综合体和实验室的运营。在当地的发展中，有现成的解决方案可以满足Casa Nueva的需求。”}

### {219}{}{"The second task is the cultivation of plants solely to increase seed stocks. The work should be carried out in isolated greenhouses of the complex to create the cleanest and most comfortable environment."}
{219}{}{“第二项任务是种植植物，只是为了增加种子库存。这项工作应该在综合体的隔离温室中进行，以创造最干净、最舒适的环境。”}

### {222}{}{Important note.}
{222}{}{重要提示。}
### {223}{}{"One of the important conditions of the experiment is to stimulate the growth of plants, especially their root system. Various ways of this stimulation are assumed: biological additives, irradiation, fungal spores and even viruses from Greenway Hydroponics stocks. In order to increase safety, access to the laboratory should be strictly limited."}
{223}{}{“实验的重要条件之一是刺激植物的生长，尤其是它们的根系。假设有多种刺激方式：生物添加剂、辐射、真菌孢子，甚至来自Greenway水培植物种群的病毒。为了提高安全性，应严格限制进入实验室。”}
