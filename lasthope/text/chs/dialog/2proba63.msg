 What do you want, lost or something?}
{101}{}{Excuse me, who lives here?}
{102}{}{Sorry, keep doing whatever you were doing.}
#
{103}{}{Nobody "lives" here, this is the office of my boss, Aston. Do you have any business with him?}
{104}{}{I guess not.}
{105}{}{I'm looking for a job.}
# for job...
{107}{}{Look man, you don't look so tough to me. You've got to be better with guns if you are thinking about working
 for Aston. Now beat it!}
{108}{}{Alright.}
{109}{}{Why don't you make me!}
#for job2..
{110}{}{Well... OK. You can go in, but I'm watching you. Any sign of trouble and I'll throw your ass out!}
{111}{}{I heard you.}
{112}{}{You are going to throw me out!? Boy, you can't even keep me from coming in!}
#
{113}{}{OK, go in.}

{118}{}{Man, I don't wanna waste ammo!}
{119}{}{Keep away from that door!}
{120}{}{You are not getting in there.}
{121}{}{Don't touch the damn door!}
#

{124}{}{Waiting all day for someone to come...}
{125}{}{I'm watching you.}
{126}{}{Oh, man...}
# weapon plans copy...
{127}{}{I need a favor from your boss Aston, can I see him?}
#
{128}{}{Aston is not here. You're wasting your time.}
{129}{}{Oh, okay.}
