@Quotes from the development:
#(Press ESC to skip)



#FK doesn't like exit grids, move to commands and half-way 
#through development he decided that he doesn't like 
#else begin much either.

#M:
"Are you sure this is a good idea?"
#FK:
"It works, right?"
#M:
"Yeah..."
#FK:
"Fine, I leave it then."

#FK:
"This is not the twilight zone."
#- reply to a 800 word bug report

#M:
"Or you can just copy & pasta."
#FK:
"Yes, please."

#FK:
"All my maps were build by aliens."
#M:
"Those again. Ask them about Elvis."
#M:
"Anyway, I think they fixed the script this time."

#FK:
"Just a detail, I'm glad we agree on that."
#- after a proposal that a door should give 90 XP instead 85

#FK:
"I don't want to give too much attention to them, 
those scum deserve none."
#- regarding a bandit script

#FK:
"This brahmin doesn't go anywhere, ever, it's well 
trained. But I always wanted to have the option to get it 
drunk for some reason."

#FK:
"Interesting CSI reconstruction, I just removed the line."
#- after being offered a full fix of a node (in detail), 
#or to just delete the line... M won a bet with this one

#FK:
"Nice, you included a mapping tutorial."

#FK:
"Keep for later or recycle, but I keep going back asking 
myself what this does anyway :)."
#M:
"-.-"

#M:
"I'll be checking again. No more funny business. :)"
#FK:
"I'm counting on it. :)"

#FK:
"Back to the future (facepalm)."
#M:
"You did get lost along the way... :)"
#FK:
"That I'm guilty of. :)"

#FK:
"Exactly, if ever, corrected of course, we're not 
preparing for the apocalypse."

#FK:
"Yes, it's wrong, should be fine now. I was playing 
roulette while assigning town rep gvars, don't know what 
they do - don't care. :)"

#FK:
"I knew the F8 button would save the world! I believe 
in you, Willy!" 

#FK:
"Most people don't usually play Ghost Buster games, but 
when they do, they better consult you. :)"

#M:
"Yeah, you're right this is stupid... the fix isn't even 
better than the glitch..."

#M:
"Potential research project, maybe the frm or proto can 
be fixed..."
#FK:
"Oh no, don't go there. :)"

#FK:
"Np, lets move on if there's no angry mob waiting 
outside."

#M:
"I would clean that up, but it's up to you."
#FK:
"Well, hot potatoes! I used wall s.t mostly, I guess 
I'll do some "shovelling", just here. It will be our little 
secret."

#FK:
"I can edit everything that needs to be fixed, with or 
without patch000. Those are mostly for the main game and 
I'm not fixing the damn thing, that was Tim's job. :)"
#M:
"Still, we can take advantage of the stuff they did fix, 
especially the generic scripts (lockers, car trunk, dice 
girl etc.)."
#FK:
"My precious! Gollum doesn't want it... -.-"

#M:
"You forget to adjust Node014:"
#FK:
"(cursing in Klingon)...ghuy' "

#FK:
"This was easy, is everyone alive?"

#FK:
"I added some walls with no logical explanation of how 
they got there, but I like those, like the great wall of 
China. People like walls. :)"

#FK:
"Players don't usually think about the logic, they want 
more loot, we (the modders) are here to grant those wishes. 
:)s"

#FK:
"When you see how little I've followed your suggestions, 
you will surely make another report just for this.  JK:)"

#M:
"Then again, it may also sort itself out (as seen) and the 
crashes I had were save editor related."
#FK:
"It'll sort itself then, problem solved."

#M:
"(I can give you lists of items (of where they are), but 
not sure you want to do this atm.)"
#FK:
"Good guess, not doing this now. :)"

#M:
"Remove the Meat Jerky. It has script or something."

#FK:
"Exposition is da real killer here. Troy burned for this!"

#FK:
"Bandit leader is already VIP, no presidential pass 
given."
#20 minutes later...
#M:
"That's not the point!"

#M:
"Not the most stable of engines, is it? :)"
#FK:
"gm's tried, who am I to judge. :="
#- case-in-hand: player can click a ladder through a trapdoor

#FK:
"This is a bit harder than it looks."
#M:
"But you bloody did it! :) It works!"

#FK:
"Indeed, I kept files from early version 1.04 (2009), 
same error. I'm glad this will be fixed 10 years later. :)"

#FK:
"This door is slowly killing me."

#M:
"This scripting stuff is more fun than sudoku. :)"

#FK:
"That's a pretty long explanation of your scripting 
Frankenstein experiment. :)"

#FK:
"This was easy, so multiverse final formula is close, 
Nobel?"
#M:
"...almost. ;)"

#FK:
"I copy-paste, I robot."
