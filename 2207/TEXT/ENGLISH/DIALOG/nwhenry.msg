{10}{}{Mister, you are not from around here, aren't you? [he doesn't pause, as if being afraid that you'll go away not listening to him] Why do I even ask, I know every local, I'm from here myself. Name's Henry, by the way. Henry... And we need help! [he looks at you with his big puppy eyes]}
{11}{002}{"We"?}
{12}{004}{Help?}
{13}{005}{Tell me. Not so hastily though. Slowly, in detail.}
{14}{999}{Nah, kid. Get lost.}

#Node002
{20}{}{Well, uh, Becky, Sunny, and her dad. They are my friends, and they are in trouble!}
{21}{005}{Tell me. Not so hastily though. Slowly, in detail.}
{22}{003}{Nah, kid. I don't do charity helping. Talk to the town guards.}

#Node003
{30}{}{I tried! They won't help me...}
{31}{005}{Oh, man. Okay, talk. }
{32}{999}{Why should I care? Get lost.}

#Node004
{40}{}{Yes! Uh, my friends are in danger! They decided to risk their lives because the locals are so stubborn! And they are gone for a long time... They need to be rescued!}
{41}{005}{Whoa kid, you should do trading with your commitment. Tell me. Slowly, in detail.}
{42}{003}{Nah, kid. I don't do charity helping. Talk to the town guards.}

#Node005
{50}{}{[The kid catches his breath, gathering thoughts] Okay, here's the thing, not long ago there was a family of outsiders here in NWO. I mean, they are good people, but the locals never cared, because if you didn't ruin your health for the good of the settlement, you're going to be looked down upon here. So it was with them. Got to a point where they couldn't get any job which gives you anything except worsening your health. The traders put up high prices for them, the locals didn't help either. So, I told them about Pearson Town, stupid me...}
{51}{006}{Pearson Town?}
{52}{007}{I see folks are quite friendly around here.}

#Node006
{60}{}{Pearson Town is a little, well-preserved settlement - if you don't take into account those who inhabit it. Some say that there was a power plant there, but after it was bombed, no one was willing to go into the place... If you believe the stories of old men. [the kid stumbles] So, mostly intact town was covered with a cloud of radiation, and then there appeared Ferals, monsters, and other bad stuff. And we always had problems with medical supplies around here, but there, presumably, could be enough of them, remained from before the war. A lot. Some people ventured into it, searching - but were unsuccessful. So I told the girls about the place.}
{61}{008}{You told them? Why?}

#Node007
{70}{}{Well, yeah. But if you are part of NWO, you can be sure that everyone would stand for you. You are a part of the family.}
{71}{006}{What were you saying about Pearson Town?}

#Node008
{80}{}{Uh, well, not exactly me. Becky got hurt once, came to doctor Hinder, but he chased her away. He told her that he doesn't have medicines for such lowlife as her. And that he wouldn't help her even if she'd brought the band-aids from the Pearson Town itself. Becky spoke with Sunny, and Sunny asked me about the place. And I told her. Stupid.}
{81}{009}{So, they headed into Pearson Town for medical supplies in hope of being accepted into NWO?}

#Node009
{90}{}{Yes.}
{91}{012}{What the hell were they thinking?}
{92}{012}{This is genius. Considering the other ones from here couldn't handle it - guards, prospectors...}
{93}{011}{I see. Have something to add?}

#Node010
{100}{}{Mister, did you change your mind? Will you help us?}
{101}{999}{No, I was just walking by.}
{102}{005}{Let's refresh my memory. Tell me everything from the beginning.}
{103}{}{Mister, how's the search for my friends going?}
{104}{999}{In the process, Henry. In the process.}
{105}{}{Mister... You are the best person in the whole NWO! I will never forget that! It's a pity I have nothing to give you for my gratitude... But... Someday I'll repay my debt. I definitely will. And for now... I'll be praying for you. Thank you.}
{106}{999}{Good luck, kid! And don't tell your friends about dangerous places anymore.}

#Node011
{110}{}{I'm afraid, mister, I have nothing to offer you in return. And no one will. No one cares in NWO. But I can pray for you. I... Help me, please!}
{111}{999}{Okay, kid. I'll see what I can do [take the coordinates of Pearson Town]}
{112}{999}{Nah, kid. I don't do charity helping. Sorry. Maybe some another time.}
{113}{999}{Pray? I can pray myself. So I won't do anything without proper payment.}

#Node012
{120}{}{All they ever wanted is to be accepted... But... [the kid sighs]}
{121}{011}{I see. Have something to add?}
