#{200}{}{You see a man in a blue vault jumpsuit.}
{200}{}{你看到一个穿蓝色跳马服的男人。}
#{201}{}{You see a man in a blue vault jumpsuit. Small remains of yellow color indicate that a number was written on its back.}
{201}{}{你看到一个穿蓝色跳马服的男人。黄色的小残骸表明它的背面写着一个数字。}
#{250}{}{You see the Twelfth Reborn. He is waiting for you to leave him alone.}
{250}{}{你看到第十二个重生。他在等你别管他。}
#{300}{}{I want to be alone.}
{300}{}{我想一个人呆着。}
#{301}{}{Leave me alone, please.}

#{302}{}{I have to do it alone.}
{302}{}{我得一个人做。}
#{303}{}{I won't end up like the others before me.}
{303}{}{我不会像我之前的其他人那样结束。}
#{304}{}{Goodbye.}
{304}{}{再见。}
#{500}{}{Thirteenth! What are you doing here? You... You know, at first I hated you because I ended up here after your escape, but now I understand why you did it. I should've done it too, when I still had a chance.}
{500}{}{十三号！你在这里干什么？你。。。你知道，一开始我恨你是因为我在你逃跑后来到这里，但现在我明白你为什么这么做了。我也应该这么做，当我还有机会的时候。}
#{501}{}{You're a reborn, right?}
{501}{}{你重生了，对吧？}
#{502}{}{Gho?}
{502}{}{哦？}
#{550}{}{Yes. [He points to a man lying on the floor.] I know that it's difficult to recognize him, the Eleventh, but don't you recognize me? Just because the number twelve on my jumpsuit is worn-out?}
{550}{}{对。[他指了指躺在地板上的一个人]我知道很难认出他，十一号，但你认不出我吗？就因为我连身衣上的12号破了？}
#{551}{}{I lost my memory. Maybe you can help me recall a few things.}
{551}{}{我失去了记忆。也许你能帮我回忆一些事情。}
#{600}{}{You came back, you got in past all those guards... Answering a few of your questions is the least that I can do for you.}
{600}{}{你回来了，你超过了所有的警卫。。。回答你的几个问题是我至少能为你做的。}
#{601}{}{How did you become a reborn?}
{601}{}{你是怎么重生的？}
#{602}{}{What did you mean that you ended up here because of me?}
{602}{}{你是什么意思因为我才来这里的？}
#{603}{}{How did the Eleventh become a reborn?}
{603}{}{第十一个是如何重生的？}
#{604}{}{I don't need you to remind me anything. I know that I have to put an end to things here. Will you help me?}
{604}{}{我不需要你提醒我什么。我知道我必须结束这里的一切。你能帮我吗？}
#{650}{}{The whole affair about a prestigious rebirth for the best of us is fancy nonsense, I'm sure you already know this. The Savior chooses completely differently. I worked in Erick's research team. While going through the original data that was left here by the scientists of Vault-Tec, I found something odd - remains of some thoroughly deleted data. Even Erick didn't have any idea about its existence. I started to do some research, I tried to restore the deleted files and that's when I was chosen. Even though I knew that I wouldn't have much time left after the rebirth, I didn't mind. I was happy that my rebirth was going to come so soon and I felt incredibly honored that I was chosen and that I could increase the morale of all the people in the Rebirth. Oh God, how stupid I was.}
{650}{}{对于我们中的佼佼者来说，关于一个有声望的重生的整个事件都是无稽之谈，我相信你已经知道这一点了。救世主的选择完全不同。我在埃里克的研究小组工作。在浏览Vault Tec的科学家留下的原始数据时，我发现了一些奇怪的东西――一些彻底删除的数据的残余。就连埃里克也不知道它的存在。我开始做一些研究，我试图恢复删除的文件，这就是我被选中的时候。即使我知道我在重生后没有多少时间了，我也不介意。我很高兴我的重生来得这么快，我感到无比荣幸，我被选中，我可以提高所有人的士气在重生。天啊，我真傻。}
#{651}{}{And what about those deleted files?}
{651}{}{那些被删除的文件呢？}
#{652}{}{I don't need you to remind me anything else. I know that I have to put an end to things here. Will you help me?}
{652}{}{我不需要你提醒我其他的事。我知道我必须结束这里的一切。你能帮我吗？}
#{700}{}{I let it slip out of my head because of my rebirth, and then I was switched to do other work until I forgot about all of it. Only here I could think about it more. We keep the fact that the machine is broken in secret from others, but I'm telling you that the Savior must be keeping something secret from all of us.}
{700}{}{因为我的重生，我让它从我的脑海中溜走了，然后我被调换去做其他的工作，直到我忘记了所有的事情。只有在这里我才能想得更多。我们对其他人隐瞒了这台机器被破坏的事实，但我告诉你，救世主一定对我们所有人隐瞒了什么。}
#{701}{}{And what did you mean that you ended up here because of me?}
{701}{}{你是什么意思因为我才来这里的？}
#{702}{}{I don't need you to remind me anything else. I know that I have to put an end to things here. Will you help me?}
{702}{}{我不需要你提醒我其他的事。我知道我必须结束这里的一切。你能帮我吗？}
#{750}{}{Normally they lock you in here when it seems that the rebirth will start to show negative effects. Everybody thinks that we're taken good care of here and that we're going to finish ours lives here painlessly, but the truth is that we're glad when we even get something to eat, and they're interested in us only when they need to take samples from us for testing. They locked us here immediately after your escape, just to be on the safe side. The Tenth was already here, we watched him die in pain. It was several hours later when they took his body.}
{750}{}{通常情况下，他们会把你锁在这里，似乎重生会开始显示出负面影响。每个人都认为我们在这里得到了很好的照顾，我们将在这里无痛地结束我们的生活，但事实是，当我们甚至有东西吃的时候，我们都很高兴，只有当他们需要从我们这里采集样本进行测试时，他们才对我们感兴趣。为了安全起见，你逃跑后他们马上把我们锁在这里。第十个已经来了，我们看着他痛苦地死去。几个小时后，他们带走了他的尸体。}
#{751}{}{How did the Eleventh became a reborn?}
{751}{}{第十一个是如何重生的？}
#{752}{}{I don't need you to remind me anything else. I know that I have to put an end to things here. Will you help me?}
{752}{}{我不需要你提醒我其他的事。我知道我必须结束这里的一切。你能帮我吗？}
#{800}{}{He didn't have a clue. I asked him about it for so long that I finally found out. He worked as a computer technician with access only to yellow levels. When he was chosen to become reborn, out of all the people he was the most surprised. What exceptional deeds could he have done for the Rebirth, right? He inadvertently got a hold of some scientific report, from which he could deduce quite a lot about what was going on in the red levels, if only he could understand the report. But for the Savior, even that was enough to choose him. Poor man, only in this filthy jail he learned that the rebirth means an early, painful death.}
{800}{}{他一点线索也没有。我问了他很久，终于知道了。他是一名计算机技术员，只能使用黄色等级。当他被选为重生，在所有的人中他是最惊讶的。他能为重生做些什么特别的事，对吗？他无意中得到了一份科学报告，如果他能理解这份报告，他就可以从中推断出很多关于红色水平的情况。但对于救世主来说，即使这样也足以选择他。可怜的人，只有在这个肮脏的监狱里，他才明白重生意味着痛苦的早死。}
#{801}{}{Can we help him in any way?}
{801}{}{我们能帮他什么忙吗？}
#{802}{}{I don't need you to remind me anything else. I know that I have to put an end to things here. Will you help me?}
{802}{}{我不需要你提醒我其他的事。我知道我必须结束这里的一切。你能帮我吗？}
#{850}{}{Only to grant him a quick death, to relieve him of his pain. His body has been literally falling apart for more than a week and it will take a couple more days before he finally dies.}
{850}{}{只是为了让他快点死，减轻他的痛苦。他的身体实际上已经散架了一个多星期，他最终死亡还需要几天的时间。}
#{851}{}{I need to get this straight, can you repeat some things?}
{851}{}{我要把话说清楚，你能重复几句吗？}
#{852}{}{I have to put an end to these things. Will you help me?}
{852}{}{我必须结束这些事情。你能帮我吗？}
#{900}{}{I'm sorry, but I won't let my chance slip again. The chance to quickly kill myself while I still have the strength to do that. [He rolls up the sleeve on his right hand and exposes a large section of his arm with no skin, revealing just pulsating muscle. The decomposition of his cells already started.] I can do it now, thanks to you. You gave me the resolve and the means. I'll take a gun from the guards. I would like to be alone doing it. I wish you good luck, put a good use to what time you have left.}
{900}{}{对不起，我不会再错过机会了。趁我还有力气的时候赶紧自杀。[他卷起右手的袖子，露出一大块没有皮肤的手臂，只露出跳动的肌肉。他的细胞已经开始分解了]我现在可以做了，多亏了你。你给了我决心和手段。我从警卫那里拿把枪。我想一个人做。祝你好运，好好利用你剩下的时间。}
