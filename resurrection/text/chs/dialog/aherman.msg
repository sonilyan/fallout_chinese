#{100}{}{You see a Hunter commander.}
{100}{}{你看到一个猎人指挥官。}
#{150}{}{You see Herman.}
{150}{}{你看到赫尔曼了。}
#{200}{}{You see one of the Hunter commanders. He looks very strict.}
{200}{}{你看到一个猎人指挥官。他看起来很严厉。}
#{250}{}{You see Herman, the commander responsible for city security.}
{250}{}{你看赫尔曼，负责城市安全的指挥官。}
#{400}{}{Your actions are foolish.}
{400}{}{你的行为是愚蠢的。}
#{401}{}{You have no chance.}
{401}{}{你没有机会。}
#{402}{}{You're going to die here and now.}
{402}{}{你现在就要死在这里。}
#{500}{}{What are you doing here? You're not with the Hunters.}
{500}{}{你在这里干什么？你不是猎人。}
#{501}{}{Who are you?}
{501}{}{你是谁？}
#{502}{}{I want to join the Hunters.}
{502}{}{我想加入猎人队。}
#{503}{}{Nothing.}
{503}{}{没有什么。}
#{504}{}{Ghe brblegh!}
{504}{}{啊，布莱！}
#{550}{}{That's commendable, but these matters are handled by Kraig. You'll find him in the next room.}
{550}{}{这是值得称赞的，但这些事情是由克莱格处理的。你会在隔壁房间找到他的。}
#{551}{}{OK.}
{551}{}{好 啊。}
#{600}{}{I'm commander Herman, and I'm the one in charge of security inside the city. Will you tell me what you're doing here, then?}
{600}{}{我是赫尔曼指挥官，负责城内的安全。那你能告诉我你在这里干什么吗？}
#{601}{}{I want to join the Hunters.}
{601}{}{我想加入猎人队。}
#{602}{}{If it's about the security of the city, there are some things you should know.}
{602}{}{如果是关于城市的安全，有些事情你应该知道。}
#{603}{}{I'm a new potential recruit for the Hunters. I was supposed to report here.}
{603}{}{我是猎人队的新兵。我应该在这里报到的。}
#{604}{}{Nothing, actually. Goodbye.}
{604}{}{其实没什么。再见。}
#{650}{}{I'm listening.}
{650}{}{我在听。}
#{651}{}{There's a woman in the Suburbs called Catherine, whose daughter Sophie has six toes on each foot.}
{651}{}{郊区有个叫凯瑟琳的女人，她的女儿索菲每只脚有六个脚趾。}
#{652}{}{Chuck, the weapons dealer, is raping children. Specifically boys from the empire, and he's holding several of them captive by force.}
{652}{}{武器贩子查克强奸儿童。特别是帝国的男孩，他用武力俘虏了他们中的几个。}
#{653}{}{Chuck, the weapons dealer, has a weird fetish - he only does it with mutated children. He even holds a few of them in his cellar.}
{653}{}{武器贩子查克有一种奇怪的癖好――他只对变异的孩子这么做。他甚至在地窖里藏了一些。}
#{654}{}{Did you know that some pretty disgusting things are going on in the Dead Quarter hospital?}
{654}{}{你知道死区医院里发生了一些很恶心的事情吗？}
#{655}{}{A guy called Pus is selling food made from human meat in the Dead Quarter.}
{655}{}{一个叫Pus的家伙在死区卖人肉做的食物。}
#{656}{}{There's a gang running loose in the Suburbs, led by a guy called Vex.}
{656}{}{在郊区有一个帮派逍遥法外，由一个叫Vex的人领导。}
#{657}{}{I haven't heard anything.}
{657}{}{我什么都没听到。}
#{700}{}{I don't understand what kind of mother would let her child suffer this way. Had she come to us right away, we might have been able to help her daughter. But now, it's likely too late. We'll detain Sophie immediately, thank you for the information.}
{700}{}{我不明白什么样的母亲会让她的孩子这样受苦。如果她马上来找我们，我们也许能帮助她的女儿。但现在，可能太晚了。我们马上拘留索菲，谢谢你的消息。}
#{701}{}{What will happen to her?}
{701}{}{她会怎么样？}
#{702}{}{How about a reward?}
{702}{}{奖励怎么样？}
#{703}{}{There's one more thing you should know.}
{703}{}{还有一件事你应该知道。}
#{704}{}{You're welcome.}
{704}{}{不客气。}
#{750}{}{That's for our doctors to decide. Maybe they'll amputate both her legs, but, like I've said, it's probably too late. It will be necessary to end her suffering.}
{750}{}{那要由我们的医生来决定。也许他们会截肢她的双腿，但是，就像我说的，可能太晚了。有必要结束她的痛苦。}
#{751}{}{What?! I won't allow that!}
{751}{}{什么？！我不会允许的！}
#{752}{}{Will I get a reward for my info?}
{752}{}{我的信息会得到奖励吗？}
#{753}{}{There's one more thing you should know.}
{753}{}{还有一件事你应该知道。}
#{754}{}{OK.}
{754}{}{好 啊。}
#{800}{}{By giving me this information, you are helping us in our fight against mutants, and in saving all genetically pure humans, including you. That should be its own reward.}
{800}{}{通过给我这些信息，你在帮助我们对抗突变体，拯救所有基因纯正的人类，包括你。这应该是它自己的回报。}
#{801}{}{What will happen to Sophie?}
{801}{}{索菲会怎么样？}
#{802}{}{That's not enough, so I'll just beat the money out of you!}
{802}{}{这还不够，我就把你的钱打出去！}
#{803}{}{There's one more thing you should know.}
{803}{}{还有一件事你应该知道。}
#{804}{}{If you say so.}
{804}{}{如果你这样说。}
#{850}{}{Why won't the likes of you ever learn? Don't you see that by pointlessly defending mutants, you endanger your own species? I cannot let you threaten us all any longer.}
{850}{}{为什么像你这样的人永远学不到？难道你不明白，毫无意义地保护突变体，会危及你自己的物种吗？我不能再让你威胁我们了。}
#{851}{}{Try to stop me.}
{851}{}{试着阻止我。}
#{900}{}{No, you will merely die because of your greed.}
{900}{}{不，你只会因为贪婪而死。}
#{901}{}{We'll see.}
{901}{}{我们拭目以待。}
#{950}{}{I strongly doubt the veracity of your statement, but it doesn't matter. What we are trying to do is prevent pure humans from becoming extinct because of mutants. Things like that are none of my concern.}
{950}{}{我强烈怀疑你的陈述的真实性，但这无关紧要。我们要做的是阻止纯人类因为突变体而灭绝。像那样的事不关我的事。}
#{951}{}{There's one more thing you should know.}
{951}{}{还有一件事你应该知道。}
#{952}{}{What?! You don't care?!}
{952}{}{什么？！你不在乎？！}
#{953}{}{OK.}
{953}{}{好 啊。}
#{1000}{}{I already answered you, and I won't repeat myself.}
{1000}{}{我已经回答过你了，我不再重复了。}
#{1001}{}{Alright then.}
{1001}{}{那好吧。}
#{1002}{}{No way in hell. I'll kill Chuck myself, but first I'll take care of you!}
{1002}{}{绝对不行。我要亲手杀了查克，但首先我要照顾你！}
#{1050}{}{Something so disgusting cannot even be possible. I have no time to waste on your fabrications.}
{1050}{}{如此恶心的事情甚至不可能发生。我没有时间浪费在你的捏造上。}
#{1051}{}{Really? Look what I found in his place! [Give him your removed sixth toe.]}
{1051}{}{真正地？看看我在他的地方发现了什么！[把你的第六个脚趾给他。]}
#{1052}{}{He even exposes normal children to radiation to cause them to mutate! As long as there is even a small chance that something as revolting could be happening, shouldn't you at least go check?}
{1052}{}{他甚至把正常的孩子暴露在辐射下，使他们发生变异！只要有一点点的机会，像反抗的事情可能会发生，你不应该至少去检查一下吗？}
#{1053}{}{Your loss.}
{1053}{}{你的损失。}
#{1100}{}{A removed toe with clear signs of mutation. Chuck can't even be human if he needs to satisfy his perverted urges on mutants. I will send a few Hunters to check his place.}
{1100}{}{有明显变异迹象的脚趾被切除。如果查克需要满足他对变种人的变态欲望，他甚至不能成为人类。我会派几个猎人去检查他的住处。}
#{1101}{}{Will I get a reward for my info?}
{1101}{}{我的信息会得到奖励吗？}
#{1102}{}{There's one more thing you should know.}
{1102}{}{还有一件事你应该知道。}
#{1103}{}{Fine.}
{1103}{}{好的。}
#{1150}{}{A removed toe with clear signs of mutation. Chuck can't even be human if he needs to satisfy his perverted urges on mutants. I will send a few Hunters to check his place. And if he's guilty, we'll get medieval on his ass.}
{1150}{}{有明显变异迹象的脚趾被切除。如果查克需要满足他对变种人的变态欲望，他甚至不能成为人类。我会派几个猎人去检查他的住处。如果他有罪，我们就揍他一顿。}
#{1151}{}{Will I get a reward for my info?}
{1151}{}{我的信息会得到奖励吗？}
#{1152}{}{There's one more thing you should know.}

#{1201}{}{That's not enough, so I'll just beat the money out of you!}
{1201}{}{这还不够，我就把你的钱打出去！}
#{1202}{}{In that case, there's one more thing you should know.}
{1202}{}{那样的话，还有一件事你应该知道。}
#{1203}{}{If you say so.}
{1203}{}{如果你这样说。}
#{1250}{}{You're right, that definitely needs to be verified. I will immediately send a few men to take care of it. And if he's guilty, we'll get medieval on his ass.}
{1250}{}{你说得对，那肯定需要核实。我马上派几个人来处理。如果他有罪，我们就揍他一顿。}
#{1251}{}{Will I get a reward for my info?}
{1251}{}{我的信息会得到奖励吗？}
#{1252}{}{There's one more thing you should know.}

#{1302}{}{There's one more thing you should know.}
{1302}{}{还有一件事你应该知道。}
#{1303}{}{Fine.}
{1303}{}{好的。}
#{1350}{}{He buys his meat from the hospital. Thus, there is no risk it could be mutated.}
{1350}{}{他从医院买肉。因此，它没有变异的风险。}
#{1351}{}{There's one more thing you should know.}
{1351}{}{还有一件事你应该知道。}
#{1352}{}{You know what's going on there and you still don't care?!}
{1352}{}{你知道那里发生了什么你还是不在乎？！}
#{1353}{}{OK.}
{1353}{}{好 啊。}
#{1400}{}{I don't need to listen to what goes on in the hospital. The constant complaints from doctor Yaotzin are quite enough. I am well aware of everything the doctors do there, those are just regular business transactions. And any mutants are simply removed from these transactions. The doctors are responsible people.}
{1400}{}{我不需要听医院里发生的事。Yaotzin医生不断的抱怨已经足够了。我很清楚医生在那里做的每件事，那只是正常的商业交易。任何变种都会从这些交易中移除。医生是负责任的人。}
#{1401}{}{There's one more thing you should know.}
{1401}{}{还有一件事你应该知道。}
#{1402}{}{You know what's going on there and you still don't care?!}

#{1451}{}{Alright then.}
{1451}{}{那好吧。}
#{1452}{}{No way in hell! You'll die for this!}
{1452}{}{不可能！你会为此而死的！}
#{1500}{}{Petty matters of immigrants are none of our business, unless they concern mutants.}
{1500}{}{移民的小事不关我们的事，除非他们涉及变种人。}
#{1501}{}{There's one more thing you should know.}
{1501}{}{还有一件事你应该知道。}
#{1502}{}{You don't care about a rampaging gang?!}
{1502}{}{你不在乎一帮暴徒？！}
#{1503}{}{OK.}
{1503}{}{好 啊。}
#{1550}{}{Is there a reason for your repeated visit?}
{1550}{}{你一再来访有什么原因吗？}
#{1551}{}{I want to join the Hunters.}
{1551}{}{我想加入猎人队。}
#{1552}{}{There are some things you should know.}

{1553}{}{我是猎人队的新兵。我应该在这里报到的。}
#{1554}{}{I want to know what happened to Chuck.}
{1554}{}{我想知道查克怎么了。}
#{1555}{}{Doctor Falber told me to inform you that he's planning to capture all the tribals in the Suburbs. He wanted to inform the Mutant Hunters beforehand to prevent any misunderstandings.}
{1555}{}{法伯医生告诉我要通知你他计划捕获郊区所有的部落。他想事先通知变种猎人，以防止任何误解。}
#{1556}{}{Not really, goodbye.}
{1556}{}{不太好，再见。}
#{1557}{}{Ghe brblegh!}
{1557}{}{啊，布莱！}
#{1600}{}{So you're the one. There is one matter right now that needs to be handled quickly.}
{1600}{}{所以你就是那个人。现在有一件事需要迅速处理。}
#{1601}{}{What's the matter?}
{1601}{}{怎么了}
#{1650}{}{We found out that among the tribals in the Suburbs there is a one that shows severe signs of mutation. Nothing unusual, given their lifestyle, these things happen often. And they always cause trouble because they try to defend the mutated tribals from us. They aren't intelligent enough to understand how self-destructive their behavior is.}
{1650}{}{我们发现在郊区的部落中有一个显示出严重变异的迹象。没有什么不寻常的，考虑到他们的生活方式，这些事情经常发生。他们总是制造麻烦，因为他们试图保护变异部落免受我们的攻击。他们不够聪明，无法理解自己的行为有多自我毁灭。}
#{1651}{}{What am I supposed to do about him then?}
{1651}{}{那我该怎么办呢？}
#{1700}{}{Two Hunters will join you and you'll bring the mutant to our base together. Should he resist, kill him and bring his body.}
{1700}{}{两个猎人会加入你，你会把变种人带到我们的基地。如果他反抗，杀了他，把他的尸体带来。}
#{1701}{}{What if the other tribals try to defend him?}
{1701}{}{如果其他部落试图保护他呢？}
#{1702}{}{OK.}
{1702}{}{好 啊。}
#{1703}{}{I won't do that!}
{1703}{}{我不会那么做的！}
#{1750}{}{We've already explained to them that we won't tolerate helping mutants in any way. Kill anyone who tries to defend him.}
{1750}{}{我们已经向他们解释过，我们不会容忍以任何方式帮助突变体。杀死任何试图保护他的人。}
#{1751}{}{OK.}
{1751}{}{好 啊。}
#{1752}{}{I won't do that!}
{1752}{}{我不会那么做的！}
#{1800}{}{In that case you can't became a Mutant Hunter. If you're able to take care of the mutant, you'll get a chance to become a Hunter, and if not, you'll be able to go on with your pointless life. Your choice.}
{1800}{}{那样的话，你就不能成为变种猎人。如果你能照顾好这个变种人，你就有机会成为一名猎人，如果不能，你就可以继续你毫无意义的生活。你的选择。}
#{1801}{}{Alright, I'll do it.}
{1801}{}{好吧，我来做。}
#{1802}{}{I won't do it, I don't want to be a Hunter anymore.}
{1802}{}{我不干了，我不想再当猎人了。}
#{1850}{}{Then we have nothing else to discuss.}
{1850}{}{那我们就没有别的事要谈了。}
#{1851}{}{Goodbye.}
{1851}{}{再见。}
#{1852}{}{Yeah, enough talk. Now it's time to kill you all for what you're doing.}
{1852}{}{是啊，说够了。现在是时候杀了你们所有人了。}
#{1900}{}{The tribals will likely never learn, even if it costs them their lives. You've done what you had to to secure the mutant, and I approve of you joining the Hunters.}
{1900}{}{部落很可能永远也学不到，即使他们为此付出了生命的代价。你做了你必须做的来保护变种人，我赞成你加入猎人。}
#{1901}{}{The tribals will likely never learn, even if it costs them their lives. You've done what you had to to secure the mutant, and I approve of you joining the Hunters.}
{1901}{}{部落很可能永远也学不到，即使他们为此付出了生命的代价。你做了你必须做的来保护变种人，我赞成你加入猎人。}
#{1902}{}{Thank you.}
{1902}{}{非常感谢。}
#{1903}{}{Yeeeah!}
{1903}{}{是啊！}
#{1950}{}{You've handled the mutant situation well, bringing him in without interference from the other tribals. I approve of you joining the Hunters.}
{1950}{}{你很好地处理了变异人的情况，没有受到其他部落的干扰就把他带进来了。我赞成你加入猎人队。}
#{1951}{}{You've handled the mutant situation well, bringing him in without interference from the other tribals. I approve of you joining the Hunters.}
{1951}{}{你很好地处理了变异人的情况，没有受到其他部落的干扰就把他带进来了。我赞成你加入猎人队。}
#{1952}{}{What will happen to him?}
{1952}{}{他会怎么样？}
#{1953}{}{Thank you.}
{1953}{}{非常感谢。}
#{1954}{}{Yeeeah!}
{1954}{}{是啊！}
#{2000}{}{The doctors found out that there's nothing that can be done, they'll have to put him down. You'll have to ask doctor Yaotzin whether they'll execute him or use him for some experiments.}
{2000}{}{医生们发现没什么办法了，只好把他放下来。你得问问姚津医生他们是要处决他还是用他做实验。}
#{2001}{}{OK.}
{2001}{}{好 啊。}
#{2050}{}{I don't want to give you my assessment until I get a full report from the Hunters I sent to him.}
{2050}{}{我不想给你我的评估，直到我从我寄给他的猎人那里得到一份完整的报告。}
#{2051}{}{There's one more thing you should know.}
{2051}{}{还有一件事你应该知道。}
#{2052}{}{Got it.}
{2052}{}{知道了。}
#{2100}{}{Chuck admitted his guilt by not letting the Hunters search his house. He tried to stop our men from entering with a weapon in hand. That's why they immediately terminated him, as well as the mutants he held in his cellar. The atrocities he committed will not happen again.}
{2100}{}{查克承认自己有罪，不让猎人搜查他的房子。他试图阻止我们的人手持武器进入。这就是为什么他们立即终止了他，以及他在地窖里关押的变种人。他犯下的暴行不会再发生了。}
#{2101}{}{There's one more thing you should know.}
{2101}{}{还有一件事你应该知道。}
#{2102}{}{They didn't even check if the children were really mutated?}
{2102}{}{他们甚至没有检查孩子是否真的变异了？}
#{2103}{}{I see.}
{2103}{}{我懂了。}
#{2104}{}{They killed even the kids? Someone will pay for that, and it might as well be you!}
{2104}{}{他们连孩子都杀了？有人会为此付出代价的，也可能是你！}
#{2150}{}{For what reason do you wish to speak with me again, Hunter?}
{2150}{}{你为什么想再和我说话，亨特？}
#{2151}{}{There are some things you should know.}
{2151}{}{有些事你应该知道。}
#{2152}{}{I have a few questions.}
{2152}{}{我有几个问题。}
#{2153}{}{I want to know what happened to Chuck.}
{2153}{}{我想知道查克怎么了。}

#{2155}{}{No reason, my apologies.}
{2155}{}{没有理由，我道歉。}

#{2200}{}{Ask.}

#{2204}{}{What would you do if there weren't any more mutants?}
{2204}{}{如果没有更多的变种你会怎么做？}
#{2205}{}{I've nothing to ask.}
{2205}{}{我没什么好问的。}
#{2250}{}{Mutants have no right to live and represent a clear threat to humankind.}
{2250}{}{变种人无权生存，对人类构成明显威胁。}

#{2253}{}{What would you do if there weren't any more mutants?}
{2253}{}{如果没有更多的变种你会怎么做？}
#{2254}{}{That's all I needed.}
{2254}{}{这就是我所需要的。}
#{2300}{}{Sebastian is an intelligent and, more importantly, capable leader. With him in charge, we have the best chance of ridding the world of mutants.}
{2300}{}{塞巴斯蒂安是一个聪明的，更重要的是，有能力的领导者。有了他，我们就有最好的机会消灭世界上的变种人。}

{2303}{}{如果没有更多的变种你会怎么做？}
#{2304}{}{That's all I needed.}
{2304}{}{这就是我所需要的。}
#{2350}{}{Sebastian is an intelligent and, more importantly, capable leader. He'd never tolerate the uncertainty caused by the rumors of his death. It is likely that he is really dead.}
{2350}{}{塞巴斯蒂安是一个聪明的，更重要的是，有能力的领导者。他决不能容忍他死亡的谣言所带来的不确定性。他很可能真的死了。}

{2353}{}{如果没有更多的变种你会怎么做？}
#{2354}{}{That's all I needed.}
{2354}{}{这就是我所需要的。}
#{2400}{}{I would continue to search for them, so that I could eliminate them if any of them survived or reappeared. Mutants are a threat that must never be underestimated.}

#{2404}{}{That's all I needed.}

#{2456}{}{That's all I needed.}
{2456}{}{这就是我所需要的。}
#{2500}{}{The Suburbs are a high-risk area. Even thought Dutch is doing his best, it's not possible to catch every mutant that blends in with the immigrants.

{2500}{}{郊区是高风险地区。即使荷兰人尽了最大努力，也不可能抓住每一个与移民融合的变种人。移民们也不太愿意与我们合作，尽管他们因为变种人而失去了家园。部落尤其糟糕，因为他们之间的突变率很高。}

#{2550}{}{The Dead Quarter is actually just ruins that remained after the second attack of the Rebirth. It's filled to the brim with beggars and junkies that don't even care about their own lives, let alone anything else. The only one hundred percent clean place in the Dead Quarter is the hospital.}
{2550}{}{死区实际上只是重生第二次攻击后留下的废墟。到处都是乞丐和瘾君子，他们甚至都不关心自己的生活，更别说别的了。死区唯一百分之百干净的地方是医院。}
#{2551}{}{Tell me about the Suburbs.}
{2551}{}{告诉我郊区的情况。}
#{2552}{}{Tell me about the Hunters' Territory.}
{2552}{}{告诉我猎人的领地。}
#{2553}{}{Tell me about the Imperial City.}
{2553}{}{告诉我关于皇城的事。}
#{2554}{}{I had other questions.}
{2554}{}{我还有其他问题。}
#{2555}{}{That's all I needed.}
{2555}{}{这就是我所需要的。}
#{2600}{}{The local immigrants gave that name to this quarter. The mutants don't dare to enter the areas around our base, meaning that this quarter is completely clean.}
{2600}{}{当地移民给这个地区起了这个名字。变种人不敢进入我们基地周围的地区，这意味着这个地区是完全干净的。}
#{2601}{}{Tell me about the Suburbs.}
{2601}{}{告诉我郊区的情况。}
#{2602}{}{Tell me about the Dead Quarter.}
{2602}{}{告诉我死区的事。}
#{2603}{}{Tell me about the Imperial City.}
{2603}{}{告诉我关于皇城的事。}
#{2604}{}{I had other questions.}
{2604}{}{我还有其他问题。}
#{2605}{}{That's all I needed.}
{2605}{}{这就是我所需要的。}
#{2650}{}{The behavior of the imperial dwellers is pointless and self-destructive. The mutants pose even a greater threat to them, because they want their technology and despise the vault dwellers. Despite that, they won't allow us to enter their part of the city, and I have received reports that they may even be harboring a few mutants there.}
{2650}{}{帝国居民的行为是毫无意义和自我毁灭的。变种人对他们构成了更大的威胁，因为他们想要他们的技术，而鄙视金库居民。尽管如此，他们不允许我们进入他们的城市，我收到报告说，他们甚至可能在那里窝藏一些变种人。}
#{2651}{}{Tell me about the Suburbs.}
{2651}{}{告诉我郊区的情况。}
#{2652}{}{Tell me about the Dead Quarter.}
{2652}{}{告诉我死区的事。}
#{2653}{}{Tell me about the Hunters' Territory.}
{2653}{}{告诉我猎人的领地。}
#{2654}{}{I had other questions.}
{2654}{}{我还有其他问题。}
#{2655}{}{That's all I needed.}
{2655}{}{这就是我所需要的。}
#{2700}{}{I see. Your presence here is more than unnecessary. Leave.}
{2700}{}{我懂了。你的出现是多余的。离开。}
#{2701}{}{Hu.}
{2701}{}{胡。}
#{2702}{}{Grrr!}
{2702}{}{格瑞！}
#{2750}{}{That was no longer necessary at that point, so they burned the mutant bodies on the spot. I understand your concern, I also think their behavior was more zealous than necessary. Doctor Yaotzin could've used the bodies for his experiments.}
{2750}{}{那时候已经不需要了，所以他们当场烧掉了变种人的尸体。我理解你的担心，我也认为他们的行为过于热心。Yaotzin医生可以用这些尸体做实验。}
#{2751}{}{There's one more thing you should know.}
{2751}{}{还有一件事你应该知道。}
#{2752}{}{I see.}
{2752}{}{我懂了。}
#{2753}{}{You murderers! Someone will pay for that, and it might as well be you!}
{2753}{}{你们这些杀人犯！有人会为此付出代价的，也可能是你！}
#{2800}{}{Very well. I know that doctor Falber is a responsible man. But this matter concerns a large number of tribals, and mutations are very frequent among them. He should pay special attention to that and send all the mutants he secures to us.}
{2800}{}{很好。我知道福伯医生是个负责任的人。但这个问题涉及到大量的部落，其中突变非常频繁。他应该特别注意这一点，把所有他找到的变种人都交给我们。}
#{2801}{}{Alright, I'll pass it on.}
{2801}{}{好吧，我把它传下去。}
#{2802}{}{If the tribal community causes trouble for the Hunters, doctor Falber will be helping you by removing them. And not just you, but the whole human race. In return, you shouldn't add to his burden by making him worry about delivering the mutants to you and just let him handle their extermination. You know you can trust him in this.}
{2802}{}{如果部落社区给猎人带来麻烦，法伯医生会帮你把他们赶走。不仅是你，还有整个人类。作为回报，你不应该增加他的负担，让他担心把变种人交给你，让他来处理他们的灭绝。你知道你可以信任他。}
#{2850}{}{Very well. May his hospital take care of terminating the mutants as always.}
{2850}{}{很好。愿他的医院一如既往地负责终止变种人。}
#{2851}{}{Thank you, I'll pass it on.}
{2851}{}{谢谢，我把它传下去。}
#{2900}{}{So you're the one. In that case, I don't approve of you joining us. I've received reports about your contacts with the local tribals. They are the group with the highest risk of mutations, which means that so are you. We have nothing else to discuss.}
{2900}{}{所以你就是那个人。那样的话，我不赞成你加入我们。我收到报告说你和当地部落有联系。他们是突变风险最高的群体，也就是说你也是。我们没有别的事要谈。}
#{2901}{}{Goodbye then.}
{2901}{}{那就再见了。}
#{2902}{}{Yeah, enough talk. Now it's time to kill you all for what you're doing.}
{2902}{}{是啊，说够了。现在是时候杀了你们所有人了。}
#{2950}{}{So you're the one. We know about your non-negligible contact with the empire, don't try to hide it. Unfortunately, the empire has revealed itself to be too untrustworthy for us to risk accepting a potential spy of theirs into our midst. I have no doubt that that would be a fitting role for a seemingly new stranger like you.}
{2950}{}{所以你就是那个人。我们知道你和帝国有着不可忽视的联系，别想隐瞒。不幸的是，帝国已经暴露出自己太不可信了，我们不能冒险接受他们的潜在间谍进入我们中间。我毫不怀疑，对于像你这样一个看似陌生的人来说，那将是一个合适的角色。}
#{2951}{}{So you're the one. We know about your non-negligible contact with the empire, don't try to hide it.

#{2952}{}{I see there's no point in trying to change your mind. Goodbye.}
{2952}{}{我看你没必要改变主意。再见。}
