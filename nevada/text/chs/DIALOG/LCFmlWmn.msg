#{172}{}{Well when you'll work, come and cry about it, for now the house is on my shoulders.}
{172}{}{好吧，当你工作的时候，过来为它哭泣吧，因为现在房子在我的肩上。}
#{173}{}{And what have you done, idiot?! You only do crap around the house, while I repair and fix everything!}
{173}{}{你做了什么，白痴？！你只是在家里胡闹，而我却在修理和修理一切！}
#{174}{}{I can see you really appreciate my work, do you?}
{174}{}{我看得出你真的很欣赏我的工作，是吗？}
#{175}{}{Why don't you appreciate mine, huh?!}
{175}{}{你为什么不欣赏我的，嗯？！}
#{176}{}{What *yours*? What have you done in the last year?}

#{229}{}{Do not defraud the male right of primacy, bitch!}
{229}{}{别骗取男人的优先权，婊子！}
#{230}{}{It's Merck. He's always yelling at me. That bastard... Did so much for him... And he... Only thinks about himself! All "me" and "me"...}
{230}{}{是默克公司。他总是对我大喊大叫。那个混蛋。。。为他做了那么多。。。他。。。只想着他自己！所有的“我”和“我”。。。}

{232}{}{他为什么这么做？}
#{233}{}{Is he always so aggressive?}

#{245}{}{Yes, sure, sorry.}
{245}{}{是的，当然，对不起。}
#{250}{}{It's immediately evident that you are not a fun of drunks. Such men as Merck don't need a reason - they find it themselves, if they want. No matter how I behave - it does not matter.}
{250}{}{很明显你不是酒鬼的笑柄。像默克这样的人不需要理由――只要他们愿意，他们自己就能找到理由。不管我怎么做-都没关系。}
#{251}{}{A typical guy with big balls. And he wants everyone to know this. Thinks of himself a master and the big man. Although in fact, can't even repair a door at the closet.}
{251}{}{典型的大家伙。他想让每个人都知道这一点。认为自己是一个大师和大人物。虽然事实上，连衣柜的门都修不好。}
#{252}{}{No, only when he's drunk. And this happens almost every day. When he is sober, he is even pleasant to talk with, he can joke and say a few nice words...}
{252}{}{不，只有在他喝醉的时候。这几乎每天都在发生。当他清醒的时候，他甚至乐于与人交谈，他可以开玩笑，说几句好话。。。}
#{253}{}{Who in this town will help a person in need? The Sheriff does not want to interfere with family problems, and neighbors and acquaintances do not want to make enemies. And what can they do? Come with a gun and shoot him in the head? It's cruel and dangerous.}
{253}{}{这个镇上谁会帮助一个需要帮助的人？治安官不想干涉家庭问题，邻居和熟人也不想树敌。他们能做什么？拿枪来打他的头？这既残酷又危险。}
#{254}{}{I'll help you then!}
{254}{}{那我就帮你！}
#{255}{}{Why! Why do you need these problems?}
{255}{}{为什么？你为什么需要这些问题？}
#{256}{}{I'm looking to benefit from this.}
{256}{}{我希望从中受益。}
#{257}{}{I just want to help - I do not tolerate women's tears.}
{257}{}{我只是想帮忙-我不能容忍女人的眼泪。}
#{258}{}{You need help, don't you? Why do you care about my motives?}
{258}{}{你需要帮助，是吗？你为什么关心我的动机？}
#{259}{}{What am I saying! can't help. Sorry.}
{259}{}{我在说什么！没办法。对不起的。}
#{260}{}{If I had a mercenary, I would have hired him long time ago.}
{260}{}{如果我有一个佣兵，我早就雇佣他了。}
#{261}{}{How noble of you. To my regret, I have long lost trust in strangers.}
{261}{}{你真高尚。令我遗憾的是，我早就对陌生人失去了信任。}
#{262}{}{Hmm, and you know - you're right!}
{262}{}{嗯，你知道-你说得对！}
#{263}{}{Do you have any plan?}
{263}{}{你有什么计划吗？}
#{264}{}{Maybe, but I don't want to help you anymore. Bye.}
{264}{}{也许吧，但我不想再帮你了。再见。}
#{265}{}{How noble of you. I hope you have enough heart for it.}
{265}{}{你真高尚。我希望你有足够的心去做。}
#{266}{}{Don't worry! Do you have any plan?}
{266}{}{别担心！你有什么计划吗？}
#{267}{}{Plan? And I hoped that you will come up with it yourself. Okay. I have a bottle of poisoned moonshine. But I don't have the heart to do it. Besides, he might suspect me, because I never gave him a drink like that.}
{267}{}{计划？我希望你自己能想出办法。可以。我有一瓶毒私酒。但我不忍心这么做。另外，他可能会怀疑我，因为我从来没有给过他那样的饮料。}
#{268}{}{Give me that poison.}
{268}{}{把毒药给我。}
#{269}{}{Something else?}
{269}{}{还有别的吗？}
#{270}{}{No need, I'll figure out the rest myself.}
{270}{}{不用了，剩下的我自己解决。}
#{271}{}{Okay, good luck.}
{271}{}{好吧，祝你好运。}

{272}{}{[退出]}
#{273}{}{Well, the local police are unlikely to interfere with our family, if it comes to a fight don't worry you know? Just so you know.}
{273}{}{好吧，当地警察不太可能干涉我们的家庭，如果是打架，别担心，你知道吗？只是想让你知道。}

{277}{}{我不需要任何其他东西，我会用我自己的方法更进一步。}
#{278}{}{That's enough. I'll figure out the rest myself.}
{278}{}{够了。剩下的我自己想办法。}
#{279}{}{I'll figure out the rest myself.}
{279}{}{剩下的我自己想办法。}
#{1220}{}{And you are an optimist, you know? Unfortunately, this hasn't saved anyone in our world...}
