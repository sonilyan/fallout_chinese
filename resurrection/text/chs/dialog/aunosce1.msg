#{300}{}{Don't come see me again, I don't want anyone finding out I spilled my beans.}
{300}{}{别再来看我了，我不想让任何人发现我把话说漏了。}
#{301}{}{You got no idea who you're dealing with. I work for Vex and you're as good as dead!}
{301}{}{你不知道你在和谁打交道。我为Vex工作你就死定了！}
#{302}{}{Just because Vex is dead, the rest of us won't just take shit from anyone.}
{302}{}{就因为维克斯死了，我们其他人就不会从任何人那里拿走屎。}
#{1150}{}{Whatdaya want?}
{1150}{}{你想要什么？}
#{1151}{}{I'm looking for a man who was trying to arrange a private caravan in Sedit Caravans not long ago.}
{1151}{}{我在找一个人，他不久前还想在塞迪特商队安排一个私人商队。}
#{1152}{}{Nothing, my mistake, sorry.}

#{1200}{}{That would be me.}

#{1201}{}{I'm well aware that the son of the Sedit Sheriff was in that caravan. Spill it, where is he?}
{1201}{}{我很清楚塞迪特警长的儿子就在那辆大篷车里。说出来，他在哪？}
#{1250}{}{I'm afraid you know more than is healthy for you. Let me take care of that.}
{1250}{}{恐怕你知道的不只是健康。让我来处理。}
#{1251}{}{I can draw faster than you. Trust me on this one, pal. But I'm not gonna kill you, just drag you back to Carpenter so that you can find out for yourself how furious he is. He'll be grateful to have someone to let his anger out on. How about that?}
{1251}{}{我画得比你快。相信我，伙计。但我不会杀了你，只要把你拖回卡彭特身边，你就能知道他有多愤怒。他会感激有人发泄他的愤怒。怎么样？}
#{1252}{}{How about you told me a little bit more, for a nice sum of caps, that is.}
{1252}{}{不如你再多告诉我一点，好一点。}

#{1301}{}{After you!}
{1301}{}{跟着你！}
#{1350}{}{Hey hey, calm down, I'm a reasonable man. Vex has the boy. A lot of people from the Suburb work for him, including me. He lives in that large decaying building over there. The boy should be locked up somewhere in the cellar below.}
{1350}{}{嘿嘿，冷静点，我是个通情达理的人。维克斯抓到了那个男孩。很多郊区的人都为他工作，包括我。他住在那边那栋破旧的大楼里。那男孩应该被锁在地下室的某个地方。}
#{1351}{}{See, didn't even hurt.}
{1351}{}{你看，我都不疼。}
#{1352}{}{Hey hey, calm down, I'm a reasonable man. Vex planned it all when he was still alive. A lot of people from the Suburb had been working for him and some of them decided to finish the job even without him. They are hiding in the cellar below Vex's house, keeping the boy locked up.}
{1352}{}{嘿嘿，冷静点，我是个通情达理的人。维克斯还活着的时候就计划好了。很多来自郊区的人一直在为他工作，其中一些人决定即使没有他也要完成这项工作。他们躲在维克斯家下面的地窖里，把男孩关起来。}
#{1400}{}{They pay me very well. It would have to be a significant sum to make me even consider it.}
{1400}{}{他们付给我很高的薪水。这将是一个重要的数目，使我甚至考虑它。}
#{1401}{}{I guess 1000 caps should be enough to persuade you to tell me where the sheriff's son is.}
{1401}{}{我想1000个瓶盖就足够说服你告诉我警长的儿子在哪里了。}
#{1402}{}{I guess 2000 caps should be enough to persuade you to tell me where the sheriff's son is.}
{1402}{}{我想2000个瓶盖足够说服你告诉我警长的儿子在哪里了。}
#{1403}{}{I guess 3000 caps should be enough to persuade you to tell me where the sheriff's son is.}
{1403}{}{我想3000个瓶盖足够说服你告诉我警长的儿子在哪里了。}
#{1404}{}{I don't have too many caps on me. I'd rather take you down and read the answer from your entrails.}
{1404}{}{我身上没有太多瓶盖。我宁愿把你带下来，从你的内脏里读出答案。}
#{1450}{}{I'm all in for such easy money. Vex got the boy. A lot of people from the Suburb work for him, including me. He lives in that large decaying building over there. The boy should be locked up somewhere in the cellar below.}
{1450}{}{我真想赚这么容易的钱。维克斯抓住了那个男孩。很多郊区的人都为他工作，包括我。他住在那边那栋破旧的大楼里。那男孩应该被锁在地下室的某个地方。}
#{1451}{}{Great.}
{1451}{}{伟大的。}
#{1452}{}{I'm all in for such easy money. Vex planned it all when he was still alive. A lot of people from the Suburb had been working for him and some of them decided to finish the job even without him. They are hiding in the cellar below Vex's house, keeping the boy locked up.}
{1452}{}{我真想赚这么容易的钱。维克斯还活着的时候就计划好了。很多来自郊区的人一直在为他工作，其中一些人决定即使没有他也要完成这项工作。他们躲在维克斯家下面的地窖里，把男孩关起来。}
#{1500}{}{That's not nearly enough for me to risk someone finding out that I talked. I'd rather try and get some caps for your head.}
{1500}{}{这还不足以让我冒险让别人发现我说的话。我宁愿试着给你的头戴上瓶盖。}
#{1501}{}{Go ahead, try your luck.}
{1501}{}{去吧，试试你的运气。}
