#{100}{}{You see the commander of the Hunters.}
{100}{}{你看到猎人的指挥官了。}
#{150}{}{You see Tulsa.}
{150}{}{你看到塔尔萨了。}
#{200}{}{You see one of the commanding officers of the Mutant Hunters. He has a faint smirk on his face.}
{200}{}{你看到一个变种猎人的指挥官。他脸上带着淡淡的笑容。}
#{250}{}{You see Tulsa, the commander of the Albuquerque base.}
{250}{}{你看到塔尔萨，阿尔伯克基基地的指挥官。}
#{300}{}{::snore::}
{300}{}{●打鼾：}
#{350}{}{What the hell is going on over there?! You...}
{350}{}{那到底是怎么回事？！你。。。}
#{400}{}{Damn, another trouble-maker.}
{400}{}{该死，又是麻烦制造者。}
#{401}{}{Damn, another trouble-maker.}
{401}{}{该死，又是麻烦制造者。}
#{402}{}{Damn trouble-maker.}
{402}{}{该死的麻烦制造者。}
#{403}{}{Damn trouble-maker.}
{403}{}{该死的麻烦制造者。}
#{404}{}{This won't end well.}
{404}{}{这不会有好结果的。}
#{405}{}{There always has to be someone stirring shit up.}
{405}{}{总有人在捣乱。}
#{406}{}{Buzz off!}
{406}{}{走开！}
#{407}{}{And I almost thought it was going to be a nice day.}
{407}{}{我差点以为今天会是个好日子。}
#{500}{}{Very well. I almost started to think that midget bastard forgot to tell you to stop by and see me.}
{500}{}{很好。我差点以为那个侏儒混蛋忘了叫你过来看看我。}
#{501}{}{Well, he didn't.}
{501}{}{嗯，他没有。}
#{502}{}{Whuh!}
{502}{}{哇！}
#{550}{}{Great. So as you already know, I'm Tulsa. The commander of this base. I take care things around here go as smoothly as possible. As far as you are concerned, I have no idea how you managed to pull off that thing with the gun, but you've made an impression. A couple of our techies are already looking into it with quite the enthusiasm.}
{550}{}{伟大的。你已经知道了，我是塔尔萨。这个基地的指挥官。我会尽可能地处理好周围的事情。就你而言，我不知道你是怎么用枪把那东西弄下来的，但你给我留下了深刻的印象。我们的几位技术人员已经满怀热情地调查了此事。}
#{551}{}{Great. So as you already know, I'm Tulsa. The commander of this base. I take care things around here go as smoothly as possible. As far as you are concerned, I have no idea how you managed to pull off that thing with the blueprints, but you've made an impression. A couple of our techies are already looking into them with quite the enthusiasm.}
{551}{}{伟大的。你已经知道了，我是塔尔萨。这个基地的指挥官。我会尽可能地处理好周围的事情。就你而言，我不知道你是怎么用蓝图完成的，但你给我留下了深刻的印象。我们的几位技术人员已经非常热情地调查了他们。}
#{552}{}{I'm glad my efforts were not in vain.}
{552}{}{我很高兴我的努力没有白费。}
#{600}{}{Yeah, but let's get back to why you're here. I have two of important things to tell you.}
{600}{}{是的，但让我们回到你来这里的原因。我有两件重要的事要告诉你。}
#{601}{}{Go on.}
{601}{}{继续。}
#{650}{}{Firstly, one place around here you should really pay a visit to is the Wild Paradise, right here in this quarter. Go over there and make yourself comfortable. They got some good booze and perfectly clean girls. But remember, should you cause any trouble to Madam Chow, we'll quickly deal with you, even if you are one of us. A lot of Hunters frequent the place and keep it nice and quite. Is that clear?}
{650}{}{首先，这附近有一个地方你真的应该去看看，那就是野生天堂，就在这一区。去那边舒服点。他们有好酒和干净的女孩。但是请记住，如果你给周女士带来任何麻烦，我们会很快处理你，即使你是我们中的一员。很多猎人经常光顾这个地方，把它保持得又好又安静。明白了吗？}
#{651}{}{Crystal.}
{651}{}{水晶。}
#{652}{}{Not at all. I'm not going to piss my pants because of some whore who happened to open her own brothel.}
{652}{}{一点也不。我不会因为某个妓女碰巧开了自己的妓院而尿裤子。}
#{700}{}{Secondly, as far as the base goes, if you go down the hall, you'll reach a tunnel we dug. Through it, you can get directly to the third floor of Vault 16. I believe that is not something you see everyday, but don't go around spreading the news. Self-centered as the empire is, they believe that the entire floor is flooded by those critters and we would like it to stay that way.}
{700}{}{其次，到了基地，如果你沿着大厅走下去，你会到达我们挖的一条隧道。通过它，你可以直接到达16号金库的三楼。我相信这不是你每天都会看到的事情，但是不要到处散布消息。尽管帝国是以自我为中心的，但他们相信整层楼都被这些生物淹没了，我们希望它保持这种状态。}
#{701}{}{What critters are you talking about?}
{701}{}{你在说什么动物？}
#{702}{}{How is that possible?}
{702}{}{这怎么可能？}
#{703}{}{I got some questions.}
{703}{}{我有一些问题。}
#{704}{}{If that is all, I'll be on my way.}
{704}{}{如果就这些，我就上路了。}
#{750}{}{Oh bugger. There always has to be some idiot to dance out of the line. And I do not like those. Too bad for you.}
{750}{}{哦，该死的。总要有个白痴跳得太离谱。我不喜欢这些。对你来说太糟糕了。}
#{751}{}{We'll see about that.}
{751}{}{我们拭目以待。}
#{800}{}{Great. So as you already know, I'm Tulsa. The commander of this base. I take care things around here go as smoothly as possible. As far as you are concerned, I have no idea how you managed to pull off that thing with the gun, but you've made an impression. A couple of our techies are already looking into it with quite the enthusiasm.}

#{850}{}{Firstly, one place around here you should really pay a visit to is the Wild Paradise, right here in this quarter. Go over there and make yourself comfortable. They got some good booze and perfectly clean girls who do not shy away from other girls. But remember, should you cause any trouble to Madam Chow, we'll quickly deal with you, even if you are one of us. A lot of Hunters frequent the place and keep it nice and quite. Is that clear?}
{850}{}{首先，这附近有一个地方你真的应该去看看，那就是野生天堂，就在这一区。去那边舒服点。他们有一些好酒和干净的女孩谁不回避其他女孩。但是请记住，如果你给周女士带来任何麻烦，我们会很快处理你，即使你是我们中的一员。很多猎人经常光顾这个地方，把它保持得又好又安静。明白了吗？}
#{851}{}{Crystal.}
{851}{}{水晶。}
#{852}{}{Not at all. I'm not going to piss my pants because of some whore who happened to open her own brothel.}
{852}{}{一点也不。我不会因为某个妓女碰巧开了自己的妓院而尿裤子。}
#{900}{}{We just call them aliens. We found two of them in hibernation at a military research facility. They were both queens, probably the brainchildren of some weird biologists trying to create a killer organism. And that is one thing these creatures are. There is not much more our scientists were able to find out, despite what they may have told you. We didn't know what to expect until we woke up the first one. She just so happened to go and kill some eight of our Hunters and took off. God knows where she's causing trouble now. [He laughs.]}
{900}{}{我们管他们叫外星人。我们在一个军事研究机构发现了其中两个在冬眠。他们都是皇后，可能是一些试图创造一个杀手有机体的奇怪生物学家的大脑产物。这些生物就是这样。尽管我们的科学家可能已经告诉你了，但他们能发现的已经不多了。直到第一次醒来，我们才知道会发生什么。她碰巧去杀了我们八个猎人然后就走了。天知道她现在在哪里惹麻烦。[他笑了]}
#{901}{}{What about the second one?}
{901}{}{第二个呢？}
#{950}{}{We were much more careful with her and got her here without letting anyone outside of the Hunters know. It didn't take long for her to start laying eggs with critters just like herself hatching out of them soon. Thankfully, none were queens, just male, natural born killers.}
{950}{}{我们对她更加小心，没有让猎人以外的人知道就把她带到了这里。没过多久，她就开始产卵，像她自己一样的小动物很快就从中孵化出来了。谢天谢地，没有人是女王，只有男性，天生的杀手。}
#{951}{}{What does this have to do with the Vault?}
{951}{}{这跟保险库有什么关系？}
#{952}{}{I wanted to ask something else.}
{952}{}{我想问点别的。}
#{953}{}{Interesting, but I gotta go now.}
{953}{}{有意思，但我得走了。}
#{1000}{}{Oh sure, that is a good story. We dug a tunnel just to the wall of the third floor and as we broke through, we let those critters in first so that it seemed as if they were responsible for it.}
{1000}{}{哦，当然，这是个好故事。我们在三楼的墙上挖了一条隧道，当我们钻进去的时候，我们让那些小动物先进去，这样看起来好像是他们干的。}
#{1001}{}{What happened then?}
{1001}{}{后来发生了什么？}
#{1050}{}{They killed everyone on that floor within a few minutes. You don't see something that amazing every day. And of course, they didn't stop there. Back then, we actually thought they'll clean out the entire Vault. But those morons from the empire eventually managed to stop them on the first floor. From our side, we disabled their access to the third floor. So now, they live on the second floor. Not that it hurts them in any way, Quite to the contrary, they seem to be doing rather well over there.}
{1050}{}{他们几分钟内就把地板上的人都杀了。你不会每天都看到那么神奇的东西。当然，他们并没有就此止步。那时候，我们还以为他们会把整个保险库都清理干净。但帝国的那些白痴最终还是在一楼阻止了他们。从我们这边，我们禁止他们进入三楼。所以现在，他们住在二楼。并不是说这对他们有任何伤害，恰恰相反，他们在那里的表现似乎相当不错。}
#{1051}{}{Neat.}
{1051}{}{整洁。}
#{1100}{}{But the best thing here is that the Emperor has no idea it was all our doing. You know how he reacted? He had the entire Imperial City sealed off. Oh the stupidity! [He laughs.] We gained access to some vault technology and got some additional space for ourselves. And no imperial idiots are going to bother us, without those monsters on the second floor having them for lunch. [He cries with laughter.]}
{1100}{}{但最棒的是皇帝不知道这都是我们干的。你知道他的反应吗？他封锁了整个皇城。哦，愚蠢！[他笑道]我们获得了一些保险库技术，为自己获得了一些额外的空间。没有帝国的白痴会打扰我们，没有那些在二楼的怪物请他们吃午餐。[他笑得直哭。]}
#{1101}{}{How did you make them follow your commands?}
{1101}{}{你是怎么让他们听从你的命令的？}
#{1102}{}{What are those things?}
{1102}{}{那些是什么东西？}
#{1103}{}{I wanted to ask about something else.}
{1103}{}{我想问些别的事。}
#{1104}{}{Interesting, but I gotta go now.}
{1104}{}{有意思，但我得走了。}
#{1150}{}{Oh, we never managed to do that. That is the great bit about it all. They kill indiscriminately. We let them out very carefully so that they could only get into the Vault, not to us and they just moved forward. Thankfully, they didn't spread, but rather they all stuck close to defend the queen, who didn't care for anything.}
{1150}{}{哦，我们从来没做到过。这是最棒的一点。他们滥杀无辜。我们非常小心地把他们放了出来，这样他们只能进入保险库，而不是我们，他们只是向前走。谢天谢地，它们并没有扩散，而是紧紧地站在一起保卫女王，女王什么都不在乎。}
#{1151}{}{What are those things?}
{1151}{}{那些是什么东西？}
#{1152}{}{I wanted to ask about something else.}
{1152}{}{我想问些别的事。}
#{1153}{}{Interesting, but I gotta go now.}
{1153}{}{有意思，但我得走了。}
#{1200}{}{I hope you got some important business to hold me up.}
{1200}{}{我希望你有一些重要的事情耽误我。}
#{1201}{}{I wanted to ask about the Vault.}
{1201}{}{我想问一下金库的事。}
#{1202}{}{What can you tell me about mutants?}
{1202}{}{关于突变体你能告诉我什么？}
#{1203}{}{What can you tell me about Sebastian?}
{1203}{}{关于塞巴斯蒂安你能告诉我什么？}
#{1204}{}{What would you do if there were no more mutants left?}
{1204}{}{如果没有更多的变种人，你会怎么做？}
#{1205}{}{Actually, no.}
{1205}{}{实际上，没有。}
#{1206}{}{Ugh.}
{1206}{}{啊。}
#{1250}{}{Make it worth my time.}
{1250}{}{让它值得我花时间。}
#{1251}{}{I wanted to ask about the Vault.}
{1251}{}{我想问一下金库的事。}
#{1252}{}{What can you tell me about mutants?}
{1252}{}{关于突变体你能告诉我什么？}
#{1253}{}{What can you tell me about Sebastian?}
{1253}{}{关于塞巴斯蒂安你能告诉我什么？}
#{1254}{}{What would you do if there were no more mutants left?}
{1254}{}{如果没有更多的变种人，你会怎么做？}
#{1255}{}{Uh, nothing.}
{1255}{}{呃，没什么。}
#{1300}{}{OK, I'm always amused when I think back to how those monsters swept the third floor clean of any imperial soldiers and we got it for ourselves without the empire knowing. [He laughs.]}
{1300}{}{好吧，当我回想起那些怪物是如何把三楼的帝国士兵扫地出门的，而我们却在帝国不知情的情况下为自己弄来的，我总是觉得好笑。[他笑了]}
#{1301}{}{What are these things?}
{1301}{}{这些是什么东西？}
#{1302}{}{How is that possible?}
{1302}{}{这怎么可能？}
#{1303}{}{I got some other questions.}
{1303}{}{我还有其他问题。}
#{1304}{}{If that is all, I better be going.}
{1304}{}{如果就这些，我最好走了。}
#{1350}{}{Don't go spoiling such a nice day with discussions about those dirty mutants.}
{1350}{}{别讨论那些肮脏的变种人来破坏这么美好的一天。}
#{1351}{}{I wanted to ask about the Vault.}
{1351}{}{我想问一下金库的事。}
#{1352}{}{What can you tell me about Sebastian?}
{1352}{}{关于塞巴斯蒂安你能告诉我什么？}
#{1353}{}{What would you do if there were no more mutants left?}
{1353}{}{如果没有更多的变种人，你会怎么做？}
#{1354}{}{As you wish.}
{1354}{}{如你所愿。}
#{1400}{}{He doesn't take shit from anyone, which is good. But if you ask me, he takes things far too personal. Sometimes, when he gives one of his speeches, I get the impression it'll catch up with him. He should take some time off, perhaps at the Wild Paradise.}
{1400}{}{他不拿任何人的屎，这很好。但如果你问我，他把事情看得太私人了。有时，当他发表演讲时，我觉得他会被吸引住的。他应该休息一段时间，也许在野生天堂。}
#{1401}{}{I wanted to ask about the Vault.}
{1401}{}{我想问一下金库的事。}
#{1402}{}{What can you tell me about mutants?}
{1402}{}{关于突变体你能告诉我什么？}
#{1403}{}{What would you do if there were no more mutants left?}
{1403}{}{如果没有更多的变种人，你会怎么做？}
#{1404}{}{I don't need to know anything more.}
{1404}{}{我不需要知道更多。}
#{1450}{}{There's a rumor going around that he may be dead. It causes nothing but trouble. Sebastian should show up to burry those rumors as soon as possible, before it causes some serious issues.}
{1450}{}{有传言说他可能已经死了。它只会引起麻烦。塞巴斯蒂安应该尽快现身掩盖那些谣言，以免引起一些严重的问题。}
#{1451}{}{I wanted to ask about the Vault.}
{1451}{}{我想问一下金库的事。}
#{1452}{}{What can you tell me about mutants?}
{1452}{}{关于突变体你能告诉我什么？}
#{1453}{}{What would you do if there were no more mutants left?}
{1453}{}{如果没有更多的变种人，你会怎么做？}
#{1454}{}{I don't need to know anything more.}
{1454}{}{我不需要知道更多。}
#{1500}{}{Ha, I don't think I'll live to see that day. I would just go on enjoying my wonderful life, perhaps with even more enthusiasm. [He laughs.]}
{1500}{}{哈，我想我活不到那一天了。我会继续享受我美好的生活，也许会更有热情。[他笑了]}
#{1501}{}{I wanted to ask about the Vault.}
{1501}{}{我想问一下金库的事。}
#{1502}{}{What can you tell me about mutants?}
{1502}{}{关于突变体你能告诉我什么？}
#{1503}{}{What can you tell me about Sebastian?}
{1503}{}{关于塞巴斯蒂安你能告诉我什么？}
#{1504}{}{I don't need to know anything more.}
{1504}{}{我不需要知道更多。}
#{1550}{}{I'm always glad to meet a cute...  Huntress. How can I help you?}
{1550}{}{我总是很高兴见到一个可爱的。。。女猎手。我能帮你什么？}
#{1551}{}{I wanted to ask about the Vault.}
{1551}{}{我想问一下金库的事。}
#{1552}{}{What can you tell me about mutants?}
{1552}{}{关于突变体你能告诉我什么？}
#{1553}{}{What can you tell me about Sebastian?}
{1553}{}{关于塞巴斯蒂安你能告诉我什么？}
#{1554}{}{What would you do if there were no more mutants left?}
{1554}{}{如果没有更多的变种人，你会怎么做？}
#{1555}{}{Actually, nothing.}
{1555}{}{实际上，没什么。}
#{1556}{}{Ugh.}
{1556}{}{啊。}
#{1600}{}{I don't know what it is, but there is something unbelievably sexy about you. I want you. Come here!}
{1600}{}{我不知道是什么，但你身上有种不可思议的性感。我想要你。过来！}
#{1601}{}{[Go with him.]}
{1601}{}{[和他一起去。]}
#{1602}{}{I don't think I want that.}
{1602}{}{我不想那样。}
#{1650}{}{Great. So what was it that you wanted from me?}
{1650}{}{伟大的。你想从我这里得到什么？}
#{1651}{}{I wanted to ask about the Vault.}
{1651}{}{我想问一下金库的事。}
#{1652}{}{What can you tell me about mutants?}
{1652}{}{关于突变体你能告诉我什么？}
#{1653}{}{What can you tell me about Sebastian?}
{1653}{}{关于塞巴斯蒂安你能告诉我什么？}
#{1654}{}{What would you do if there were no more mutants left?}
{1654}{}{如果没有更多的变种人，你会怎么做？}
#{1655}{}{Nothing, really.}
{1655}{}{没什么，真的。}
#{1656}{}{Quite impressive. Girl, you'll do good here. What was it you wanted again?}
{1656}{}{相当令人印象深刻。女孩，你会在这里做得很好的。你又想要什么？}
#{1700}{}{I believe I misheard you. But before you repeat what you just said, you should know that I'm the commander here and you must do anything I ask you to do enthusiastically.}
{1700}{}{我想我听错了。但在你重复刚才说的话之前，你应该知道我是这里的指挥官，你必须热情地做我要求你做的任何事。}
#{1701}{}{I said I gladly go with you.}
{1701}{}{我说我很乐意和你一起去。}
#{1702}{}{I said I'm not going with you and I mean it!}
{1702}{}{我说我不跟你一起去，我是认真的！}
#{1750}{}{Good girl.}
{1750}{}{好姑娘。}
#{1751}{}{[Go with him.]}
{1751}{}{[和他一起去。]}
#{1800}{}{You are still so hot. As you are already here, how about having another go at it?}
{1800}{}{你还是那么性感。既然你已经来了，再来一次怎么样？}
#{1801}{}{[Go with him.]}
{1801}{}{[和他一起去。]}
#{1802}{}{I think I had enough the first time.}
{1802}{}{我想我第一次受够了。}
#{2100}{}{Dammit, what kind of retard did Kraig sent over again?! That tiny bastard must be doing it on purpose. You are done, pal. You got to a place you have no business being at.}
{2100}{}{该死，克莱格又派了什么样的笨蛋来？！那个小混蛋一定是故意的。你完蛋了，伙计。你到了一个你没必要去的地方。}
#{2101}{}{Dammit, what kind of retard did Kraig sent over again?! That tiny bastard must be doing it on purpose. You are done, girl. You got to a place you have no business being at.}
{2101}{}{该死，克莱格又派了什么样的笨蛋来？！那个小混蛋一定是故意的。你完了，姑娘。你去了一个你没必要去的地方。}
#{2102}{}{Uhe?}
{2102}{}{呃？}
#{5000}{}{The empire started to take interest in their Vault again. You better take good care in case those clowns try something stupid.}
{5000}{}{帝国又开始对他们的金库感兴趣了。你最好小心点，以防那些小丑做傻事。}
#{5001}{}{And don't... Hey! That's that lackey of theirs! Dammit, if I don't take care of something, no one will, apparently.}
{5001}{}{别。。。嘿！那是他们的走狗！该死的，如果我不处理什么，显然没人会。}
#{5002}{}{And don't... Hey! That's that lackey bitch of theirs! Dammit, if I don't take care of something, no one will, apparently.}
{5002}{}{别。。。嘿！那是他们的走狗！该死的，如果我不处理什么，显然没人会。}
