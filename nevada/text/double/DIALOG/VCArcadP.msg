{112}{}{[离开] -- [Leave]}
#{113}{}{What? Oh, this arcade machine... [she talks, without getting her attention off the screen] I'm stuck on this level... I tried so many times, but the last boss - it's something special. Always losing on him. But you know, every other game I can beat on the first try. I choose the most difficult ones - and always win. Can you imagine? In such moments, I have this strange feeling... Like when the whole world freezes in time just for you.}
{113}{}{什么？哦，这个街机。。。[她说话，没有把注意力从屏幕上移开]我被困在这个层次上。。。我试过很多次了，但最后一个老板-这很特别。总是输给他。但是你知道，我第一次尝试就能打败的每一场比赛。我选择最难的――而且总是赢。你能想象吗？在这样的时刻，我有一种奇怪的感觉。。。就像整个世界都为你而冻结。 -- What? Oh, this arcade machine... [she talks, without getting her attention off the screen] I'm stuck on this level... I tried so many times, but the last boss - it's something special. Always losing on him.

{114}{}{如果你赢了，那又怎样？你有没有得到一些奖励，比如钱？ -- And if you win, then what? Do you get some reward, like money?}
#{115}{}{No, here you're the one that pays in order to play, not the other way around. It's not like a casino. If you win here, the best you can count on is a bottle of beer from bartender. Like, you know, a token of appreciation.}
{115}{}{不，你是为了比赛才付钱的人，而不是反过来。不像赌场。如果你在这里赢了，你最好指望酒保给你一瓶啤酒。就像，你知道，表示感谢。 -- No, here you're the one that pays in order to play, not the other way around. It's not like a casino. If you win here, the best you can count on is a bottle of beer from bartender. Like, you know, a token of appreciation.}

{116}{}{你在这种机器上玩了多久了？ -- How long have you been playing on such machines?}

{118}{}{对不起，我不是故意的！我不认为在比赛中获胜对你来说那么重要。 -- Sorry, I didn17t mean to! I didn't think it's that important for you, to win at some game.}
#{119}{}{Not my problem, who cares? Maybe I would care more, if winning got you, like, a hundred bucks or something.}
{119}{}{不是我的问题，谁在乎？也许我更在乎，如果赢了你，比如说，一百块钱什么的。 -- Not my problem, who cares? Maybe I would care more, if winning got you, like, a hundred bucks or something.}
#{120}{}{Not your first loss eh? Tell me, why is it so important to you?}
{120}{}{不是你的第一次损失？告诉我，为什么对你这么重要？ -- Not your first loss eh? Tell me, why is it so important to you?}
#{121}{}{Important? Of course, it's important! }
{121}{}{重要吗？当然，这很重要！ -- Important? Of course, it's important! }
#{122}{}{Then why not go play at the casino? Although, I suppose it's different. }
{122}{}{那为什么不去赌场玩呢？不过，我想是不同的。 -- Then why not go play at the casino? Although, I suppose it's different. }

#{124}{}{[Sighs] Oh, I don't know if you would understand... I'm always in control here, right? Avoid, shoot, kill... Everything is simple, I know the rules.

[sights again] It just feels good that, at least for a moment, to grasp that feeling that the world revolves around me. Know what I mean?}
{124}{}{哦，我不知道你会不会明白。。。我总是在这里掌控一切，对吗？躲避，射击，杀戮。。。一切都很简单，我知道规则。当然有时候会很无聊，但总比我住的贫民窟好。还有。。。[又看了一遍]感觉很好，至少在一瞬间，能体会到这个世界围绕着我转的感觉。明白我的意思吗？ -- [Sighs] Oh, I don't know if you would understand... I'm always in control here, right? Avoid, shoot, kill... Everything is simple, I know the rules. Sure it gets boring sometimes, but it's better than the old slums I live in.  And...

#{125}{}{Yeah... I guess. What about that machine over there, is it not working?}
{125}{}{是 啊。。。我想是吧。那边的那台机器怎么样，不工作了吗？ -- Yeah... I guess. What about that machine over there, is it not working?}
#{126}{}{No. It couldn't handle me! I was getting to the tenth level boss on one life, and somehow that fried the board. They all break now and then, usually getting fixed up in a day or so. I guess that one shorted real bad.}
{126}{}{不，它对付不了我！我只靠一次生命就达到了第十级的老板，不知怎的，那就把董事会炸了。他们时不时都会休息，通常一天左右就能修好。我想那只短路了。 -- No. It couldn't handle me! I was getting to the tenth level boss on one life, and somehow that fried the board. They all break now and then, usually getting fixed up in a day or so. I guess that one shorted real bad.}
