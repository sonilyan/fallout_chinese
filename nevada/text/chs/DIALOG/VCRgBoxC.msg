#{100}{}{You see a tired strong man.}
{100}{}{你看到一个疲惫的强壮的男人。}
#{101}{}{You see a man who can no longer stand on his feet from grueling workouts.}
{101}{}{你看到的是一个在艰苦的训练中再也站不起来的人。}
#{110}{}{[You see a weary man, he breathes heavily]}
{110}{}{[你看到一个疲倦的人，他气喘吁吁]}
#{111}{}{Hello!}
{111}{}{你好！}
#{112}{}{Hey, what's wrong with you? Broke in the ring?}
{112}{}{嘿，你怎么了？闯入拳击场？}
#{113}{}{Listen, friend, don't you know how to, uh, sort of prepare for battle without special training? Well, you know, with amphetamines, for example.}
{113}{}{听着，朋友，你不知道如何，呃，不用特殊训练就可以准备战斗吗？嗯，你知道，比如安非他命。}
#{114}{}{[Leave him]}
{114}{}{[离开他]}
#{115}{}{Trainer, a monster, gets off on me. See? My stamina sucks!}
{115}{}{驯兽师，一个怪物，对我下手。看到了吗？我的体力糟透了！}
#{116}{}{Well, you don't look like some nerd. There's some biceps!}
{116}{}{你看起来不像书呆子。有一些二头肌！}
#{117}{}{You too? I also thought that getting buffed is enough! The two years of training! Damn! And no wins!}
{117}{}{你也是？我还以为擦亮就够了！两年的训练！该死！没有胜利！}
#{118}{}{Uh... Not one?!}
{118}{}{休斯敦大学。。。一个都没有？！}
#{119}{}{No stamina, you know? The first round in the ring is mine, and then I'm exhausted.}
{119}{}{没有耐力，你知道吗？拳击场的第一轮是我的，然后我就筋疲力尽了。}
#{120}{}{Oh, so that's what it is.}
{120}{}{哦，原来是这样。}
#{121}{}{And this coach - he's a beast! He tries to pump my endurance. So, I'm always like this after a workout, lay on the mattress, unable to move.}
{121}{}{而这个教练-他是个野兽！他试图激发我的耐力。所以，我锻炼后总是这样，躺在床垫上，动弹不得。}
#{122}{}{And how about amphetamines? Psycho, for example, it could help.}
{122}{}{那安非他命呢？比如说精神病，这可能会有帮助。}
#{123}{}{Let me give you a massage! You'll feel better, you'll see.}
{123}{}{让我给你按摩！你会感觉好些的，你会明白的。}
#{124}{}{Okay. Well, then I'll leave you.}
{124}{}{可以。好吧，那我就离开你。}
#{125}{}{A man to touch me? Hey, hands off!}
{125}{}{一个男人来碰我？嘿，把手拿开！}
#{126}{}{Oh, come on! My thing was to offer...}
{126}{}{哦，来吧！我的任务是提供。。。}
#{127}{}{[Smiling] Wow! Such beauty is going to paw me? Come on, baby! Finally, I get the glory!}
{127}{}{[微笑]哇！这样的美会让我抓狂吗？快点，宝贝！终于，我得到了荣耀！}
#{128}{}{Great! Flip, champion!}
{128}{}{太好了！翻转，冠军！}
#{129}{}{Uh... No. I'll go get... Uh... The ointment first, Yes. Look, just wait.}
{129}{}{休斯敦大学。。。不，我去拿。。。休斯敦大学。。。先吃软膏，是的。听着，等等。}
#{130}{}{Nah! Don't want to! You will torture me worse than the coach with your hands!}
{130}{}{不！我不想！你用手折磨我比折磨教练还厉害！}
#{131}{}{Well, as you wish.}
{131}{}{好吧，如你所愿。}
#{132}{}{Oh! What a thrill!!}
{132}{}{哦！多刺激啊！！}
#{133}{}{You massaged the fighter for an hour. The client is happy!}
{133}{}{你给拳击手按摩了一个小时。客户很高兴！}
#{134}{}{You know, I tried this stuff. The coach rightly says, it is better to push even harder in training than die.}
{134}{}{你知道，我试过这种东西。教练说得对，在训练中更用力地推总比死强。}
#{135}{}{Die?}
{135}{}{死？}
#{136}{}{Ha! And what do you expect?! Got doped and the ring is yours? You know how many of our lads went off from this stuff?}
{136}{}{哈！你还指望什么？！嗑药了戒指是你的？你知道我们有多少人离开了这玩意儿吗？}
#{137}{}{How?}
{137}{}{怎么用？}
#{138}{}{Heart! The heart cannot stand it! It's not so simple, it's still necessary to strain after in the ring or in training. The thing is garbage, don't even think about it.}
{138}{}{心！心受不了！这并不是那么简单，在拳击场上或训练中仍然需要紧张。这东西是垃圾，想都别想。}
#{139}{}{And yet you know where to get the dope, right?}
{139}{}{但你知道从哪里得到毒品，对吗？}
#{140}{}{Fine.}
{140}{}{好的。}
#{141}{}{I don't know! Get off me, you damn junkie! Fuck off! [the eyes of a fighter sparkle with fury, it seems he really doesn't like this conversation]}
{141}{}{我不知道！放开我，你这个该死的瘾君子！滚开！[一个斗士的眼睛里闪着怒火，似乎他真的不喜欢这样的谈话]}
#{142}{}{You know! Tell me!}
{142}{}{你知道的！告诉我！}
#{143}{}{Okay, pal, I'm not straining you. Okay, relax.}
{143}{}{好吧，伙计，我没让你紧张。好的，放松。}
#{144}{}{I'll tell you, just because I see - you're one of us.}
{144}{}{我告诉你，就因为我知道-你是我们中的一员。}
#{145}{}{Come on, I won't tell anyone, be sure.}
{145}{}{拜托，我不会告诉任何人的，确定。}
#{146}{}{There is a large laboratory somewhere outside the city. The Black Caravan, as we call it, goes there every two days. Comes quietly to the parking lot in the shade of the office and pushes drugs, that's how the stuff gets to the city. I used to deal with them, but then gave up, so I don't know, maybe they are already moved to another place.}
{146}{}{城外某处有一个大实验室。我们称之为黑色大篷车，每两天去一次。悄悄来到办公室阴凉处的停车场，推着毒品，这些东西就是这样运到城里的。我曾经和他们打过交道，但是后来放弃了，所以我不知道，也许他们已经搬到另一个地方去了。}
#{147}{}{Okay, thanks for telling me. This is just what I needed.}
{147}{}{好的，谢谢你告诉我。这正是我需要的。}
#{148}{}{Thanks in any other form would be nicer. He-he.}
{148}{}{其他形式的感谢会更好。他，他。}
#{149}{}{Oh yeah, here's 50 bucks for the info.}
{149}{}{哦，是的，这是50美元的信息。}
#{150}{}{Take a beer, relax a little.}
{150}{}{喝杯啤酒，放松一下。}
#{151}{}{Hmm. Well, here's a bottle of cola, for refreshment.}
{151}{}{嗯，这是一瓶可乐，用来提神。}
#{152}{}{Sorry, I have nothing, I'll bring some later.}
{152}{}{对不起，我什么都没有，我等会再带一些来。}
#{153}{}{Um, listen, what do you think, why the slavers tried to frame the freaks?}
{153}{}{嗯，听着，你觉得，为什么奴隶主要陷害这些怪胎？}
#{154}{}{What was that?}
{154}{}{那是什么？}
#{155}{}{Yes, you see, the chief of the Slavertown hired someone to put drugs to the freaks.}
{155}{}{是的，你看，斯拉夫镇的头儿雇了个人给怪胎放毒品。}
#{156}{}{Oh, yeah, that's obvious.}
{156}{}{哦，是的，很明显。}
#{157}{}{Really?}
{157}{}{真的？}
#{158}{}{You bet it is! Don't you understand? The chief wants a percentage of income from the Hoover dam. And the dam is in need of workers. I don't know exactly what the deal is, but I think the chief tries to push his slaves to the dam. Bob Neil, obviously, doesn't like that, and looks for alternatives. So, chief must've decided that the freaks should be dealt with, so the dam owner had no other choice than to accept slaves to work. Otherwise, no money for him.}
{158}{}{当然是的！你不明白吗？酋长希望从胡佛大坝获得一定比例的收入。大坝需要工人。我不知道具体的交易是什么，但我认为酋长试图把他的奴隶推到大坝上去。显然，鲍勃・尼尔不喜欢这样，他在寻找替代品。所以，酋长一定决定要处理这些怪胎，所以大坝的主人除了接受奴隶工作别无选择。否则，他就没钱了。}
#{159}{}{Where they got the dope, don't you know?}
{159}{}{他们从哪儿弄来的毒品，你不知道吗？}
#{160}{}{Hmm. Interesting thought. I'll take note of that.}
{160}{}{嗯。有趣的想法。我会注意到的。}
#{161}{}{Ah, so that's what it is about! Why didn't you tell that first. Why start with Bob Neil anyway?}
{161}{}{啊，原来是这样的！你为什么不先说呢。为什么要从鲍勃・尼尔开始呢？}
#{162}{}{No reason... Well, to hell with them. So how about amphetamines?}
{162}{}{没有理由。。。好吧，让他们见鬼去吧。那安非他命呢？}
