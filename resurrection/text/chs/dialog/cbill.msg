#{650}{}{It's full of shit. The pay's lousy, and working conditions dreadful. To feed myself and my woman, I have to bust my ass here from dawn to dusk like a slave.}
{650}{}{全是狗屎。工资很低，工作条件也很糟糕。为了养活我自己和我的女人，我必须像个奴隶一样从早到晚在这里拼命工作。}

#{652}{}{I'm not gonna interrupt you then.}
{652}{}{我不会打断你的。}
#{700}{}{What's it to ya? You're not trying to woo her away from me, are you?}
{700}{}{跟你有什么关系？你不是想把她从我身边拉走吧？}
#{701}{}{Are you aware that Wanda would like to hire her? She could earn both of you some extra cash.}
{701}{}{你知道旺达想雇用她吗？她可以为你们俩多挣点钱。}
#{702}{}{It's time you knew: I've been screwing her for a long time now. We're fond of each other, and Valery's decided to leave you.}
{702}{}{是时候让你知道了：我已经和她上床很久了。我们彼此相爱，瓦莱里决定离开你。}

{703}{}{不，我不是，但你可以离开她。比如说，500个瓶盖。}
#{704}{}{Oh no, forget about it.}
{704}{}{哦不，算了吧。}
#{750}{}{What?! She was opening her legs for you while I was working in here like a brahmin?! That bitch is mine and I won't give her up. I challenge you to the ring! Once I've killed you, I'll think of a proper punishment for her.}
{750}{}{什么？！当我像双头牛一样在这里工作时，她在为你张开双腿？！那婊子是我的，我不会放弃她。我向你挑战擂台！一旦我杀了你，我会想办法好好惩罚她。}

{850}{}{什么？你到底在说什么？}
#{851}{}{I'll give you 500 caps, if you leave Corath without Valery and never come back. Don't tell me that you care about her so much. For five hundred you can bang some hookers in Sedit, and if you want, you can help with the caravans. It's easier than mining, better paying.}
{851}{}{如果你不带瓦莱里离开科拉斯再也不回来，我就给你500顶瓶盖。别告诉我你这么关心她。花500美元你可以在塞迪特和一些妓女搭讪，如果你愿意，你可以帮着搭讪。这比采矿容易，报酬更高。}
#{852}{}{Oh nothing really, forget it.}
{852}{}{哦，没什么，算了吧。}
#{900}{}{To be honest she has been getting on my nerves lately. Let that cow take care of herself for once. Gimme those caps, so I can show my back to this mine, to her, and this whole goddamned place.}
{900}{}{说实话，她最近让我很紧张。让那头牛好好照顾一下自己。把瓶盖给我，这样我就可以背对着我的，背对着她，背对着整个该死的地方。}
#{901}{}{Here you go. [Give him 500 caps.]}
{901}{}{干得好。[给他500个瓶盖]}
#{950}{}{What? Can I have a peaceful moment for once?}

#{952}{}{Oh, sorry.}
{952}{}{哦，对不起。}
#{953}{}{Babubu.}
{953}{}{巴布。}
#{1000}{}{Leave me alone.}
{1000}{}{别管我。}
#{1001}{}{Bhaa.}
{1001}{}{博阿。}
#{1002}{}{Arrrrrrgh!}
{1002}{}{啊，啊！}
#{1050}{}{As you can see, I'm a miner, even though I'm not working right now due to the strike. My name's Bill.}

#{1054}{}{Take care, Bill.}

#{1102}{}{Good luck then, farewell.}
{1102}{}{祝你好运，再见。}
#{1150}{}{What now? When I'm not working I want to have at least a moment of peace.}
{1150}{}{现在怎么办？当我不工作的时候，我想至少有片刻的平静。}
#{1151}{}{Why are the miners striking?}
{1151}{}{为什么矿工罢工？}
#{1152}{}{Is Valery your wife?}

#{1154}{}{Oh sorry then, I won't bother you.}
{1154}{}{哦，对不起，我不会打扰你的。}
#{1155}{}{Babubu.}
{1155}{}{巴布。}
#{1200}{}{Valery must've lost her mind! I don't know how I'm gonna take care of them both. Well... I can try, but Abby needs to be just as nice to me as Valery is. [He scratches his crotch.]}
{1200}{}{瓦莱里一定是疯了！我不知道该怎么照顾他们两个。好。。。我可以试试，但是艾比需要像瓦莱里一样对我好。[他搔了搔胯部。]}

#{1251}{}{What happened?}
{1251}{}{怎么搞的？}
#{1252}{}{Sorry then.}
{1252}{}{对不起。}
#{1253}{}{Uff.}
{1253}{}{不明飞行物。}
#{1300}{}{My woman dumped me! She decided to work as a whore. But I'm not gonna leave it at that. I'll sacrifice the unreasonable amount that is her asking price and I'll make her regret her stupid decision.}
{1300}{}{我的女人甩了我！她决定当妓女。但我不会就此罢休。我会牺牲她要价的不合理金额，我会让她后悔她愚蠢的决定。}
#{1301}{}{As you wish, goodbye.}
{1301}{}{如你所愿，再见。}
#{1350}{}{Leave me alone, I'm angry.}
{1350}{}{别管我，我很生气。}
#{1351}{}{What happened?}
{1351}{}{怎么搞的？}
#{1352}{}{Sorry then.}
{1352}{}{对不起。}
#{1353}{}{Uff.}
{1353}{}{不明飞行物。}
#{1400}{}{Uncle took over the mines and that's about it. I doubt anything will change anyway.}
{1400}{}{叔叔接管了矿山，就这样。不管怎样，我怀疑一切都会改变。}
#{1401}{}{I see.}
{1401}{}{我懂了。}
#{1450}{}{What? You still have the nerve to show your face around here?! I'd kill you in the ring, if you weren't such a coward, making a woman fight in your stead. Piss off and stay away from Valery, you scum.}
{1450}{}{什么？你还敢在这里露脸？！如果你不是一个胆小鬼，让一个女人代替你打架，我会在拳击场上杀了你。滚开，离瓦莱里远点，你这个人渣。}
#{1451}{}{What? You still have the nerve to show your face around here?! I'd kill you in the ring, if you weren't such a coward, making someone else fight in your stead. Piss off and stay away from Valery, you scum.}
{1451}{}{什么？你还敢在这里露脸？！如果你不是个胆小鬼，让别人替你打架，我会在拳击场上杀了你。滚开，离瓦莱里远点，你这个人渣。}
#{1452}{}{You... No, I'm not even gonna deal with you.}
{1452}{}{你。。。不，我甚至不打算和你打交道。}
#{1453}{}{Bastard, I'm going to kill you!}
{1453}{}{混蛋，我要杀了你！}
#{1454}{}{Uff.}
{1454}{}{不明飞行物。}
#{1455}{}{Graaaa!}
{1455}{}{好极了！}
