{235}{}{绝对不是。没有订单，我只能把剩余的卖给兄弟会的员工。}
### {236}{}{Sorry. Apparently, there's nothing you can do about it.}
{236}{}{很抱歉显然，你对此无能为力。}

### {243}{}{Wow, that was good. You can't buy much on my salary. The main thing is that no one finds out.}
{243}{}{哇，太好了。你用我的工资买不了多少。最重要的是没有人发现。}

{257}{}{我正在服刑。我错过了上午的训练，因为我整个上午都在找中士。}
### {258}{}{Of course. Who will put a good soldier in the kitchen.}
{258}{}{当然谁会把一个好士兵放进厨房。}
### {259}{}{Are you kidding me? I wanted to ask for a shore leave, so I was looking for the sergeant all morning, but he was nowhere to be found.}

### {261}{}{I need to rest. I was on leave a hundred years ago.}
{261}{}{我需要休息。一百年前我休假了。}
### {262}{}{What an injustice. So it's not even your fault that you got into this mess?}
{262}{}{多么不公正啊。所以你陷入这种混乱甚至不是你的错？}
### {263}{}{Exactly. I urgently need a shore leave, but no one could sign the petition. So I ran all over the ship.}
{263}{}{确切地我急需休假，但没有人能在请愿书上签字。所以我跑遍了整艘船。}
### {264}{}{What if I ask for a leave of absence for you? What will I get for it?}
{264}{}{如果我为你请假怎么办？我能得到什么？}
### {265}{}{Can you? Oh, I'll pay with provisions then. Or I'll share my cartridges.}
{265}{}{你能吗？哦，那我就用粮食来支付。或者我会分享我的墨盒。}
### {266}{}{It's been noticed. Consider the order already in your pocket.}
{266}{}{它已经被注意到了。考虑一下已经在你口袋里的订单。}
### {267}{}{And the truth is, I have neither connections nor authority. It's unlikely to work.}
{267}{}{事实是，我既没有关系，也没有权威。这不太可能奏效。}
### {268}{}{I can get an order for you. Or at least I'll try.}
{268}{}{我可以帮你订一份。或者至少我会试试。}
### {269}{}{Can you? You are my last hope.}
{269}{}{你能吗？你是我最后的希望。}

{275}{}{你为什么需要休假？周围除了沙漠什么都没有。}
### {276}{}{No, there is a settlement of Casa Nueva in the west. Our people are on patrol there and sometimes rest. Nice place, lots of people, fresh air. Not like this rusty vessel. At noon it's so stuffy here that you walk around in your underpants.}
{276}{}{不，在西部有一个努瓦之家的定居点。我们的人在那里巡逻，有时休息。好地方，人多，空气新鲜。不像这艘生锈的船。中午的时候，这里太闷了，你穿着内裤到处走。}

### {279}{}{But HOW can I get you a furlough?}
{279}{}{但是我怎样才能让你休假呢？}
### {280}{}{But why would you go to a deserted beach?}
{280}{}{但你为什么要去一个荒芜的海滩？}
### {281}{}{I would have known, I would have begged for it long ago. In general, such orders can only be signed by higher ranks. And you can also get an order for a task from one of the divisions. But inexperienced people like me don't like to be sent on free assignments. How to carry heavy things is always welcome. And as soon as the orders are taken to the camp, half of the squad gets in line.}
{281}{}{我早就知道了，我早就乞求了。一般来说，这种命令只能由更高级别的人签署。您还可以从其中一个部门获得任务订单。但像我这样缺乏经验的人不喜欢被派去做免费任务。如何搬运重物总是受欢迎的。一旦命令被送到营地，一半的队员就会排队。}
### {282}{}{The order has been issued. You're free for the next four days.}
{282}{}{命令已经发布。接下来的四天你有空。}
### {283}{}{Wow, that's news! Are you serious?}

{284}{}{这是真的。帮助别人是我的快乐。}
### {285}{}{What kind of jokes? I'm serious. But you have to pay for everything.}
{285}{}{什么样的笑话？我是认真的。但你必须为一切付出代价。}
### {286}{}{But I'll need caps on the shore. Let me share the bullets? These armor-piercing ones have never been useful to me anyway.}
{286}{}{但我需要岸上的瓶盖。让我分享子弹？无论如何，这些穿甲的对我来说从来都没用过。}
### {287}{}{Great, I'll find a use for them.}
{287}{}{太好了，我会找到它们的用处。}
### {288}{}{Thank you. I'll go to the sergeant, let him burst with envy.}
{288}{}{非常感谢。我要去找中士，让他嫉妒得暴跳如雷。}
### {289}{}{Come on, have a good trip.}
{289}{}{来吧，祝你旅途愉快。}

{304}{}{这就是为什么这里的每个人看起来都不开心的原因吗？}
