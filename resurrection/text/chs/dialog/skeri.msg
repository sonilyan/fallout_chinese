#{851}{}{Heey! I'm still here! What's going on?}
{851}{}{嘿！我还在这里！发生什么事？}
#{900}{}{Sorry, but that SENILE OLD MAN still hasn't got the memo that I don't work here anymore.}
{900}{}{对不起，那个老家伙还没有我不在这里工作的备忘录。}

#{1002}{}{I see, I'm going to look for him.}
{1002}{}{我明白了，我要去找他。}
#{1050}{}{I just feel that nothing matters anymore! I worked pretty hard for the Crimson Caravan while at the Hub, everything was going so nicely but eventually ended in ashes anyway.}
{1050}{}{我只是觉得什么都不重要了！我在中心为深红色大篷车努力工作，一切都很顺利，但最终还是化为乌有。}
#{1051}{}{Sorry to hear that.}
{1051}{}{很抱歉听到这个消息。}
#{1052}{}{What happened?}

#{1053}{}{I don't really care about that, I'm leaving.}
{1053}{}{我才不管呢，我要走了。}
#{1100}{}{Mutants. Fucking supermutants! When Master was killed, they became uncontrollable. Maybe it was a good thing for the world but certainly a terrible thing for the Hub, which was leveled by a whole bunch of them.}
{1100}{}{变种人。他妈的超级毛驴！师父被杀后，他们变得无法控制。也许这对世界来说是件好事，但对被一大群人夷为平地的枢纽来说无疑是件可怕的事。}
#{1101}{}{That's terrible! Sorry to hear that.}
{1101}{}{太可怕了！很抱歉听到这个消息。}

#{1103}{}{Sad. See you around.}
{1103}{}{悲伤。回头见。}
#{1150}{}{Yes, it's going great. It's obvious that they can do without me. I don't wanna do the same thing again and again, I want some change, some action!}
{1150}{}{是的，很好。很明显，他们没有我也可以。我不想一次又一次地做同样的事情，我想要一些改变，一些行动！}
#{1151}{}{So what are you going to do then?}
{1151}{}{那你打算怎么办？}
#{1152}{}{I hope you will find your action. Bye.}

{1201}{}{那你打算怎么办？}
#{1202}{}{So long.}
{1202}{}{这么久。}
#{1250}{}{I don't even know myself, I need to get the hell out of here and finally experience some real action. I can't live with the old bastard anymore. I'd probably end up blown to bits by a bomb left at the toilet sooner or later anyway.}
{1250}{}{我甚至不了解自己，我需要离开这里，最终体验一些真实的行动。我不能再和那个老混蛋住在一起了。我迟早会被留在厕所的炸弹炸成碎片的。}
#{1251}{}{What?}
{1251}{}{什么？}
#{1252}{}{Come with me, then! Sometimes there's too much action for one to handle.}
{1252}{}{那就跟我来！有时候有太多的事情要处理。}
#{1253}{}{And I just wanted to go take a leak. I better get out of here fast.}
{1253}{}{我只是想出去走走。我最好快点离开这里。}
#{1254}{}{And I just wanted to go take a leak. I better get out of here fast.}
{1254}{}{我只是想出去走走。我最好快点离开这里。}
#{1300}{}{He's more and more dangerous! He's always tinkering with those explosives of his, arming them and letting them blow! He probably has a loose screw, destruction of the Hub has ruined him more than you can imagine. No wonder though, even I would love to kick the world in the ass, provided I knew where the world's butt is.}
{1300}{}{他越来越危险了！他总是摆弄他的炸药，武装他们，让他们爆炸！他可能有一个松动的螺丝，破坏了枢纽毁了他比你能想象的。难怪，如果我知道世界的屁股在哪里，我也会很想踢这个世界的屁股。}
#{1301}{}{Well come with me then! We'll find and kick the world's ass together and I can guarantee that there will be enough shit to go through.}
{1301}{}{那就跟我来吧！我们会找到并一起踢世界的屁股，我可以保证会有足够的狗屎经历。}
#{1302}{}{I better clear off before something bad happens to me too.}
{1302}{}{我最好在不好的事情发生之前离开。}
#{1350}{}{What kind of action do you have in mind?}
{1350}{}{你想采取什么样的行动？}
#{1351}{}{I've lost my memory. There's a group of ghouls trying to kill me, but they wear a strange talisman that's the only lead back to my memory. Not to mention common muggings, assaults and rats that want to eat me for dinner.}
{1351}{}{我失忆了。有一群僵尸想杀我，但他们戴着一个奇怪的护身符，这是我记忆中唯一的线索。更不用说普通的抢劫，袭击和老鼠想把我当晚餐吃。}

{1353}{}{性狂欢，到处和任何人勾搭。你不会错过的！}
#{1400}{}{Hell, that's what I call an action! Count me in so we can be off.}
{1400}{}{Hell, that's what I call an action! Count me in so we can be off.}
#{1401}{}{Let's go.}
{1401}{}{走吧。}
#{1450}{}{Sounds great to me. Let us be off then!}
{1450}{}{听起来不错。那我们走吧！}
#{1451}{}{Let's go.}
{1451}{}{走吧。}
#{1500}{}{You have a big enough group already, there wouldn't be enough action for me.}

{1600}{}{真正地？！那样的话，滚开，没兴趣！}
#{1601}{}{You don't know what you are passing, your bad.}
{1601}{}{你不知道你在传递什么，你的坏。}
#{1650}{}{I better go on my own, I wouldn't be able to stand you for a long time.}
{1650}{}{我最好自己去，我受不了你太久了。}
#{1651}{}{That's okay, the same goes for me.}
{1651}{}{没关系，我也是。}
#{1700}{}{I can say anything I want about him! Mind your own fucking business!}
{1700}{}{我想说什么就说什么！管好你自己的事！}
#{1701}{}{People should be nicer to each other, the world would be a much better place.}

#{1752}{}{I'm leaving.}
{1752}{}{我要走了。}
#{1800}{}{Okay, relax. If you keep talking shit like this, I'm going to kick you in the nuts. Find Johny, he's been doing my job since I've stopped. Demetre still doesn't get it.}
{1800}{}{好的，放松。如果你再这样胡说八道，我就要揍你一顿。找到约翰尼，自从我停下来他就一直在做我的工作。德米特里还是不明白。}

#{1802}{}{OK, I will find him.}
{1802}{}{好的，我会找到他的。}
