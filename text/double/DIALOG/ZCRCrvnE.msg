#{111}{}{You're welcome.}
{111}{}{不客气。 -- You're welcome.}
#{112}{}{Hey, listen. We're gonna stick around for a little while, then head back to Reno. You're welcome to join us, if you're interested - always good to have an extra gun. You'll have to travel light though, we carry enough extra weight as it is.}
{112}{}{嘿，听着。我们要呆一会儿，然后回雷诺。如果你有兴趣的话，欢迎你加入我们-多带一把枪总是好的。不过你得轻装上阵，因为我们有足够的额外重量。 -- Hey, listen. We're gonna stick around for a little while, then head back to Reno.

#{126}{}{Gecko skins, that's why! Can't keep wearing pre-war clothing forever, you know. It's time for Nevada to update its wardrobe, and this year it's leather, leather, leather. It's a good time to be a gecko hunter, especially if you can take on the golden ones.}
{126}{}{壁虎皮，这就是原因！你知道，不能一直穿着战前的衣服。内华达是时候更新它的衣柜了，今年是皮革，皮革，皮革。现在是做壁虎猎人的好时机，尤其是如果你能和黄金壁虎对决的话。 -- Gecko skins, that's why! Can't keep wearing pre-war clothing forever, you know.

#{127}{}{We were coming up from Reno to pick up some gecko skins. Coming up on the mountains, something didn't feel right.

Clever me, huh?}
{127}{}{我们从里诺过来取些壁虎皮。到了山上，感觉有些不对劲。我们拿出望远镜去发现，瞧，袭击者连营火都没熄灭。纯粹的业余时间，我对自己说。幸运的是，我知道一个山洞正好穿过山的一侧。我们只要带着商队穿过它，从另一边出去，袭击者根本不知道我们在那里。聪明的我，哈？ -- We were coming up from Reno to pick up some gecko skins.

#{128}{}{What next?}
{128}{}{接下来呢？ -- What next?}
#{129}{}{Turns out they knew about the cave too. Fuck, I walked right into it! Just after we passed through, they detonated the cave behind us and sealed off the tunnel. I don't know if they planned it that way, or just got lucky, but it doesn't really matter now.}
{129}{}{原来他们也知道那个洞。妈的，我直接就进去了！我们刚通过，他们就引爆了我们身后的山洞，封锁了隧道。我不知道他们是这样计划的，还是运气好，但现在已经不重要了。 -- Turns out they knew about the cave too. Fuck, I walked right into it!

#{130}{}{You seem like a decent man. Why not? But you better travel light - no more than 35 pounds. Anything more than that and you'll slow us down. We're going to Reno, but I can drop you at Lovelock if you want. Ready to go?}
