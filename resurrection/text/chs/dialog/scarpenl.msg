#{1253}{}{I've been needing this for a long time. I've never had sex THIS good, not even with my husband, way back when he used to care for me.

{1253}{}{我需要这个很久了。我从来没有过这么好的性生活，即使是和我丈夫，在他以前照顾我的时候。[她把声音降低到耳语]我不敢相信我愿意做我刚刚和你一起做的事。我想我一想到它就会脸红。[她一直微笑着。]}

#{1450}{}{I have a feeling that this is more about the necklace than about me. You'll have to remember me without it.}

#{1702}{}{Goodbye.}
{1702}{}{再见。}
#{1720}{}{That's nice. [She smiled lightly.] You didn't do anything wrong, I just felt bad for cheating on my husband, no matter what he's like. I won't burden you with my problems, I realize you don't want to hear about my husband. [She made a gesture for you to follow her.] I accept your offer.}
{1720}{}{那很好。[她淡淡地笑了笑]你没有做错什么，我只是为背叛我丈夫感到难过，不管他是什么样的人。我不会用我的问题来加重你的负担，我知道你不想听我丈夫的事。我接受你的提议。}
#{1721}{}{[Go with her.]}
{1721}{}{[和她一起去。]}
#{1750}{}{There's nothing like proper sex.}
{1750}{}{没有什么比正常的性生活更好的了。}
#{1751}{}{It was amazing. I'm starting to regret it's just one night. Could you give me something that will always remind me of you? How about that necklace you were wearing?}
