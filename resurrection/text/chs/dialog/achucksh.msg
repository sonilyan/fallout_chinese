That's why he sent us here, but there was only Chuck...}

{751}{}{现在一切都结束了。你能从这里出去吗？？}
#{800}{}{Yes. I think we'll manage. Somehow. We'll go home... Home. I never thought I'd ever leave this place... But first, we'll go to colonel Parson. I'll tell him what was going on here. I don't want to remember. I don't want to talk about it. But he must know what kind of a monster Browman is. What that bastard did to us... And that he also used to come here, and...}
{800}{}{是的。我想我们能搞定。在某种程度上。我们要回家…家。我从没想过我会离开这个地方…但首先，我们要去找帕森上校。我会告诉他这里发生了什么。我不想记住，也不想谈这个。但他一定要知道勃劳曼是个什么的怪物。那个混蛋对我们做了什么…他也经常来这里，还有…}
