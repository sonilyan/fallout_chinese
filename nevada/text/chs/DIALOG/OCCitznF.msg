#{100}{}{You see a villager.}

#{101}{}{You see a very sad woman.}

#{102}{}{I can??t watch this...}

#{103}{}{I'm not coming out until it's over.}
{103}{}{不结束我是不会出来的。}
#{104}{}{Run! As far as you can! They're all crazy!}
{104}{}{快跑！尽你所能！他们都疯了！}
#{105}{}{How can they do this?}
{105}{}{他们怎么能这么做？}
#{110}{}{You... You're not from Black Rock, are you?}
{110}{}{你...你不是黑岩人吧？}
#{111}{}{No. Can we chat anyway?}
{111}{}{不，我们能聊聊吗？}
#{112}{}{[She sadly sighs] I'm sorry. I'm not up to talking right now. Maybe someone else can help you...}
{112}{}{[她悲伤地叹息]对不起。我现在不能说话。也许其他人可以帮你...}
#{113}{}{That's probably a good idea.}

#{118}{}{Okay.}
{118}{}{可以。}
#{119}{}{No worries, I just came from there. Are you Milo's wife?}

#{122}{}{This will be hard to hear, but... Your husband is dead. He's buried in Black Rock cemetery.}
{122}{}{这很难听，但是...你丈夫死了。他葬在黑岩公墓。}
#{123}{}{He's at peace, and in a better place. Specifically, a nice quiet grave where he doesn't have to listen to your whining and moaning anymore. I bet the gravedigger in Black Rock gave him a better fuck than you ever did, too.}
{123}{}{他很平静，在一个更好的地方。特别是，一个安静的坟墓，他不必再听你的抱怨和呻吟了。我打赌黑岩的掘墓人也比你干得好。}
#{124}{}{No, I don't know anything! Calm down!}
{124}{}{不，我什么都不知道！冷静！}
#{125}{}{Oh, Milo... No one have seen him since he took those damn pelts to Black Rock! Neither here, nor there! He couldn't just disappear in the middle of the desert, could he?! I miss him so much...}
{125}{}{哦，麦洛...自从他把那些该死的毛皮带到黑岩后就没人见过他！不在这里，也不在那里！他不可能在沙漠中消失，是吗？！我很想念他...}

{126}{}{他走之前在干什么？}
#{127}{}{How did he look when he left?}
{127}{}{他走的时候看起来怎么样？}
#{128}{}{Nothing unusual... But wait a second. The day before he left, some young man I've never seen before came to see him. He had a leather jacket and looked scruffy, like some New Reno thug. I don't know what they talked about, but Milo kicked him out pretty quickly.}
{128}{}{没什么不寻常的...但是等一下。在他离开的前一天，一个我从未见过的年轻人来看他。他穿着一件皮夹克，看上去邋遢不堪，像个新来的雷诺暴徒。我不知道他们在说什么，但米洛很快就把他赶了出去。}
#{129}{}{Brown hair, very tanned, average height for a man... Oh, but he had his good leather boots! Milo always said that if you walk for a living, you need good boots. He made them himself, from brahmin leather. They have a star on the sole and a knife sheath on the right boot. I still remember watching him make them... He has such beautiful hands...}
{129}{}{棕色头发，晒黑，男人的平均身高...哦，但他有一双好皮靴！米洛总是说，如果你以走路为生，你需要一双好靴子。他自己用双头牛皮革做的。鞋底上有一颗星星，右靴子上有一个刀鞘。我还记得看着他做的...他有一双漂亮的手...}
#{130}{}{So Milo had an argument with a young punk before leaving to Black Rock, while wearing his leather boots with a star on the sole. I should remember that.}
{130}{}{所以米洛在去黑岩之前和一个年轻的朋克吵了一架，当时他穿着一双鞋底有星星的皮靴。我应该记得。}
#{131}{}{Th-thank you... [she starts to sob] ...now I know...}
{131}{}{谢谢你...[她开始抽泣]…现在我知道了...}
#{132}{}{I'll leave you alone.}
{132}{}{我不打扰你了。}
#{133}{}{[She recoils as if struck, then starts to cry] You - you *monster*! GET OUT!}

#{135}{}{Please, leave me. We have nothing more to talk about anyway.}
{135}{}{拜托，离开我。反正我们没什么可谈的了。}
#{136}{}{Oh, it's you again.}
{136}{}{哦，又是你。}
#{137}{}{Can I ask you some questions about Milo?}
{137}{}{我能问你一些关于米洛的问题吗？}
#{138}{}{Something wrong?}
{138}{}{出什么事了？}
#{139}{}{I think we should stop here.}
{139}{}{我想我们应该到此为止。}
#{140}{}{That helps explain things.}

#{141}{}{Aww, boo hoo. Lucky Milo, at least he doesn't have to deal with this anymore.}
{141}{}{啊，呜呜。幸运的米洛，至少他不用再处理这些了。}
