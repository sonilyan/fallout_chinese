#{100}{}{You see a trapper of lizards.}
{100}{}{你看到一个蜥蜴捕猎者。}
#{101}{}{You see a tanned to the point of blackness desert lizards trapper. He must be long engaged in his art.}
{101}{}{你看到一个晒到黑的沙漠蜥蜴捕兽器。他一定长期从事艺术。}
#{110}{}{(Approaching the fire you notice a tanned man, dressed in leather. At first glance he looks like a retard, as if waiting for something to instantly grab. Seeing you, he only looks around with curiosity)}
{110}{}{（走近火堆时，你注意到一个晒得黝黑的人，穿着皮衣。乍一看他像个白痴，好像在等什么东西能马上抓住似的。看到你，他只是好奇地环顾四周）}
#{111}{}{May I?}
{111}{}{我可以吗？}
#{112}{}{I don't mind... [his voice seems dull and stiff, like in his life this man rarely had to communicate with people] You must have a good reason to wander through these barren lands.}
{112}{}{我不介意...[他的声音似乎沉闷而僵硬，就像他一生中很少与人交流]你一定有充分的理由在这些贫瘠的土地上漫步。}
#{113}{}{Yeah, I had to go on a long journey... But, judging by the look of your inventory, this land is not so barren.}
{113}{}{是啊，我得走很长的路...但是，从你的库存来看，这片土地并没有那么贫瘠。}
#{114}{}{[Frowns a little] You can stop looking, there are only desert lizards. My catch of the day.}
{114}{}{你别再看了，这里只有沙漠蜥蜴。我今天的收获。}
#{115}{}{So you're a lizard trapper?}
{115}{}{所以你是蜥蜴捕手？}
#{116}{}{Well, yes. I've been doing this for half of my life. I can??t really do anything else.}
{116}{}{嗯，是的。我已经做了半辈子了。我真的什么也做不了。}
#{117}{}{Are there other people around here, besides you?}
{117}{}{除了你，这附近还有其他人吗？}
#{118}{}{And what kind of lizards?}
{118}{}{什么样的蜥蜴？}
#{119}{}{You must be doing a great job, surviving in the wastes.}
{119}{}{你一定做得很好，在荒野中生存。}
#{120}{}{Yes. I was destined to dwell the wasteland. I don??t like being around people. Here I have all I need.}
{120}{}{对。我注定要住在荒地里。我不喜欢和人在一起。这是我所需要的一切。}
#{121}{}{Well, uh, it was an interesting conversation, but I gotta go my way now. Farewell.}
{121}{}{嗯，呃，这是一次有趣的谈话，但我现在得走我的路了。再会。}
#{122}{}{Yeah. There are a couple of small settlements nearby. To the south, they say, there are more, but I didn't go there. To the east is the peace and quiet. Rarely you meet settlers there.}
{122}{}{是 啊。附近有几个小定居点。到了南方，他们说，有更多，但我没有去那里。东方是和平与宁静。在那里你很少见到定居者。}
#{123}{}{Can you show me how to reach them?}
{123}{}{你能告诉我怎么联系他们吗？}
#{124}{}{[Draws in the sand] Here is the Black Rock, and there's a community of Gerlach. As for me, I prefer the desert than to live there.}
{124}{}{这里是黑岩，还有一个Gerlach社区。对我来说，我更喜欢沙漠而不是住在那里。}
#{125}{}{Iguanas - desert lizards. Crawling here and there. You catch them and put them on fire. Nothing more to do.}
{125}{}{鬣蜥-沙漠蜥蜴。到处爬。你抓住他们，把他们放在火上。没什么可做的了。}
#{126}{}{Can you make some iguanas for me?}
{126}{}{你能给我做些鬣蜥吗？}
#{127}{}{Well, yes. And what will you give me for it?}
{127}{}{嗯，是的。你会给我什么？}
#{128}{}{Actually, I don't know... Let's see what we can trade.}
{128}{}{实际上，我不知道...让我们看看我们能做什么交易。}
#{129}{}{Hey, tell me better how to cook them. It would be useful in my journey!}
{129}{}{嘿，告诉我怎么做更好。在我的旅途中会有用的！}
#{130}{}{You know, I'd better look for other food.}
{130}{}{你知道，我最好找点别的吃的。}
#{131}{}{It's easy. Bring me some water, or money - and I'll teach.}
{131}{}{这很简单。给我一些水，或者钱，我来教你。}
#{132}{}{Yeah.}
{132}{}{是 啊。}
#{133}{}{Here's $50.}
{133}{}{这是50美元。}
#{134}{}{Here is a flask of clean water.}
{134}{}{这是一瓶清水。}
#{135}{}{Oh, come on! Two good people will be able to understand each other, aren't they?}
{135}{}{哦，来吧！两个好人会互相理解的，不是吗？}
#{136}{}{Then you'll *have* to tell, otherwise you won??t leave this desert alive.}
{136}{}{那你就得说出来，否则你就活不下去了。}
#{137}{}{[Slowly turns his head] Nah, that won't work.}
{137}{}{[慢慢转过头]不，那不行。}
#{138}{}{[With pouty lips, his face doesn't look so evil, more as childish] Yes, I'll tell... Ugh...}
{138}{}{[撅着嘴，他的脸看起来没那么邪恶，更像是孩子气]是的，我会告诉你...呃...}
#{139}{}{[Next]}
{139}{}{[下一步]}
#{140}{}{[Trapper taught you how to make kebabs from the iguanas] ...And, most importantly, don??t forget to remove this part, otherwise - hold on to your stomach.}
{140}{}{[Trapper教你如何用鬣蜥做烤肉串]…最重要的是，别忘了把这部分去掉，否则-抓住你的胃。}
#{141}{}{Heh, it turns out, it??s not so simple. Well, thank you, hunter, you helped me a lot.}
{141}{}{呵呵，原来，没那么简单。嗯，谢谢你，亨特，你帮了我很多。}
#{142}{}{Were you taught to speak only one-word sentences? Well, at least I got something useful out of you.}
{142}{}{你被教导只说一个单词和一个句子吗？好吧，至少我从你身上得到了一些有用的东西。}
