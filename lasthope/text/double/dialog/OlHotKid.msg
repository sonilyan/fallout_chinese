{100}{}{You see: a male child.}
{101}{}{He looks terrified.}
#dude ne vidi malog
{102}{}{Please... [The voice is coming from behind you.] Help me...}
{103}{}{Whoa! Hey, who's there?}
{104}{}{I'm... (Oh... It's a little child.) I'm Nick.}
{105}{}{What are you doing here?}
{106}{}{I'm hiding. Those... those murderers came and killed my family. [Starts crying.]}
{107}{}{Easy kid, I'm here to help. You just stay here, I'll take care of them.}
#dude ponovo prica sa malim
{108}{}{Are they gone? I'm so scared... please make them leave!}
{109}{}{Stay here. It's not safe outside. I'll come back.}
{110}{}{Yes, they are.}
#yes, they are
{111}{}{[His eyes light up for a second, but harden quickly again. He may be done crying for this life-time.] Good.
 [He pauses.] What about the others?}
{112}{}{I'm afraid they are all dead.} #to 114/node007
{113}{}{What about them?} #to 115/node008
#all dead
{114}{}{I mean the other bandits. } #space as it adds 115 to this
#
{115}{}{Won't they come back? While hiding I heard them talk, and laugh, about the things they did, and [he heaves]
 are going to do. Later, it was quiet again, and they said they would move here, and out of that warehouse. That's
 where their leader is... I know the place, it isn't far from here... [He points rather uselessly]... I can take you there... That
 will make it stop, won't it?}
{116}{}{Yes, let's finish this.}
{117}{}{Their leader...!? Hm, I need to prepare for this, give me a second.}
