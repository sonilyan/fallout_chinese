#{130}{}{Are you interested in buying gecko eggs?}
{130}{}{你有兴趣买壁虎蛋吗？}
#{131}{}{Hell yeah! People can't get enough of those things! I'll buy them for }
{131}{}{见鬼，耶！人们对这些东西是不会满足的！我给你买}
#{132}{}{ bucks each.}
{132}{}{每人50美元。}
#{133}{}{Do you have a regular supplier of eggs?}
{133}{}{你们有固定的鸡蛋供应商吗？}
#{134}{}{Nah. They come from hunters up north and northeast. Sometimes the hunters bring them down themselves, but usually they sell them to caravans right on the spot, who sell them to me. Everyone wins - the hunters can get back to hunting, the caravans make a few extra bucks, and I don't need to get tied down to any contracts.}
{134}{}{不。它们来自北部和东北部的猎人。有时猎人自己把它们带下来，但通常他们当场卖给商队，商队把它们卖给我。每个人都赢了――猎人们可以回去打猎，商队多赚几块钱，我不需要被任何合同束缚住。}
#{135}{}{I'll sell you all the eggs I've got.}
{135}{}{我把所有的鸡蛋都卖给你。}
#{136}{}{}
{136}{}{}
#{137}{}{I'll think about the offer.}
{137}{}{我会考虑这个提议的。}
#{138}{}{Thanks. Here's the money.}
{138}{}{谢谢。这是钱。}
#{139}{}{You're welcome.}
{139}{}{不客气。}
#{140}{}{Uh... Do you actually *have* any eggs?}
{140}{}{休斯敦大学。。。你真的有鸡蛋吗？}
#{141}{}{What? They were right here a second ago...}
{141}{}{什么？他们刚才还在这里。。。}
#{142}{}{Hey, I worked hard for these! How about another $10 per egg?}
{142}{}{嘿，我为这些努力了！再给每个鸡蛋10美元怎么样？}
#{143}{}{}
{143}{}{}
#{144}{}{Hey, we're all working hard! I have to run a business here, you know? Take it or leave it.}
{144}{}{嘿，我们都很努力！我得在这里做生意，你知道吗？要么接受，要么放弃。}
#{145}{}{Fine, I'll sell the eggs for your price.}
{145}{}{好吧，我按你的价格把鸡蛋卖了。}
#{146}{}{In that case, I'm leaving.}
{146}{}{那样的话，我就走了。}
#{147}{}{Hmm... Well, those eggs have been hard to come by, lately. I think my customers will pay a little more for them.}
{147}{}{隐马尔可夫模型。。。嗯，这些蛋最近很难弄到。我想我的顾客会多付一点钱。}
#{150}{}{You going to order something?}
{150}{}{你要点菜吗？}

#{157}{}{Got it. Another question, please.}
{157}{}{知道了。请再问一个问题。}
#{158}{}{That would be all, thanks.}
{158}{}{就这些了，谢谢。}
#{160}{}{I'm looking for the girl from this photo.}
{160}{}{我在找这张照片上的女孩。}
#{161}{}{Hmm... Nope. Never seen girls with holes for eyes around here. Ha!}
{161}{}{隐马尔可夫模型。。。不。在这附近从没见过眼睛有洞的女孩。哈！}
#{164}{}{Why'd you call this place the Cotton Club?}
{164}{}{你为什么叫这里棉花俱乐部？}
#{165}{}{Huh... I'm not really sure. I think I read it on a poster somewhere and liked the sound of it.}
{165}{}{呵呵。。。我不太确定。我想我是在某个地方的海报上读到的，喜欢它的声音。}
#{166}{}{Seen any bikers lately?}
{166}{}{最近见过骑自行车的吗？}
#{167}{}{I wish I didn't! Those pricks are really out of control. They got kicked out of most places around here, so they decided to start to shit in my club! Would be nice to get rid of them. Weird, though - I didn't see any bikes. What kind of bikers have no bikes? Weird...}
{167}{}{但愿我没有！那些混蛋真的失控了。他们被踢出了这里的大多数地方，所以他们决定开始在我的俱乐部拉屎！摆脱他们就好了。奇怪，不过-我没看到自行车。什么样的人没有自行车？奇怪的。。。}
#{170}{}{Got any work?}
{170}{}{有工作吗？}
#{171}{}{Well, I have something in mind, but it's a bit risky.}
{171}{}{嗯，我有个主意，但有点冒险。}
#{172}{}{Nah, I don't need risk.}
{172}{}{不，我不需要冒险。}
#{173}{}{Sounds good. Lay it out.}
{173}{}{听起来不错。把它摆出来。}
#{174}{}{One of the "Nevada Express" workers told me about a comedian in Vegas. Apparently, he's looking for work, but he doesn't have enough money to leave. And frankly, I don't have that kind of money either.}
{174}{}{一个“内华达快车”的工作人员告诉我在维加斯有个喜剧演员。显然，他在找工作，但他没有足够的钱离开。坦白说，我也没有那么多钱。}
#{175}{}{So...?}
{175}{}{所以。。。？}
#{176}{}{So I'll pay $1500 if you deliver him. Not all at once, though - I'll need a couple of shows to build up that kind of cash. But think about it, you'll be the sponsor for the hottest show in Reno!}
{176}{}{如果你把他送过来我就付1500美元。不过，不是一下子全部――我需要几场演出来积累这笔钱。但想想看，你将成为雷诺最热门节目的赞助商！}
#{177}{}{I'll see what I can do. Vegas, right?}
{177}{}{我看看我能做什么。维加斯，对吧？}
#{178}{}{Doesn't sound worth my time.}
{178}{}{听起来不值得我花时间。}
#{179}{}{That's right. I'll be waiting.}
{179}{}{这是正确的。我会等的。}
#{180}{}{Later.}
{180}{}{以后再说。}
#{181}{}{Hey, there you are! I was starting to worry you wouldn't be back. I bet you're itching to get that comedian off your hands, huh?}
{181}{}{嘿，你来了！我开始担心你不会回来了。我打赌你一定很想把那个喜剧演员从你手上弄下来，是吧？}
#{182}{}{That's an understatement! Take the bugger before I throttle him!}
{182}{}{这是轻描淡写！在我勒死他之前抓住他！}
#{183}{}{You know, I think I'll miss him... Just a little.}
{183}{}{你知道，我想我会想念他的。。。就一点点。}
#{184}{}{Well, you got him here, which means... We are gonna get rich! Ha! I bet $500 will make you feel better. I'll have the rest of it in a week. Sorry about such delays.}
{184}{}{好吧，你把他带到这里了，这意味着。。。我们要发财了！哈！我打赌500美元会让你感觉好些。剩下的我一周后就要了。抱歉耽搁了。}
#{185}{}{You'd better have it by then!}
{185}{}{你最好到那时就拿到了！}
#{186}{}{I'll wait, no problems.}
{186}{}{我等着，没问题。}
#{187}{}{I'm here for the payment.}
{187}{}{我是来付款的。}
#{188}{}{Of course, here's $1000, like we agreed. This guy's sharper than a razor, the money's rolling in quick. Not sure how long he'll last, though, with all his... Quirks... And habits.}
{188}{}{当然，这是1000美元，我们说好的。这家伙比剃刀还锋利，钱来得快。不知道他能撑多久，虽然，他所有的。。。怪癖。。。和习惯。}
#{189}{}{What quirks?}
{189}{}{什么怪癖？}
#{190}{}{He's tried literally everything here, everything he could anyway! Drugs, sex, gambling, he even set his hair on fire while freebasing. Shit, this guy ain't right in the head, but he knows his job and the crowd loves him. All that's left for me is to rake in the dough... While it's still possible.}
{190}{}{他已经尝试了这里的一切，不管怎样他都能尝试！毒品，性，赌博，他甚至在做自由职业的时候把头发烧了。妈的，这家伙脑子不好，但他知道自己的工作，观众也喜欢他。剩下的就是把面团耙进去。。。尽管这仍然是可能的。}
#{191}{}{How could you! This is a man's life we're talking about, and you are just milking him like brahmin? Damn, if I knew, I wouldn't have brought him here.}
{191}{}{你怎么能！我们谈论的是一个人的生活，而你只是像婆罗门一样给他挤奶？该死，如果我知道，我就不会带他来了。}
#{192}{}{Yeah, something tells me he won't end well. Anyway, you have fun.}
{192}{}{是啊，我觉得他不会有好下场的。总之，你玩得开心。}
#{200}{}{I want to eat... Help... I'm hungry...}
{200}{}{我想吃。。。帮助。。。我饿了。。。}
#{201}{}{We don't serve beggars. I will ask you to leave.}
{201}{}{我们不为乞丐服务。我请你离开。}
#{202}{}{[Looks at you, then lowers his head] Ughh...}
{202}{}{[看着你，然后低下头]啊。。。}
#{203}{}{Pleeease! I haven't eaten in 3 days!}
{203}{}{拜托！我已经三天没吃东西了！}
#{204}{}{Yes I understand, pal, I understand...}
{204}{}{是的，我明白，伙计，我明白。。。}
#{205}{}{Pleeease!}
{205}{}{拜托！}
#{206}{}{Okay. Here how it goes: You want something to eat - work for it. It's a bit of a mess here, you have to sweep, fix the chairs, clean the tables. When you do that, I will feed you. Ok?}
{206}{}{可以。事情是这样的：你想要吃的东西-为它工作。这里有点乱，你得打扫，修理椅子，打扫桌子。当你那样做的时候，我会喂你的。好 啊？}
#{207}{}{Yes! Yes! Yes!!!}
{207}{}{对！对！对！！！}
#{208}{}{Greedy bastard! I better just go away from here!}
{208}{}{贪婪的混蛋！我最好离开这里！}
#{209}{}{Oh! So you want it all for free! Dont even think coming to me with complains about, how pitiful you are. Got that?}
{209}{}{哦！所以你想要免费的！别想来找我抱怨你有多可怜。明白了吗？}
#{210}{}{[Proudly lift the chest and exit]}
{210}{}{[自豪地抬起胸膛，离开]}
#{211}{}{Well, then start right now. There is the rags, and there is the mop. Later I will show you where is the toilet.}
{211}{}{好吧，那现在就开始吧。那是抹布，那是拖把。稍后我会告诉你厕所在哪里。}
#{212}{}{Let's go!}
{212}{}{走吧！}
#{213}{}{For cleaning of the room, you get 200 experience points. Janitor - it sounds good!}
{213}{}{打扫房间可获得200点经验值。看门人-听起来不错！}
#{214}{}{(You easily deal with cleaning. A satisfied owner generously rewarded with a tasty sandwich, juicy fruit and a bottle of cold beer!) Hey, you want to stay for a while? Have some beer, huh?}
{214}{}{（你很容易处理清洁工作。满意的店主慷慨地奖励了一个美味的三明治、多汁的水果和一瓶冷啤酒！）嘿，你想呆一会儿吗？喝点啤酒吧？}
#{215}{}{Beer? This is great!}
{215}{}{啤酒？这太好了！}
#{216}{}{No, someone is waiting for me, I'll stop by later. Bye!}
{216}{}{不，有人在等我，我一会儿过来。再见！}
#{217}{}{(for some time you sit with this man and talk about Reno and the problems of the caf?. The man pours his soul to you, talks about how he was fed up and and just wants to say, fuck it all in the ass and be done with it, to everything)}
{217}{}{（有一段时间你和这个人坐在一起，谈论雷诺和咖啡馆的问题？）？。这个男人向你倾诉他的灵魂，谈论他是如何受够了，只想说，操他妈的，一切都完了，一切都完了）}
#{218}{}{Well, we can always abandon everything, but how to regain it after - this is what we should aim for!}
{218}{}{好吧，我们可以放弃一切，但如何重新获得它后-这是我们应该瞄准的目标！}
#{219}{}{Yeah, an ass - is an ass. Thats right! And there is nothing you can do about it!}
{219}{}{是啊，屁股-就是屁股。没错！你对此无能为力！}
#{220}{}{Yeah... Ah, easy to say. You try to establish your business when there are so many extortionists and druggies!}
{220}{}{是 啊。。。啊，说起来容易。当有那么多敲诈者和毒品贩子的时候，你却试图建立你的生意！}
#{221}{}{Yeah... And and the worst part is - there are no alternatives! Circle of junkies, drug dealers, racketeers! I sometimes just want to give up....}
{221}{}{是 啊。。。最糟糕的是-没有别的选择！一群瘾君子，毒贩，敲诈勒索者！我有时只是想放弃。。。。}
#{222}{}{Have you thought to move to another location, more quieter?}
{222}{}{你想过搬到另一个更安静的地方吗？}
#{223}{}{Why opening your business and suffer? You would be better working for someone, less responsibility!}
{223}{}{为什么要开公司受苦？你最好为别人工作，少负责任！}
#{224}{}{Ha! Where is a quiet place here? Around "Silver", but there is already all spots are occupied! The hotel itself has a restaurant, and the caravan has its own merchant, he is the first all profit comes to... But actually, it's an idea, friend! Move that way a little bit, and maybe, I will be able to find something better!}
{224}{}{哈！这里哪有安静的地方？周围“银装素裹”，但已经有所有的斑点都被占据了！酒店本身就有餐厅，商队也有自己的商户，他是所有利润第一个来的。。。但实际上，这是个主意，朋友！往那边挪一点，也许，我能找到更好的！}
#{225}{}{Ha! Where is a normal workplace here? Except that hotel or casino, but there is already all positions are taken. It's not that nice and dandy there - there is always some shit going on, better to own your own business... But, it's a thought - maybe I need another way to do business?}
{225}{}{哈！这里哪里有正常的工作场所？除了那家酒店或赌场，但已经有了所有的位置。那里不是那么好和漂亮-总是有一些狗屎在发生，最好是拥有自己的企业。。。但是，这是一个想法-也许我需要另一种方式来做生意？}
#{226}{}{Yeah, and make an advertisement so people could find the place, you literaly just sit in the most inconspicuous place! Who will find you here, away from the main street?}
{226}{}{是啊，做一个广告，这样人们就可以找到那个地方，你只是坐在最不显眼的地方！谁会在这里找到你，远离大街？}
#{227}{}{Hmm. Well maybe.}
{227}{}{嗯。也许吧。}
#{228}{}{Well, friend, sorry to bore you with all this crap, I don't even have no one to talk to here. Tale care of yourself! Stop by someday someday.}
{228}{}{好吧，朋友，很抱歉用这些废话来烦你，我甚至没有人可以跟我说话。照顾好你自己！有朝一日来看看。}
#{229}{}{Good luck.}
{229}{}{祝你好运。}
#{300}{}{Hey, hey! I don't see any Nuka-Cola around here. I'm offering to fix this mistake!}
{300}{}{嘿，嘿！我在这附近没看到什么Nuka可乐。我要纠正这个错误！}
#{301}{}{Ha! If you think I'm buying from you, either you're crazy or you think I am! There are more reliable suppliers in this city.}
{301}{}{哈！如果你认为我在向你买东西，要么你疯了，要么你认为我疯了！这个城市有更可靠的供应商。}
#{302}{}{Ouch! I guess my bad reputation is catching up with me...}
{302}{}{哎哟！我想我的坏名声正在追上我。。。}
#{303}{}{Interesting. Nuka-Cola, eh? Yeah, I've heard about it... Drove, like, a hundred people to the grave this year. It's possible that a factory in Salt Lake City is still maintains quality of its product, but you don't look like a professional trader. Trying to get over humble bartender, are you?}
{303}{}{很有趣。努卡可乐，嗯？是的，我听说过。。。今年开了一百个人的车。有可能盐湖城的一家工厂仍然保持着产品的质量，但你看起来不像一个专业的贸易商。你在试着摆脱那个卑微的酒保，是吗？}
#{304}{}{It's okay. I am *really* working for the factory. Here's my license.}
{304}{}{没事的。我真的在工厂工作。这是我的驾照。}
#{305}{}{What, I don't bargain well enough for you? Man, it's not easy breaking into this business...}
{305}{}{什么，我跟你讨价还价不够好？伙计，闯进这行可不容易。。。}
#{306}{}{...and nobody knows where you actually got it. You won't fool me!}
{306}{}{…没人知道你从哪儿弄来的。你骗不了我！}
#{307}{}{What the...}
{307}{}{怎么了。。。}
#{308}{}{}
{308}{}{}
#{309}{}{Nuka-Cola from the factory! That's a good product... As long as it's legit! What's the price?}
{309}{}{来自工厂的Nuka可乐！这是个好产品。。。只要合法！价钱是多少？}
#{310}{}{Don't worry, the best one. I work directly with the factory in Salt Lake City.}
{310}{}{别担心，最好的。我直接在盐湖城的工厂工作。}
#{311}{}{Curious. And who delivers it?}
{311}{}{好奇。是谁送的？}
#{312}{}{Does it matter?}
{312}{}{有关系吗？}
#{313}{}{Eh, not really, as long as it's not my problem. I'm happy to sell the stock. I'll leave the deliveries up to you.}
{313}{}{呃，不是真的，只要不是我的问题。我很高兴卖掉股票。我把送货的事交给你。}
#{314}{}{I'll handle it, don't worry.}
{314}{}{我会处理的，别担心。}
#{315}{}{Good, I'll be back when I decide what to do.}
{315}{}{很好，等我决定怎么做的时候再回来。}
#{316}{}{Great. Then I'll order the vending machine. I think that corner is a good place for it. Just load the product in and collect your share, when the time comes. Sounds fair, right?}
{316}{}{伟大的。那我就点自动售货机。我认为那个角落是个好地方。只要把产品装进去，到时候收集你的份额。听起来很公平，对吧？}
#{317}{}{Now, we only need to sign the contract...}
{317}{}{现在，我们只需要签合同。。。}
#{350}{}{Hey, why didn't you pay that kid outside? Do you know what his parents will do to him?!}
{350}{}{嘿，你为什么不付钱给外面的那个孩子？你知道他父母会对他做什么吗？！}
#{351}{}{Aw, don't tell me you fell for that crap! The kid just wants some extra cash. He's just another street urchin, just a bit smarter than most.}
{351}{}{噢，别告诉我你上了那玩意的当！这孩子只是想要一些额外的现金。他只是另一个街头顽童，只是比大多数人聪明一点。}
#{352}{}{You're *sure* you don't owe him anything?}
{352}{}{你确定你不欠他什么？}
#{353}{}{Uh, yeah, that's right...}
{353}{}{嗯，是的，没错。。。}
#{354}{}{So he never worked at this place?}
{354}{}{所以他从没在这工作过？}
#{355}{}{Uh, yeah... Okay, I hired him, but I wouldn't say he worked! Look at this mess! I need someone who get the job done right and on time. That kid couldn't even lift a bucket, and you want me to pay him? I gave him half, and he's lucky to get that.}
{355}{}{呃，是的。。。好吧，我雇了他，但我不能说他工作过！看这一团糟！我需要一个能按时完成工作的人。那孩子连桶都提不起来，你要我付钱给他？我给了他一半，他很幸运能得到。}
#{356}{}{About that kid...}
{356}{}{关于那个孩子。。。}
#{357}{}{I already told you! He should be happy I gave him half. It's more than he deserved.}
{357}{}{我已经告诉过你了！他应该很高兴我给了他一半。这是他应得的。}
#{358}{}{Then I'll leave that on your conscience... For now.}
{358}{}{那我就让你凭良心。。。现在。}
#{359}{}{I don't think so. He did his best. No matter how little, he worked hard!}
{359}{}{我不这么认为。他尽力了。不管他有多少，他都很努力！}
#{360}{}{Pay him! Now! Or it's going to cost a lot more to fix this place up after I'm done with it!}
{360}{}{付钱给他！现在！否则我修完这个地方要花很多钱！}
#{361}{}{What about me? How hard am I working? I'm here day and night. This is my livelihood, not a charity!}
{361}{}{那我呢？我有多努力？我日夜都在这里。这是我的生计，不是慈善事业！}
#{362}{}{So that's how you want it, huh...}
{362}{}{所以这就是你想要的，嗯。。。}
#{363}{}{[He sighs] Fine, fine! Just lay off. Here's the money, go give it to him. Goddamn, buddy, you really know how to take a guy on a guilt trip...}
{363}{}{好吧，好吧！停下来。这是钱，去给他。该死的，伙计，你真的知道怎么带一个男人去内疚。。。}
#{364}{}{Much better!}
{364}{}{好多了！}
#{365}{}{Oh yeah? Just fucking try it. I'll dump your ass in the street like the other trash out back! You don't scare me!}
{365}{}{哦，是吗？他妈的试试看。我会把你扔到街上，就像后面的垃圾一样！你吓不倒我！}
#{366}{}{Wha-a-at?..}
{366}{}{什么？。。}
#{367}{}{}
{367}{}{}
#{368}{}{Damn right! Just try that again...}
{368}{}{他妈的对！再试一次。。。}
#{369}{}{I get it. Bye.}
{369}{}{我明白了。再见。}
#{370}{}{You bully the weak, thinking no one will stand up for them. But today I'm going to prove you wrong.}
{370}{}{你欺负弱者，以为没有人会支持他们。但今天我要证明你错了。}
#{371}{}{If you don't want problems with my boss, I suggest you pay the kid.}
{371}{}{如果你不想和我老板闹矛盾，我建议你付钱给那孩子。}
#{372}{}{Wait, don't touch anything! Just, don't! }
{372}{}{等等，不要碰任何东西！只是，不要！}
#{373}{}{Dammit... Fine, here's the hundred bucks. Give it to the kid, please, just leave me alone.}
{373}{}{该死的。。。好吧，这是一百美元。把它给那孩子，拜托，别管我。}
#{400}{}{Has this stage been empty for long?}
{400}{}{这个舞台空了很久了吗？}
#{401}{}{A few years now. I think the last show was before Big Louie and his gang showed up, but that was before I even owned the club. I only reopened the place last year. I've been thinking of dismantling the stage to make room for more tables.}
{401}{}{几年前。我想最后一场演出是在大路易和他的帮派出现之前，但那是在我拥有俱乐部之前。我去年才重新开张的。我一直在考虑把舞台拆掉，腾出地方放更多的桌子。}
#{402}{}{What's the problem with organizing new performances?}
{402}{}{组织新的演出有什么问题？}
#{403}{}{There's no one left. With the civil war, all of Reno's talent has died, left, or drunk themselves stupid. There are only a few people left and they don't perform anymore.}
{403}{}{没人了。内战期间，雷诺所有的天才都死了，离开了，或者喝醉了。只剩下几个人了，他们不再表演了。}
#{404}{}{Who are they?}
{404}{}{他们是谁？}
#{405}{}{We've had a jazz band a while back, but there's only three members left and they're all old. Why are you so interested, anyway?}
{405}{}{不久前我们有一支爵士乐队，但只剩下三名成员了，而且他们都很老了。你为什么这么感兴趣？}
#{406}{}{I think I could start a band. I don't think I could perform on my own, but in a band? That's a whole other question.}
{406}{}{我想我可以组建一个乐队。我不认为我能独自表演，但在乐队里？那完全是另一个问题。}
#{407}{}{Just curious, let's leave it at that.}
{407}{}{只是好奇，就这样吧。}
#{408}{}{Ah, that would be great... But it's probably more trouble than it's worth.}
{408}{}{啊，那太好了。。。但这可能比它的价值更麻烦。}
#{409}{}{I can handle it, I've gone through worse.}
{409}{}{我能应付，我经历了更糟的事情。}
#{410}{}{I want to try anyway.}
{410}{}{我还是想试试。}
#{411}{}{Fine, fine. Just don't expect help from me. I've got my own problems.}
{411}{}{很好，很好。别指望我的帮助。我有我自己的问题。}
#{412}{}{Any suggestions?}
{412}{}{有什么建议吗？}
#{413}{}{Well, I've seen Ornette around. Used to play the trombone with the old band. Talk to him, he lives in Wright's slums across from the casino.}
{413}{}{嗯，我在附近见过奥内特。以前和旧乐队一起吹长号。跟他说，他住在赌场对面赖特的贫民窟里。}
#{414}{}{Okay.}
{414}{}{可以。}
#{415}{}{About the band...}
{415}{}{关于乐队。。。}
#{416}{}{Anything on your mind?}
{416}{}{你有什么想法吗？}
#{417}{}{Tell me about the trombone player again. Who is he and where is he?}
{417}{}{再跟我说说长号演奏者。他是谁？他在哪里？}
#{418}{}{Ornette is ready to come back on stage.}
{418}{}{奥内特准备重返舞台。}
#{419}{}{I've found an, uh, "underappreciated" drummer. A little training and he'll be perfect.}
{419}{}{我找到了一个，呃，“不受赏识”的鼓手。稍加训练，他就会很完美。}
#{420}{}{Got us a guitarist. His name's Richard.}
{420}{}{给我们找了个吉他手。他叫理查德。}
#{421}{}{Looks like we've got a band: guitar, drums and trombone. I think I can handle the vocals.}
{421}{}{看来我们有乐队了：吉他，鼓和长号。我想我能处理好声音。}
#{422}{}{Don't worry.}
{422}{}{别担心。}
#{423}{}{Ornette, he used to play the trombone, but that was a long time ago. You'll find him in Wright's slums across from the El Dorado.}
{423}{}{奥内特，他过去常吹长号，但那是很久以前的事了。你会在埃尔多拉多对面的赖特贫民窟找到他。}
#{424}{}{You managed to convince him?! Huh... I was sure he sold his instrument... Oh well. But one trombone won't be enough. You'll need more - drums, vocals, probably a guitar. Can't help you there though. Maybe Ornette knows someone else? Ask him.}
{424}{}{你说服了他？！呵呵。。。我肯定他卖掉了他的乐器。。。哦，好吧。但是一个长号是不够的。你需要更多的鼓，人声，可能是吉他。但我帮不了你。也许奥内特认识其他人？问问他。}
#{425}{}{Good news. Another one or two and we can consider some concerts.}
{425}{}{好消息。再来一两场，我们可以考虑开几场音乐会。}
#{426}{}{Richard? Isn't that the drunk I kicked out? I'm surprised you managed to convince him. One guitar won't be enough, though.}
{426}{}{理查德？那不是我踢出去的那个醉鬼吗？我很惊讶你能说服他。不过，一把吉他是不够的。}
#{427}{}{[His mouth drops open] Are you serious?! I didn't think you'd actually do it! Call everyone in, let's see what you've got.}
{427}{}{你是认真的吗？！我没想到你真的会这么做！叫所有人进来，看看你有什么。}
#{428}{}{Got it.}
{428}{}{知道了。}
#{429}{}{That's all for now. Wait for the news.}
{429}{}{现在就这些。等待消息。}
#{430}{}{Looks like everyone's here.}
{430}{}{看来大家都来了。}
#{431}{}{That's right. We're ready when you are.}
{431}{}{这是正确的。你准备好了我们就准备好了。}
#{432}{}{[Continue]}
{432}{}{[继续]}
#{433}{}{Can't do that now, can you wait a little.}
{433}{}{现在不行，你能等一下吗。}
#{434}{}{Amazing! How do you all manage to handle it so well? Should be better than to peel a potato, right?.. Now, come here, cap, we've got a serious discussion ahead.}
{434}{}{太神了！你们怎么处理得这么好？应该比剥土豆好吧？。。现在，过来，队长，我们前面有一个严肃的讨论。}
#{435}{}{Something happened?}
{435}{}{出什么事了？}
#{436}{}{Not yet. But, you see, nothing is quite that easy. I didn't mention it before because... Well, I didn't think you'd pull it off anyway. But now, seeing how serious you are, it looks like I'll have to tell you. My place is in Mr. Thompson's territory. I have to give him a part of my profits as protection money. But, honestly, it's just robbery, not protection! I'd have more luck with my double-barrel. Anyway, now interest in the club is going to rise.}
{436}{}{还没有。但是，你看，没有什么是那么容易的。我以前没提是因为。。。我没想到你会成功。但现在，看你有多认真，看来我得告诉你。我在汤普森先生的地盘。我得给他一部分利润作为保护费。但是，老实说，这只是抢劫，不是保护！我的双桶会更幸运。不管怎样，现在对俱乐部的兴趣会上升。}
#{437}{}{So, you think he's going to crack down on you?}
{437}{}{所以，你认为他会打击你？}
#{438}{}{Thompson will want to increase payments. That, and advertising costs - we'll need posters, advertisers, tickets, food, drink. I'm gonna go bankrupt just on that. And I'm not even sure we're gonna turn a profit. So, i need you to do me a favor and talk to Thompson to sort things out. If you are still in, that is.}
{438}{}{汤普森想增加付款。还有广告费用――我们需要海报、广告商、门票、食物、饮料。我就要破产了。我甚至不确定我们是否能盈利。所以，我需要你帮我个忙，和汤普森谈谈把事情解决。如果你还在，那就是。}
#{439}{}{I get it. I'll do my best...}
{439}{}{我明白了。我会尽力的。。。}
#{440}{}{Well, that would be great. But I think that's going to be more problems than it's worth...that's not the point, though. No offence, but this just isn't for you. The audience just isn't going to appreciate your, uh... Unique charisma.}
{440}{}{那太好了。但我认为这将是更多的问题比它的价值…这不是重点，虽然。无意冒犯，但这不是给你的。观众不会欣赏你的。。。独特的魅力。}
#{441}{}{Oh well, up to you.}
{441}{}{哦，好吧，由你决定。}
#{442}{}{Let's talk about the gangsters.}
{442}{}{我们来谈谈黑帮。}
#{443}{}{Like I said: Thompson's bleeding me dry for protection money. To run the event, I'll need to hand him over a sizeable chunk of the earnings.}
{443}{}{就像我说的：汤普森为了保护费把我榨干了。为了办这个活动，我需要把相当大一部分收入交给他。}
#{444}{}{I talked to Thompson. Everything will be fine.}
{444}{}{我和汤普森谈过了。一切都会好的。}
#{445}{}{Mister Thompson has left the business. For good.}
{445}{}{汤普森先生已经离开了公司。永远。}
#{446}{}{What if we switch sides?}
{446}{}{如果我们交换立场呢？}
#{447}{}{Could we run the whole thing without gang involvement?}
{447}{}{我们能在没有帮派参与的情况下处理整个事情吗？}
#{448}{}{I'll get back to you about that.}
{448}{}{我会给你回电的。}
#{449}{}{Dead? You sure? Oh... I thought that was just Stryker spreading rumors. Anyway, it doesn't change anything. We can't do this without proper protection. We'll have to cut a deal with one of the other gangs. Luciano, Bertolini, Wright, anyone will do as long as they can provide the proper security. You might even manage to work out a better deal than what we've had with Thompson.}
{449}{}{死了？你确定？哦。。。我以为那只是史崔克散布谣言。不管怎样，这不会改变什么。没有适当的保护我们不能这样做。我们得和其他帮派达成协议。卢西亚诺，贝托里尼，赖特，任何人都会做，只要他们能提供适当的安全。你甚至可以找到一个比我们和汤普森做的更好的交易。}
#{450}{}{What if we WHAT?! These guys aren't the forgiving types! Maybe if Thompson left the scene... But that's not gonna happen any time soon.}
{450}{}{如果我们什么？！这些人不是那种宽容的人！如果汤普森离开现场。。。但这不会很快发生。}
#{451}{}{No, too risky. Everyone's gonna want a piece of the action - thieves, punks, you know the types. We need to protect ourselves and our customers. And for that, we need help of influential people.}
{451}{}{不，太冒险了。每个人都会想分一杯羹的-小偷，朋克，你知道他们的类型。我们需要保护我们自己和我们的客户。为此，我们需要有影响力的人的帮助。}
#{452}{}{Great news! They'll probably send someone over to discuss the details.}
{452}{}{好消息！他们可能会派人过来讨论细节。}
#{453}{}{[Next]}
{453}{}{[下一步]}
#{454}{}{Alright, time to get ready for the concert.}
{454}{}{好了，该为音乐会做准备了。}
#{455}{}{Anything I should do?}
{455}{}{我该做什么？}
#{456}{}{First off, we need to hang up posters. Try and hire some kids from the slums, the more the better, it'll look good on our rep. Speaking of, here are the posters, already sorted out the printing. They're all black and white, but it's probably for the best. After all, so is your band. Heh-heh-heh!}
{456}{}{首先，我们需要挂海报。试着从贫民窟里雇些孩子，越多越好，在我们的销售代表那里会很好看。说到这里，这是海报，已经整理好了印刷品。他们都是黑白的，但这可能是最好的。毕竟，你的乐队也是。嘿嘿！}
#{457}{}{Okay. What next?}
{457}{}{可以。接下来呢？}
#{458}{}{Next comes the concert. It's planned for }
{458}{}{接下来是音乐会。计划是为了}
#{459}{}{You've still got time until 10 p.m., we won't start any sooner.}
{459}{}{你还有时间到晚上10点，我们不会早点出发的。}
#{460}{}{Okay, wouldn't want to miss it. See you!}
{460}{}{好吧，我不想错过。再见！}
#{461}{}{Let's begin the concert.}
{461}{}{让我们开始音乐会吧。}
#{462}{}{It's time already?}
{462}{}{时间到了？}
#{463}{}{[Next]}
{463}{}{[下一步]}
#{464}{}{I get it! You must be kidding. The concert will be on }
{464}{}{我明白了！你一定在开玩笑。音乐会就要开始了}
#{465}{}{Are you serious?! Where were you? We've finished the first performance without you. We did great, by the way, not that you'd know!}
{465}{}{你是认真的吗？！你在哪里？没有你我们已经完成了第一场演出。顺便说一句，我们做得很好，你不会知道的！}
#{466}{}{I was busy.}
{466}{}{我很忙。}
#{467}{}{People showed up expecting a four-man band. They expected singing! We disappointed some powerful people tonight. The music was still a hit, but I don't like surprises. Sorry friendo, but you're out of the band. We'll do well enough without you.}
{467}{}{人们期待着一支四人乐队的到来。他们想要唱歌！今晚我们让一些有权势的人失望了。音乐仍然很流行，但我不喜欢惊喜。抱歉，朋友，你不在乐队里。没有你，我们会做得很好的。}
#{468}{}{But this is my band!}
{468}{}{但这是我的乐队！}
#{469}{}{[Leave]}
{469}{}{[离开]}
#{470}{}{There's more people than you in this band, and you let them down. Sorry pal, you're outvoted.}
{470}{}{乐队里的人比你多，你让他们失望了。抱歉，伙计，你被淘汰了。}
#{471}{}{Give me one chance!}
{471}{}{给我一次机会！}
#{472}{}{NO! NO! And NO!!!!}
{472}{}{不！不！不！！！！}
#{473}{}{Hmm... Looks like the members don't mind. Come in on }
{473}{}{隐马尔可夫模型。。。看来成员们不介意。进来吧}
#{476}{}{I had to cancel the concert because our protection is gone. You probably already know these people can't help us. We need new arrangement. And as quickly as possible.}
{476}{}{我不得不取消音乐会，因为我们的保护措施不见了。你可能已经知道这些人帮不了我们了。我们需要新的安排。而且越快越好。}
#{477}{}{That's not bad.}
{477}{}{还不错。}
#{478}{}{ at 10 p.m.. Don't be late.}
{478}{}{晚上10点。。别迟到了。}
#{479}{}{Since we've dealt with the security issue, I'll set up the show on a new date. Come in on }
{479}{}{既然我们已经处理了安全问题，我会安排一个新的日期。进来吧}
#{480}{}{Good!}
{480}{}{很好！}
#{481}{}{Great show! We've completely sold out. It's like the old days - entertainment, community, powerful people spending money... The thing i've been dreaming about for the last ten years. Keep this up and we'll be rich!}
{481}{}{精彩的表演！我们已经卖完了。就像过去一样-娱乐，社区，有权势的人花钱。。。这是我十年来一直梦想的事情。再这样下去，我们就发财了！}
#{482}{}{[Next]}
{482}{}{[下一步]}
#{483}{}{Here's your cut. Listen, we've got to put on another show! Come in on }
{483}{}{这是你的份。听着，我们得换个节目了！进来吧}
#{484}{}{Great!}
{484}{}{太好了！}
#{485}{}{That's good, but I had to cancel the concert.}
{485}{}{很好，但是我不得不取消音乐会。}
#{486}{}{What?! Why?!}
{486}{}{什么？！为什么？}
#{487}{}{I was told that if I don't stop, then I'm dead. I love music, but not enough to die for it. I don't think the others want to die for it either. Sorry.}
{487}{}{有人告诉我，如果我不停下来，我就死定了。我喜欢音乐，但还不够为它而死。我想其他人也不想为此而死。对不起的。}
#{488}{}{Tell me the details.}
{488}{}{告诉我细节。}
#{489}{}{Hm, I don't like this. Let's hope your protection sorts this out.}
{489}{}{嗯，我不喜欢这样。希望你的保护能解决这个问题。}
#{490}{}{Don't know much more. Two guys in masks showed up and stuck some peashooter in my face. I was lucky Ornette was around and scared them off. That's about it.}
{490}{}{不知道更多。两个戴着面具的家伙出现在我面前，用枪指着我的脸。我很幸运奥内特在附近把他们吓跑了。就这样。}
#{491}{}{Hmm, well, good luck. I'll come in from time to time, don't worry.}
{491}{}{嗯，好吧，祝你好运。我会不时来的，别担心。}
#{492}{}{I doubt that. To honest, I don't trust them. They're the types to grab some poor suckers from the streets and say that they're the ones.}
{492}{}{我对此表示怀疑。老实说，我不相信他们。他们是那种从街上抓些可怜的笨蛋，然后说他们就是他们的人。}
#{493}{}{I sorted it out. There's this guy Martin... [explain the details]}
{493}{}{我解决了。有个叫马丁的家伙。。。[解释细节]}
#{494}{}{...what the hell is that all about? Jazz is only for blacks? I mean, it's the twenty-second century, I thought we were past that shit already.}
{494}{}{…这到底是怎么回事？爵士乐只适合黑人？我是说，现在是22世纪，我还以为我们已经过去了呢。}
#{495}{}{[Next]}
{495}{}{[下一步]}
#{496}{}{Anyway, since Martin's not a problem anymore, let's set up another show. Come in on }
{496}{}{不管怎样，既然马丁不再是个问题了，我们再安排一个节目吧。进来吧}
#{497}{}{Here's your cut. Sorry, but that's the last one.}
{497}{}{这是你的份。对不起，这是最后一个了。}
#{498}{}{Ornette and the rest are worried about the situation with Martin and want to part ways. I couldn't convince them otherwise and letting the whole band go just because of one vocalist isn't in my best interests. You get it, right?}
{498}{}{奥内特和其他人担心马丁的情况，想分道扬镳。我没法说服他们，仅仅因为一个歌手就让整个乐队离开对我来说不是最好的。你明白了吧？}
#{499}{}{This was one wild ride, friend. It was a pleasure. I'll tell you what, you've got a 50% discount in my club for life. And anyway, you're a celebrity in Reno now. You're somebody. Isn't that worth something?}
{499}{}{这是一次疯狂的旅行，朋友。很荣幸。我告诉你，你在我的俱乐部终身享受五折优惠。不管怎样，你现在是雷诺的名人了。你真了不起。这不值钱吗？}
