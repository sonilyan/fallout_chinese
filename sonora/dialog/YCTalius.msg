### {323}{}{Are you asking me to KILL him?}
{323}{}{你是要我杀了他吗？}

{324}{}{（叹气）会有食尸鬼举手攻击他们的同伴吗？我不这么认为。许多食尸鬼会谴责它。但也没有治愈精神错乱的方法。我们只能做一件事? 避免不必要的牺牲。}

### {341}{}{Well, now his soul will calm down. (sigh) Good. I don't hold a grudge against you. I'm only angry at myself for not being able to help the distraught. Obviously, all ghouls will end up with this sooner or later. There is no cure for insanity.}
{341}{}{好吧，现在他的灵魂会平静下来。（叹气）很好。我对你没有怨恨。我只是为自己没能帮助那些心烦意乱的人而生气。显然，所有的食尸鬼迟早都会有这样的下场。精神错乱是无法治愈的。}
### {342}{}{Don't blame yourself. Life goes on after all.}
{342}{}{不要责怪自己。生活终究还在继续。}

{346}{}{Gonzo现在不危险了，对吧？}
### {347}{}{Thank you. Gonzo the madman is securely sealed behind bars. Obviously, all ghouls will end up with this sooner or later. There is no cure for insanity. It remains only to lock up Gonzo to avoid unnecessary casualties. If you need soul and body treatment, I will also try to help.}
{347}{}{非常感谢。疯子贡佐被牢牢地关在监狱里。显然，所有的食尸鬼迟早都会有这样的下场。精神错乱是无法治愈的。它仍然只是为了把贡佐关起来以避免不必要的伤亡。如果你需要灵魂和身体治疗，我也会尽力帮助你。}
