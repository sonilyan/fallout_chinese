#{115}{}{[Shake him by the shoulder] Hello, young man, do you hear me?..}
{115}{}{[摇他的肩膀]你好，年轻人，你听到我说的了吗？。。}
#{116}{}{Oh! Sorry! I was stuck in thoughts! I have a puzzle that makes my brain boil!}

{117}{}{说真的？也许我可以打开你的头骨看看？}

#{129}{}{Well, okay, listen. One caravan merchant walked three cities. In the first he was charged with renting a parking lot for a quarter of the cost of goods. And in the second city they also sought a quarter of what was left on him. In the third city - a quarter of the remainder. When he returned home, he had only 1728 bucks, but he could not sell anything. So, how much did he have at the very beginning?}
{129}{}{好吧，听着。一个商队商人走了三个城市。起初，他被指控以货物成本的四分之一租了一个停车场。在第二城，他们又寻梢他所剩的四分之一。在第三个城市――剩下的四分之一。当他回到家，他只有1728美元，但他不能出售任何东西。那么，他一开始有多少钱？}
#{130}{}{But this is easy! I can answer right now.}
{130}{}{但这很简单！我现在可以回答。}
#{131}{}{Stupid puzzle! Didn't they teach you to count? Figures - do you even know how to walk, at least?..}
{131}{}{愚蠢的拼图！他们没教你数数吗？你知道怎么走路吗？。。}
#{132}{}{Hmm... You know, I don't care about it right now, so I will stop by later. Bye!}

#{140}{}{Er... I don't now, actually. Let's solve it later...}
{140}{}{呃。。。实际上，我现在不知道。我们以后再解决吧。。。}
#{141}{}{[It seems he doesn't believe you] What?! No! This is not right! It must be 3375!!!}
{141}{}{[他好像不相信你]什么？！不！这不对！一定是3375！！！}
#{142}{}{Is it? No, little one, you're counting wrong. Does the truth hurts? Looooser!!!}
{142}{}{它是？不，小家伙，你数错了。真相伤人吗？loooser！！！}
#{143}{}{Are you sure? Well, you know better. I'll just leave you alone...}
{143}{}{你确定？好吧，你更清楚。我就让你一个人呆着。。。}
#{144}{}{Hmm, how do you know?}
{144}{}{嗯，你怎么知道的？}
#{145}{}{Well-well, you must've cheated! Boo!}
{145}{}{你一定是作弊了！喝倒采！}
#{146}{}{Like that! You can't count yourself, so stop talking! I will figure it out without you! Booo! [shows you his tongue]}
{146}{}{像那样！你不能数你自己，所以别说了！没有你我会弄清楚的！嘘！[向你展示他的舌头]}
#{147}{}{Oh you little shithead, being rude to adults?! I will teach you some manners, you brat!}

#{153}{}{Not true! There is no answer! Caravan merchants gave me this puzzle! So yeah, I will do it without you! [shows you his tongue, spitting]}
{153}{}{不是真的！没有答案！商队商人给了我这个拼图！所以是的，没有你我会做的！[向你展示他的舌头，吐口水]}
#{154}{}{Do it then, I need to go save my people. See ya.}
{154}{}{那就去吧，我要去救我的人。再见。}
#{155}{}{Well, I thought so, a quarter is 0.25, right? So you have to multiply the amount by a quarter and plus the remainder. Then I will get the second number. That, too, multiply by a quarter and add again. That turns out - 3375. Is it not??}
{155}{}{嗯，我想是的，四分之一是0.25，对吗？所以你必须把这个数字乘以四分之一，再加上余数。然后我会得到第二个号码。同样，乘以四分之一再相加。结果是-3375。不是吗？？}
#{156}{}{Nah, you make one mistake. You count a quarter of a smaller number, although at first it counts from the larger. There will be a difference, so count through the proportion.}
{156}{}{不，你犯了一个错误。你数一个小数字的四分之一，虽然一开始是从大数字算起的。会有差别的，所以要按比例计算。}
#{157}{}{Not the slightest idea! Perhaps this is too difficult for me...}
{157}{}{一点都不知道！也许这对我来说太难了。。。}
#{158}{}{You and your tiny brain can not understand this. We'll talk when you grow your balls and stop being like a girl.}
{158}{}{你和你的小脑袋都不能理解这一点。等你长大不再像个女孩了我们再谈。}
#{159}{}{What do you mean - proportion?!}
{159}{}{你什么意思-比例？！}
#{160}{}{Let me teach you...}
{160}{}{我来教你。。。}
#{161}{}{Well, you know, this is too hard for you, and I don't have time.}
{161}{}{嗯，你知道，这对你来说太难了，我没有时间。}
#{162}{}{You're lying to me!!!}
{162}{}{你在骗我！！！}
#{163}{}{No... Uh, fine, let me teach you.}
{163}{}{不。。。好吧，我来教你。}
#{164}{}{Think what you want, I do not care - you're just not right.}
{164}{}{想想你想要什么，我不在乎-你就是不对。}
