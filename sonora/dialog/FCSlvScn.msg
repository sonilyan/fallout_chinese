#Dialog
### {200}{}{(adjusts his glasses, peering into your face) Oh, Mom, what are you doing here?}
{200}{}{（调整眼镜，凝视你的脸）哦，妈妈，你在这里干什么？}
### {201}{}{I'm looking for my relatives. Have you heard anything about the peasants from the Villa?}
{201}{}{我在找我的亲戚。你听说过山庄里的农民吗？}
### {202}{}{That's it... Okay, okay, I know about them. The mercenaries dragged a whole crowd of peasants here and locked them up with the rest of the prisoners. Don't even think about going to their rescue - it will end badly.}
{202}{}{就这样…好吧，好吧，我知道他们。雇佣兵把一群农民拖到这里，把他们和其他囚犯一起关起来。甚至不要考虑去营救他们――结果会很糟糕。}
### {203}{}{Is there a way to get into the pen?}
{203}{}{有办法进入钢笔吗？}
### {204}{}{Well, if you have a lot of caps, then Faber will let you in. I just don't know if it will *release*... I'll tell you one thing - the prison guards have a lazy job, so try to suck up to one of them.}
{204}{}{好吧，如果你有很多帽子，那么费伯会让你进去的。我只是不知道它是否会发布。。。我要告诉你一件事――狱警的工作很懒，所以试着去讨好他们中的一个。}
### {205}{}{Wait a minute, I need to know more.}
{205}{}{等一下，我需要知道更多。}
### {206}{}{Then I'll do it myself.}
{206}{}{那我自己来做。}
### {1206}{}{Then I'll do it myself.}
{1206}{}{那我自己来做。}
### {207}{}{What do you want?}
{207}{}{你想要什么？}

### {208}{}{What is this place?}
{208}{}{这是什么地方？}
### {209}{}{This is a radio station. It is used to communicate with mercenaries at a distance. And you should get out of here as soon as possible, otherwise there is no place for outsiders here.}
{209}{}{这是一个广播电台。它被用来与远处的雇佣兵进行通信。你应该尽快离开这里，否则这里就没有外人的容身之地。}
### {210}{}{Where did all this equipment come from?}
{210}{}{这些设备是从哪里来的？}
### {211}{}{I don't know. It was already standing here when I was brought in.}
{211}{}{我不知道。当我被带进来的时候，它已经站在这里了。}
### {212}{}{How interesting. And on what frequency do the mercenaries talk?}
{212}{}{真有趣。雇佣兵的谈话频率是多少？}
### {213}{}{That's exactly what I shouldn't say. If you want to know, go to the boss and ask him.}
{213}{}{这正是我不该说的。如果你想知道，去找老板问问他。}
### {214}{}{You're scoffing too much, four-eyes. Tell me the frequency, now!}
{214}{}{你嘲笑太多了，四只眼睛。告诉我频率，现在！}
### {215}{}{Be quiet! They'll hear us... Okay, look, this is the frequency for patrolmen, and this is for jailers. Just don't tell anyone!}
{215}{}{安静！他们会听到的…好吧，看，这是巡逻员的频率，这是狱警的频率。只是不要告诉任何人！}
### {216}{}{Yeah.}
{216}{}{是 啊}
### {217}{}{I'm going to scream! I'll scream and they'll catch you!}
{217}{}{我要尖叫了！我会尖叫，他们会抓住你的！}
### {218}{}{But you don't have to do that. Calm down.}
{218}{}{但你不必这么做。冷静}

### {219}{}{So much equipment for the sake of communication alone?}
{219}{}{仅仅为了交流就有这么多设备？}
### {220}{}{Well yes... Except for the management of collars.}
{220}{}{嗯，是的。。。除了项圈的管理。}
### {221}{}{Do you know how to disable prisoners' collars?}
{221}{}{你知道如何使犯人的项圈残废吗？}
### {222}{}{We need an access code to the terminal. Only Faber and I have it. And I won't tell it to you.}
{222}{}{我们需要一个终端的访问码。只有费伯和我有，我不会告诉你的。}
### {223}{}{Come on, do something useful for the oppressed like you. This is your chance for salvation.}
{223}{}{来吧，为像你这样的被压迫者做点有用的事。这是你获得救赎的机会。}
### {224}{}{You're going crazy! Get caught by one of the mercenaries - and you and I are waiting for something worse than the gallows! You'd better get out of here before they see us together. I don't want any problems.}
{224}{}{你快疯了！被一个雇佣兵抓住了――你和我正在等待比绞刑架更糟糕的事情！你最好在他们看到我们在一起之前离开这里。我不想有任何问题。}
### {225}{}{Well... Maybe so. I don't know if I can trust you, but we can pay with our lives for such sabotage. Here is the password, but proceed as carefully as possible!}
{225}{}{好也许是这样。我不知道我是否可以信任你，但我们可以为这种破坏行为付出生命代价。这是密码，但要尽可能小心！}
### {226}{}{The correct solution.}
{226}{}{正确的解决方案。}
### {227}{}{It looks like the equipment is not from here.}
{227}{}{看起来设备不是从这里来的。}
### {228}{}{How should I know? I'm just pushing buttons.}
{228}{}{我该怎么知道？我只是在按按钮。}
### {229}{}{Well, maybe so. The building is dilapidated, but the equipment will be newer. And the antenna is clearly out of place.}
{229}{}{好吧，也许是这样。这座建筑很破旧，但设备会更新。而且天线明显错位了。}
### {230}{}{We'll see about that.}
{230}{}{我们拭目以待。}
### {231}{}{For now.}
{231}{}{现在。}

### {250}{}{Who are you?}
{250}{}{你是谁？}
### {251}{}{They called me a Smartass here. I wasn't good enough to work in the mine, so they put me here to monitor radio communications.}
{251}{}{他们在这里叫我聪明人。我不够好，不能在矿井里工作，所以他们把我放在这里监视无线电通信。}
### {252}{}{Do you want to get out?}
{252}{}{你想出去吗？}
### {253}{}{Me? To freedom? But... What am I going to do there? The boss, though angry, at least feeds and protects from robbers. And where can I go without him? I don't know...}
{253}{}{我自由？但是我在那里该怎么办？老板虽然很生气，但至少能为强盗提供食物和保护。没有他我能去哪里？我不知道。。。}
### {254}{}{Bitch, you pawned me to Faber!}
{254}{}{婊子，你把我押给费伯了！}
### {255}{}{P-wait! Have mercy! Don't hit me! I'm just a prisoner! What was I supposed to do? After all, you have zero chances against mercenaries, and I will live here until the end of my days. If Faber had found out, he would have just killed me!}
{255}{}{P-等等！宽恕吧！别打我！我只是个囚犯！我该怎么办？毕竟，你对付雇佣兵的机会为零，我将在这里生活到最后。如果费伯发现了，他会杀了我的！}
### {256}{}{Better shut up, pussy, before I shove your glasses down your throat.}
{256}{}{最好闭嘴，小猫咪，在我把你的眼镜塞进你喉咙之前。}
### {1256}{}{Better shut up, pussy, before I shove glasses down your throat.}
{1256}{}{最好闭嘴，小猫咪，在我把眼镜塞进你喉咙之前。}
### {257}{}{Okay, live for now. I really shouldn't have trusted the first person I met.}
{257}{}{好吧，暂时活着。我真的不应该相信我遇到的第一个人。}
### {258}{}{While the equipment was in working order, it was a radio station. Now it's just a warehouse of all sorts of junk. But outsiders don't belong here anyway.}
{258}{}{当设备正常工作时，它是一个电台。现在这里只是一个堆满各种垃圾的仓库。但外来者无论如何都不属于这里。}

### {260}{}{Faber is dead. You're free.}
{260}{}{费伯死了。你自由了。}
### {261}{}{God, why?! Without Faber, the whole Flagstaff will come to an end! The mercenaries will now fight over his place, and pogroms and looting will begin in the city! Do you have any idea how much work has been invested in the arrangement of this place? Thank you, of course, for freedom, but I don't need it anymore.}
{261}{}{天啊，为什么？！没有费伯，整个弗拉格斯塔夫将走向终结！雇佣兵现在将争夺他的位置，大屠杀和抢劫将在城市开始！你知道在这个地方的布置上投入了多少工作吗？当然，谢谢你的自由，但我不再需要它了。}
### {262}{}{Hmm...}
{262}{}{嗯。。。}
### {263}{}{Why didn't you run away with the rest of the prisoners?}
{263}{}{你为什么不和其他囚犯一起逃跑？}
### {264}{}{And where should I run? In the wasteland? The first mole-rat will bite me there. And in the city they won't even look at me. Prison is the only place where my talents were appreciated, given food and protection. Think what you want, but I was satisfied with this life.}
{264}{}{我该往哪里跑？在荒原上？第一只鼹鼠会在那里咬我。在城市里，他们甚至不会看我一眼。监狱是唯一一个欣赏我的才能、给我食物和保护的地方。想想你想要什么，但我对这种生活很满意。}
### {265}{}{That's the irony. Okay, stay here, loser.}
{265}{}{具有讽刺意味的是。好吧，呆在这里，失败者。}
