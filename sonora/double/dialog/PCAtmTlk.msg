{231}{}{它保存了很长时间。直到最近才有可能启动主反应堆。 -- It has been preserved for a long time. And only recently it was possible to start the main reactor.}
### {232}{}{How did it work out?}
{232}{}{结果如何？ -- How did it work out?}
### {233}{}{Thank the fire worshippers and their colony in Flagstaff for this. Uranium is mined there on the church lid. And some of this uranium comes to us. It was a profitable contract for the whole city.}
{233}{}{为此感谢火焰崇拜者和他们在弗拉格斯塔夫的殖民地。铀是在教堂的盖子上开采的。这些铀中的一部分来到了我们这里。这对整个城市来说都是一份有利可图的合同。 -- Thank the fire worshippers and their colony in Flagstaff for this. Uranium is mined there on the church lid. And some of this uranium comes to us. It was a profitable contract for the whole city.}

{236}{}{你们是怎么来到这里的？ -- How did you all end up here?}
### {237}{}{We came from the west, from California. But this is a separate story. Coincidentally, we were offered to restore the station. After all, you, the modern generation, don't know a damn thing about the old technology.}
{237}{}{我们来自西部，来自加利福尼亚。但这是另一回事。巧合的是，我们得到了修复车站的提议。毕竟，你们现代一代对旧技术一无所知。 -- We came from the west, from California. But this is a separate story. Coincidentally, we were offered to restore the station. After all, you, the modern generation, don't know a damn thing about the old technology.}
### {238}{}{Wait a minute, do you really mean to say that you have lived for a hundred years?}
{238}{}{等等，你真的是说你已经活了一百年了吗？ -- Wait a minute, do you really mean to say that you have lived for a hundred years?}

{240}{}{告诉我，战前的世界是什么样子的？ -- Tell me, what was the world like before the war?}
### {241}{}{Hmm... A hundred years have passed, much is in a fog. I remember cars, skyscrapers and military checkpoints. I remember the war when the bombs fell on the city. But is it possible to explain all this to a person like you? It's just a story for you.}
{241}{}{嗯…一百年过去了，很多事情都是迷雾重重。我记得汽车、摩天大楼和军事检查站。我记得炸弹落在城市上的那场战争。但是，有可能向你这样的人解释这一切吗？这只是给你的一个故事。 -- Hmm... A hundred years have passed, much is in a fog. I remember cars, skyscrapers and military checkpoints. I remember the war when the bombs fell on the city. But is it possible to explain all this to a person like you? It's just a story for you.}
### {242}{}{I see it's hard for you to remember this. Let's change the subject.}
{242}{}{我知道你很难记住这件事。让我们换个话题。 -- I see it's hard for you to remember this. Let's change the subject.}
### {243}{}{Are you trying to humiliate me now? Not another word, Mr. Pockmarked Skin.}
{243}{}{你现在是想羞辱我吗？别再说了，麻子皮先生。 -- Are you trying to humiliate me now? Not another word, Mr. Pockmarked Skin.}

{245}{}{哇，这是一个强有力的词。不要把那个老人的话记在脑子里。他有点失去理智了。 -- Wow, that's a strong word. Don't take that old man's words into your head. He's losing his mind a little.}
### {246}{}{But he has to pay me for the work.}
{246}{}{但他得付我工钱。 -- But he has to pay me for the work.}
### {247}{}{Then do what he says. He needs the culprits - find them. How to do it? That's bad luck... You know, most likely the bombers penetrated through the sewers. But I thought we sealed all the entrances well.}
{247}{}{那就照他说的去做。他需要罪犯――找到他们。怎么做？那是坏运气...你知道，轰炸机很可能穿过下水道。但我认为我们把所有的入口都封得很好。 -- Then do what he says. He needs the culprits - find them. How to do it? That's bad luck... You know, most likely the bombers penetrated through the sewers. But I thought we sealed all the entrances well.}

### {252}{}{Oh no, we just started the fun. Now you will see the real power of the Old World!}
{252}{}{哦，不，我们刚开始玩。现在你将看到旧世界的真正力量！ -- Oh no, we just started the fun. Now you will see the real power of the Old World!}
### {253}{}{Don't, don't do this...}
{253}{}{不要，不要这样... -- Don't, don't do this...}
### {254}{}{It's worse for you, you idiot.}
{254}{}{这对你来说更糟，你这个白痴。 -- It's worse for you, you idiot.}

{255}{}{听我说，拉尔夫。一切从一开始就很糟糕。你被利用了。 -- Listen to me, Ralph. Everything was bad from the very beginning. You were used.}
### {256}{}{This is a mutually beneficial contract. Only fire worshippers could give the station a new life and revive a piece of the Old World. No one else had the knowledge and resources to do this. And old Theodore is just losing his mind. It's scary to think how this story will end under his leadership.}
{256}{}{这是一份互惠互利的合同。只有消防崇拜者才能赋予车站新的生命，让旧世界的一部分复活。没有其他人有这样的知识和资源。老西奥多正在失去理智。想想这个故事在他的领导下会如何结束，真是令人恐惧。 -- This is a mutually beneficial contract. Only fire worshippers could give the station a new life and revive a piece of the Old World. No one else had the knowledge and resources to do this. And old Theodore is just losing his mind.

### {261}{}{Another... Yes. Aaron is just using them to create an empire. I didn't think about it. But if you think about it... Damn it, what should I do? Go back to ruined California? Or go with the guys to the east? Who knows, maybe it will be possible to find oil in Texas or restore the old Chrysler Motors plants.}
{261}{}{另一个对亚伦只是利用他们来建立一个帝国。我没想过。但如果你想一想…该死，我该怎么办？回到被毁的加利福尼亚？还是和他们一起去东部？谁知道呢，也许有可能在得克萨斯州找到石油，或者恢复克莱斯勒汽车公司的旧工厂。 -- Another... Yes. Aaron is just using them to create an empire.

{264}{}{这是一个强有力的词。我要走了。和平地。告诉西奥多把警卫从门上移开。 -- That's a strong word. I'll leave. Peacefully. Tell Theodore to remove the guards from the doors.}

### {267}{}{What is this old man thinking about, letting a stranger into the very heart of the station? Okay, let's see. First, inspect the damage on the lower level. We will need materials and equipment for repairs. The easiest way to get them is at the tinsmith factory. It's somewhere to the south of the city, the caravaneers should know for sure.}
{267}{}{这个老人在想什么，让一个陌生人进入车站的中心？好吧，让我们看看。首先，检查下层的损坏情况。我们将需要材料和设备进行维修。拿到它们最简单的方法是在锡匠厂。它在城市南部的某个地方，房车司机应该肯定知道。 -- What is this old man thinking about, letting a stranger into the very heart of the station? Okay, let's see. First, inspect the damage on the lower level. We will need materials and equipment for repairs. The easiest way to get them is at the tinsmith factory.

### {276}{}{Isn't the church sponsoring you with uranium?}
{276}{}{教会不是在用铀赞助你吗？ -- Isn't the church sponsoring you with uranium?}
### {277}{}{That's not enough. Theodore doesn't let them go to the station's affairs, and without them, business is moving too slowly. At first it seemed like a purely technical matter - they took uranium and got energy from it. Now comes the time of the economy, business and taxes. Theodore does not understand anything about this and believes that it is enough just to sell energy left and right.}
{277}{}{这还不够。西奥多不让他们去处理车站的事务，没有他们，生意进展太慢了。起初，这似乎是一个纯粹的技术问题――他们从中提取铀并获得能源。现在是经济、商业和税收的时候了。西奥多对此一无所知，他认为仅仅左右出售能源就足够了。 -- That's not enough.
