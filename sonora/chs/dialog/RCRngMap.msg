### {100}{}{Here is a cartographer.}
{100}{}{这是一位制图师。}
### {101}{}{You see a ranger in free clothes with a large eyepiece on his forehead. It seems that the constant work at dusk has worsened his eyesight.}
{101}{}{你可以看到一个穿着免费衣服的护林员，额头上戴着一个大目镜。黄昏的持续工作似乎使他的视力变差了。}

### {200}{}{(In front of you is a frail-looking ranger; his uniform hangs on him like on a hanger, and an eyepiece with interchangeable lenses dangles on his head; when he sees you, he adjusts the lenses and winces, peering into your face) And? Who let you in? Only rangers can come here.}
{200}{}{（你面前是一个看起来很虚弱的护林员；他的制服像挂在衣架上一样挂在他身上，一个带可互换镜片的目镜挂在他的头上；当他看到你时，他会调整镜片并退缩，凝视着你的脸）然后呢？谁让你进来的？只有护林员才能来这里。}
### {201}{}{Don't worry, I'm allowed.}
{201}{}{别担心，我是被允许的。}

#Questions
### {220}{}{What are you doing here?}
{220}{}{你在这里干什么？}
### {221}{}{My job is to make new maps of the Wastelands. It's painstaking and very time-consuming.}
{221}{}{我的工作是绘制荒原的新地图。这是一项艰苦而耗时的工作。}
### {222}{}{What's wrong with old maps?}
{222}{}{旧地图怎么了？}
### {223}{}{They are becoming obsolete. Of course, the relief has hardly changed since the Great War, but some lakes and rivers have dried up, radioactive areas have appeared and new settlements have formed. Nowadays, only rangers and caravan drivers know the geography of the surrounding area in detail. But even our patrols sometimes need precise coordinates. And no one makes new maps... No one but me.}
{223}{}{它们正在变得过时。当然，自第一次世界大战以来，救济几乎没有改变，但一些湖泊和河流已经干涸，放射性区域已经出现，新的定居点已经形成。如今，只有护林员和大篷车司机才能详细了解周围地区的地理情况。但即使是我们的巡逻队有时也需要精确的坐标。没有人制作新地图...除了我，没有人。}
### {224}{}{What are you pointing at on these cards?}
{224}{}{你在这些卡片上指的是什么？}
### {225}{}{Everything that will be useful to our brother on the way: settlements, farms, outposts, radioactive areas, oases. And for the command center, any cartographic information can be useful at all.}
{225}{}{所有对我们兄弟有用的东西：定居点、农场、前哨站、放射性区域、绿洲。对于指挥中心来说，任何地图信息都是有用的。}
### {226}{}{Can I study your maps?}
{226}{}{我可以研究一下你的地图吗？}
### {227}{}{Only with the permission of a superior commander.}
{227}{}{只有得到上级指挥官的许可。}
### {228}{}{Yes, of course. We have no secrets among our own.}
{228}{}{是的，当然。我们之间没有秘密。}
### {229}{}{Do you have other duties besides cartography?}
{229}{}{除了制图，你还有其他职责吗？}
### {230}{}{They dump on me any job where you need to read and write.}
{230}{}{他们把你需要读写的任何工作都交给我。}
### {231}{}{Is that why you're always making those grimaces?}
{231}{}{这就是为什么你总是做那些鬼脸的原因吗？}
### {232}{}{Are you kidding? I've been dribbling over maps and texts in the semi-darkness for years. Therefore, without an eyepiece, I can hardly see anything... Damn, you know, if I'm forced to leave in the wastelands, it will be my last day in my life.}
{232}{}{你在开玩笑吗？多年来，我一直在半黑暗中翻阅地图和文本。因此，如果没有目镜，我几乎什么都看不见...该死，你知道，如果我被迫离开荒原，那将是我生命中的最后一天。}
### {233}{}{Why are you still here?}
{233}{}{你为什么还在这里？}
### {234}{}{Although the command center has been destroyed, this does not cancel my duties.}
{234}{}{尽管指挥中心已经被摧毁，但这并不能取消我的职责。}

#Quartz
### {250}{}{Commander Helford sent me to Quartz.}
{250}{}{赫尔福德指挥官派我去Quartz。}
### {251}{}{Really? Probably, the commander does not have enough people... I have long asked him to conduct geodetic measurements there.}
{251}{}{真正地也许，指挥官没有足够的人...我长期以来一直要求他在那里进行大地测量。}
### {252}{}{Come on, forget it.}
{252}{}{来吧，忘了它。}
### {253}{}{What can you tell me about this place?}
{253}{}{关于这个地方你能告诉我什么？}
### {254}{}{These are the old ruins of an ancient town. (shows on the map) For a long time after the Great War, they remained radioactive. Combined with the hot desert climate, this place scared off any settlers and travelers. Only recently has the radiation level dropped to an acceptable level. Therefore, we did not attach importance to these ruins until recently.}
{254}{}{这些是一座古老城镇的废墟。（显示在地图上）在大战后的很长一段时间里，它们仍然具有放射性。再加上炎热的沙漠气候，这个地方吓跑了任何定居者和旅行者。直到最近，辐射水平才降至可接受的水平。因此，我们直到最近才重视这些废墟。}
### {255}{}{I need to know more about Quartz.}
{255}{}{我需要了解更多关于Quartz的信息。}
### {256}{}{You don't have to continue.}
{256}{}{你不必继续。}
### {257}{}{Why was Quartz radioactive?}
{257}{}{为什么石英具有放射性？}
### {258}{}{Radiation was brought there by storms from the west, from California. Those lands were pretty battered by nuclear explosions during the Great War.}
{258}{}{辐射是由来自加利福尼亚州西部的风暴带来的。在第一次世界大战期间，这些土地遭受了核爆炸的严重破坏。}
### {259}{}{What dangers can I face there?}
{259}{}{我在那里会面临什么危险？}
### {260}{}{Residual radioactive background, radscorpions, collapses of dilapidated buildings... Overall Quartz has been a pretty quiet place so far.}
{260}{}{残留的放射性背景，放射性蝎子，破旧建筑的倒塌...总的来说，到目前为止，Quartz一直是一个相当安静的地方。}
### {261}{}{What measurements do you need to take?}
{261}{}{你需要测量什么？}
### {262}{}{I'm afraid it's too much work for one person: relief, radioactive background, condition of neighborhoods, vegetation...}
{262}{}{恐怕对一个人来说工作量太大了：救援、放射性背景、社区状况、植被...}
### {263}{}{My Pip-Boy has a built-in map sensor.}
{263}{}{我的皮普男孩有一个内置的地图传感器。}
### {264}{}{Really? Wow, then you're a real godsend for my work. I'll show you the positions for observations. Your task is just to go there and record the data.}
{264}{}{真正地哇，那你真是我工作的天赐之物。我会告诉你观察的位置。你的任务就是去那里记录数据。}
### {265}{}{Noted. I'll be back when I'm done.}
{265}{}{注意。我做完就回来。}
### {266}{}{I'm not going to waste time on any maps. But I need to know more about Quartz.}
{266}{}{我不会在地图上浪费时间。但我需要了解更多关于Quartz的信息。}
### {267}{}{Great! You will do this good service to all the Rangers.}
{267}{}{太棒了你会为所有的流浪者队做这件好事的。}
### {268}{}{OK, but I still have questions about Quartz.}
{268}{}{好的，但我对Quartz仍有疑问。}
### {269}{}{See you later.}
{269}{}{回头见。}
### {270}{}{Here are the Quartz measurements you needed.}
{270}{}{以下是您需要的Quartz测量值。}
### {271}{}{Unbelievable! There's more data here than I was hoping for! That thing on your arm just works wonders. You can use my cards as a reward. Thank you.}
{271}{}{难以置信的这里的数据比我希望的要多！你手臂上的那个东西真神奇。你可以用我的卡片作为奖励。非常感谢。}
### {272}{}{Please, I was glad to help the Rangers.}
{272}{}{拜托，我很高兴能帮助游骑兵队。}
### {1272}{}{Please, I was happy to help the Rangers.}
{1272}{}{拜托，我很高兴能帮助流浪者队。}
### {273}{}{It would be better to give cartridges, but it's not bad to raise your reputation either.}
{273}{}{给子弹会更好，但提高你的声誉也不错。}
### {274}{}{Why do you need the cards of this hole?}
{274}{}{你为什么需要这个洞的牌？}
### {275}{}{There's no need for them right now, but we have to be ready for anything. Mutant nests or bandit camps may be hiding in old ruins. After all, Quartz is the "gateway" to California. They may be sealed by the desert for now, but it's only a matter of time.}
{275}{}{现在不需要他们，但我们必须做好一切准备。变种人的巢穴或土匪营地可能藏在古老的废墟中。毕竟，Quartz是通往加州的“门户”。他们可能暂时被沙漠封印，但这只是时间问题。}
