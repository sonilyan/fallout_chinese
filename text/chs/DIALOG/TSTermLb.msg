#{214}{}{The aliens were humiliated in full. They were tested every week with various kinds of physical and biological impacts. As it turned out, the aliens are strong animals with huge military potential - one of them is capable to deal with a whole squad. Scientists tried to tame them for later use as a living weapon against enemies. However, while their combat potential was never in doubt, the taming part had failed.}
{214}{}{外星人受到了充分的羞辱。每周对它们进行各种物理和生物影响的测试。事实证明，外星人是强壮的动物，具有巨大的军事潜力――其中一个能够对付一整班人。科学家们试图驯服它们，以备日后用作对付敌人的活武器。然而，尽管他们的战斗潜力从未被怀疑，驯服部分却失败了。}
#{215}{}{Looks like they have no known weaknesses. The only damage type proven to be better than the others is fire. The only things that is somehow calming is that for reproduction these creatures require a special conditions: high radiation level, heated, moist environment, lack of light. Besides, females of the species are born one in a thousand, so the probability of the continuation of their kind is extremely small, and, sooner or later, the species should die out. Sounds good, except the life cycle of aliens is more than 70 years.}
{215}{}{看起来他们没有已知的弱点。唯一被证明比其他类型更好的伤害类型是火灾。唯一能让人平静下来的是，这些生物的繁殖需要特殊的条件：高辐射水平、高温潮湿的环境、缺乏光线。此外，该物种的雌性出生于千分之一，因此其延续的可能性非常小，迟早该物种会灭绝。听起来不错，只是外星人的生命周期超过70年。}
#{216}{}{That explains why the aliens are met across the wasteland usually in the dark: they see in heat vision, with focus on the speed of victim's movement. During the day they hibernate, as heated environment interrupts with the thermal sight, leading to aliens having harder time to navigate themselves. Considering this information, researchers undertook the development of a unique equipment piece - a corset, which could hide a thermal radiation of a human.}
{216}{}{这就解释了为什么外星人通常在黑暗中穿越荒原：他们在热视觉中看到，专注于受害者移动的速度。白天它们会冬眠，因为高温环境会干扰热视力，导致外星人很难自己导航。考虑到这一信息，研究人员开发了一种独特的设备――紧身胸衣，它可以隐藏人体的热辐射。}
#{217}{}{In the winter of 2077, some incident happened in the lab, when, due to the negligence of the employees, the experiment on female alien got out of control. Test subject slipped into the corridor. Apparently, these creatures are not stupid, as the mutant quickly assessed the environment and escaped through the vents into the desert. The military found traces in caves in the C sector, but didn17t risk the soldiers and blew up all exits. Six months later, the creature has reminded of itself again.}
{217}{}{2077年冬天，实验室发生了一起事故，由于工作人员的疏忽，女外星人实验失控。受试者溜进走廊。显然，这些生物并不愚蠢，因为变种人很快评估了环境，并通过通风口逃到了沙漠中。军方在C区的洞穴中发现了踪迹，但没有让士兵冒险，并炸毁了所有出口。六个月后，这个生物又恢复了自我。}
#{218}{}{The order of implementing of the force field system came after the incident in the winter of 2077. The military tried to maximize the protection from a test subjects. Apparently, they understood how they underestimated the capabilities of aliens. Further process was supervised by the commanding officers of A5 sector, together with maintenance department. So, maybe there's some information on the first level, about what happened to force fields and if they work now. In any case, it is known that the force barriers are impenetrable by aliens.}
{218}{}{在2077年冬天的那次事件之后，部队场系统的实施命令出台了。军方试图最大限度地保护受试者免受测试。显然，他们明白他们是如何低估外星人的能力的。进一步的过程由A5区的指挥官和维修部共同监督。所以，也许在第一层有一些信息，关于力场发生了什么，以及它们现在是否起作用。在任何情况下，我们都知道原力屏障是外星人无法逾越的。}

#{224}{}{As it turned out, scientists were pretty worried by the incident in the winter of 2077, when one of the aliens got loose. They made a decision to develop a powerful protection system for the time of experimentation. The key points in this system were a force fields and a gas protection. Deadly gas, that should have been used in extreme cases, was to be distributed throughout the whole levels, including the top of the hangar, through the vent. The management considered this decision reasonable, but very dangerous, therefore, requiring a multi-stage system of turning it.}
