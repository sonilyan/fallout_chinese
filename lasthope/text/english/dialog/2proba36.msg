{100}{}{What do you want? Stop wasting my time and speak!}
{101}{}{Who are you?}
{103}{}{Nothing.}
#
{104}{}{You better have something important this time.}
# who are you
{105}{}{We represent the "Falcon Brothers Corporation". We organize caravans and trading of goods.}
{106}{}{Corp... um nevermind. Have you been in Farmers Town lately?}
#
{107}{}{I think a couple of days ago, usual business... Why, are you lost or something?}
{108}{}{Somebody committed a robbery there. One of the locals claims he knows who's responsible, you happen to fit
 the description.}
{109}{}{Sorry, I'll have to be going.}
#accuse
{110}{}{How convenient, you had a hunch, is that right. Listen Sherlock, I'm tired of this detective crap. I'm a
 businessman and I also happen to know something about that robbery. Give me a fair offer and I'll tell you what I know.}
{111}{}{Hm... how much are we talking about?}
{112}{}{No deal. This is how it works, you tell me what I want to know and I let you live.}
#price
{113}{}{Lets say you give me $500 and I'll tell you everything.}
{114}{}{I don't like this but you got it. [Hand him $500.]}
{115}{}{I'll be back with the money.}
#let you live
{116}{}{You call that negotiating? Let me show you how we deal with strong-arming!}
{117}{}{Show me what you got.}
#
{118}{}{[Counts the money.] Alright. It was all planned. We were supposed to meet Gordon, the guy who hired us to
 do the job. Everything was going according to plan, we stole some stuff, but then things went downhill. While we were
 escaping from town, Gordon suddenly took the other way and ran into the forest, disappearing without a trace. He
 made us look like fools, with no money... nothing! From that day his fate was sealed. We are business, but we have
 good memory. One day we'll come across his ugly face again, and when that day comes, he'll get what he deserves.}
{119}{}{Huh, that Gordon is a real bastard you say?}
#
{120}{}{Goddamn right! And he's gonna pay for all the trouble he caused!}
{121}{}{I couldn't agree more. I'll be on my way.}
{122}{}{You are the one who's gonna pay. First, for robbing that old man and then for your own funeral!}
#
{123}{}{Just give me some caps and I'll tell you everything about that robbery.}
#
{124}{}{Son of a bitch will pay!}
{125}{}{If you find him, tell him he's dead!}
