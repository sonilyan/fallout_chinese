#{113}{}{Stay here and keep your mouth shut.}

{122}{}{好...我的真名是斯迈利，但这里的每一个奴隶都是按号码叫的...是 啊。}
#{123}{}{Two... Months... I guess... Or six... Or a year... I don't really know. Nobody keeps track of time here. No one really cares.}
{123}{}{两个...月...我想...或者六个...或者一年...我真的不知道。这里没人能记录时间。没人真的在乎。}
#{124}{}{Well, I was captured by raiders when I was reaching Vegas in search for happy life... Ha, that's funny... But I was lucky, unlike others, - I'm not the one they conduct experiments on... Only beaten and forced to work... Yeah.}
{124}{}{好吧，我在去维加斯寻找幸福生活的时候被袭击者抓住了...哈，真有趣...但我很幸运，不像其他人，-我不是他们做实验的那个人...只是被打被迫工作...是 啊。}
#{125}{}{Freedom? Well, with this... [shows the number burned on his forehead] The put a stigma to anyone. And it sticks for the rest of the life. So if I'd be free, no one will consider me for a human, everyone will drive me away, no one would offer me a job... So yeah.}
{125}{}{自由？嗯，有了这个...[显示他额头上烧焦的数字]这是给任何人的耻辱。它会持续一辈子。所以如果我自由了，没有人会认为我是人，每个人都会把我赶走，没有人会给我工作...所以是的。}
#{126}{}{So you're here... Sneaking or what? Wow! No one ever got here like this, yeah. Then I'll tell you this - here's not a bad place for me, actually. But food here is, like, really crappy... Maybe you have something to eat? I'd tell everything for pizza!}
{126}{}{所以你在这里...偷偷摸摸还是怎么了？哇！从来没有人像这样到过这里，是的。那我就告诉你-事实上，这里对我来说还不错。但这里的食物真的很糟糕...也许你有东西吃？为了比萨饼我什么都愿意说！}
#{127}{}{Alright, I'll get you some good food, but later. In the meantime, sit and wait.}
{127}{}{好吧，我会给你弄点好吃的，不过过会儿再说。与此同时，坐着等着。}
#{128}{}{Here, look and choose from these.}
{128}{}{来，看看，从这些中选一个。}
#{129}{}{Don't even count on it! I won't get you anything. Sit here tight.}
{129}{}{别指望了！我什么都不会给你。坐好了。}

{136}{}{谢谢！谢谢你，善良的人！我好久没这样吃东西了！双头牛的粪肥只对造风有好处，但这个。。哦-哦...}
#{137}{}{Uh, don't mention it... Now, let's talk about the lab.}
{137}{}{呃，别提了...现在，让我们谈谈实验室。}
#{138}{}{Well, this is the Pound - Here they make various drugs, then test them on slaves - on us... Yeah.}
{138}{}{好吧，这是英镑-这里他们制造各种毒品，然后在奴隶身上测试-在我们身上...是 啊。}
#{139}{}{Who runs the Pound?}
{139}{}{谁管理这个收容所？}
#{140}{}{What is this opposite building behind the paddock?}
{140}{}{围场后面对面的那栋楼是什么？}
#{141}{}{Is it possible to enter the main building undetected?}
{141}{}{有可能不被发现就进入主楼吗？}
#{142}{}{I don't need anything from you now. You can carry on.}
{142}{}{我现在不需要你的任何东西。你可以继续。}
#{143}{}{Well, it's... Nobody knows... He is a secretive person, no one sees how he enters and how quits. But I can tell you a secret - there's a secret passage in his office! Yup. But anyway - no one knows who he is.}
{143}{}{嗯，这是...没人知道...他是一个隐秘的人，没有人看到他是如何进入和退出的。但我可以告诉你一个秘密-他的办公室里有一条秘密通道！是的。但不管怎样，没人知道他是谁。}
#{144}{}{Production lab. They make all their drugs there, that's it.}
{144}{}{生产实验室。他们所有的药品都在那里生产，就这样。}
#{145}{}{Hm... 18-22 says: yes, if quietly! Yup. The patrolman walks around, so you can avoid him, and those at the door probably won't see if you go at night. Yeah. Still, it's, like, a big risk. But if you get to the office of the chief, then you can exit through secret passage. But I don't know where is it, and how to use it...}
{145}{}{嗯...18-22说：是的，如果安静的话！是的。巡警四处走动，这样你就可以避开他，门口的人可能看不到你晚上去不去。是 啊。不过，这是一个很大的风险。但如果你到了局长办公室，就可以通过秘密通道离开。但我不知道它在哪里，怎么用...}
#{150}{}{Now shut up and listen to me, pathetic slug: Either you'll tell me everything, or I'll smash you to the wall!}
{150}{}{现在闭嘴，听我说，可怜的鼻涕虫：要么你把一切都告诉我，要么我把你砸到墙上！}
#{151}{}{No-no-no! 18-22 don't want to be smashed to the wall! I'll tell! Tell everything! [starts crying]}
{151}{}{不，不，不！18-22不想被撞墙！我会告诉你的！把一切都说出来！[开始哭泣]}
#{152}{}{Stop crying, snot! Now pull yourself together and share everything valuable you know.}
{152}{}{别哭了，鼻涕虫！现在振作起来，分享你所知道的一切有价值的东西。}
#{1105}{}{What? I'm free now? That's news! Thanks, friend!}
{1105}{}{什么？我现在有空了？这是新闻！谢谢，朋友！}
