### {105}{}{Not much, since I moved here recently. My skills were requested because the local doctor, Jay, left town some time ago, only to turn out missing. From chatting with the locals, I figured this town has become a very dangerous place. I receive new patients almost too often, mostly victims of robbers or bandits. The good part is I have plenty of medical supplies so I can cure people in a rather short time but there are still too many of those who require medical attention. Of course, the most I can do here is treating light wounds, cuts, burns... But bone fractures for example, I have no other option but to send them to a hospital in Forth City. There they got all kinds of medical equipment.}
{105}{}{不多，因为我最近搬来了。我的技能是被要求的，因为当地的医生周不久前离开了小镇，结果却不见了。从和当地人的聊天中，我发现这个小镇已经变成了一个非常危险的地方。我经常接待新病人，大多是强盗或土匪的受害者。好的方面是我有足够的医疗用品，所以我可以在很短的时间内治愈病人，但仍有太多的人需要医疗护理。当然，我在这里能做的最多的就是治疗轻微的伤口、割伤、烧伤。。。但例如骨折，我别无选择，只能把他们送到福斯市的医院。在那里他们得到了各种各样的医疗设备。 -- Not much, since I moved here recently.
