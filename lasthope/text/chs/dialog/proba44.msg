 fella.]}
#response
{101}{}{Yes... um... I arrived recently. So tell me about this place. What do you do here?}
{102}{}{Hey hmm... [Scratches his head.] Don't really knowsh what... We have celebrationsh... [It shows he's a little
 bit drunk.] You know, we recently had a good catch. There were some hotshpurs at the Old Hotel. They were full of
 money and jewels... Man, that was my lucky day. One of them told ush that there is some hidden gold near the... near
 the hotel. What a fool... *hic*. He thought he was gonna make his life with the gold... [Hard laughter.] But there was
 no gold and no... no mercy for him... Hehe...}
{103}{}{Gold you say... Where did he say it was located?}
{104}{}{How should I *hic* know, but if there ish gold, nobody... nobody took it yet. Boss was very clear about that,
 he said... "Blah, blah, blah... I'm a fat motherfucker... Bring the gold to me and you'll get your cut... Blah, blah, blah!"
 Anyway, if I knew where the gold is... I would be sooo far away from here by now. Why are you interested... Do you
 know shomething?}
{105}{}{No, I'm only asking... Maybe I can help you find it.}
{106}{}{Tell you what, I got some *hic* work to do now... Come back anotha time and we'll talk, and of courshe...
 bring shome beer to the party! [He grins stupidly. Then falls asleep on the table.]}
{107}{}{You got it. Goodbye.}

{109}{}{Catch you later.}
{110}{}{No time to talk right now.}
{111}{}{Hey there, buddy.}
#
{112}{}{Hey, you're back and you have something to drink. Wanna share that drink with me? [He looks eagerly at
 your beer.]}
#
{113}{}{Sure thing. Here you go.}
{114}{}{No way man, this beer is mine.}
#
{115}{}{Thanks, ah... This is a good one. [Drinks the beer.]}
#
{116}{}{Wanna tell me that story about the hidden gold?}
{117}{}{Enjoy that one, see ya later.}
#
{118}{}{What gold? Oh, right, let me see... During our last action at the Old Hotel some blathering idiot told me this
 story. He said that his folks, when the war started, hid some gold in the well near the hotel... And people come, people
 go, but nobody ever checked the well! [He smiles.]}
#
{119}{}{So why didn't you?}
#
{120}{}{Are you kidding? Who's crazy enough to go down there? You may get trapped! Anyway, I don't believe
 there's any pre-war gold. Just a crazy, old man's tale, if you ask me.}
#
{121}{}{Thanks anyway.}
#
{122}{}{I'm parched.}
{123}{}{*chrr* *zzz* *chrrr*}
