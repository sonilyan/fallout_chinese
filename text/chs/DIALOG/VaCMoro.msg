#{100}{}{You see: Moreau.}
{100}{}{你看：莫罗。}
#{101}{}{You see Richard Moreau, the head doctor of Vault 8.}
{101}{}{你看Richard Moreau，8号保险库的主任医生。}
#{102}{}{Hurry up with the data, we'll talk later.}
{102}{}{快点把数据拿出来，我们稍后再谈。}
#{110}{}{[You see Dr. Moreau. He looks angry.] Finally. I was thinking about sending a guard after you.}
{110}{}{[你看到莫罗医生了。他看起来很生气。我在考虑派一个警卫来追你。}
#{111}{}{That's not necessary. Why are you so upset?}
{111}{}{那没必要。你为什么这么难过？}
#{112}{}{What?.. Forget it. Back to the task at hand: you already know that we are going outside. I can't exactly tell what awaits us out there, so be prepared for the worst. If we move swiftly and act together, everything should go nicely.}
{112}{}{什么？。。算了吧。回到手头的任务：你已经知道我们要出去了。我不能确切地说什么在等着我们，所以要做好最坏的准备。如果我们行动迅速，共同行动，一切都会很顺利。}
#{113}{}{What's our mission?}
{113}{}{我们的任务是什么？}
#{114}{}{We've recently lost radio contact with our surveillance monitors on the surface. Still, they should be recording data to a local backup. Your mission is to get a copy of those recordings manually, if that is still possible.}
{114}{}{我们最近失去了与地面监控系统的无线电联系。不过，他们应该将数据记录到本地备份中。如果可能的话，你的任务是手动获取这些录音的副本。}
#{115}{}{How would I do that?}
{115}{}{我该怎么做？}
#{116}{}{Take this empty holodisk. You'll see a slot for it on the monitor. Just plug it in and press "copy". The monitor will take care of the rest - that is, if it still works. Now give me your sensor. I'll mark the monitors' positions on your map, so it could be easier for you to find them.}
{116}{}{拿着这个空的全息光盘。你会在显示器上看到一个插槽。把它插上，然后按“复制”。如果它还能工作的话，监视器会处理剩下的部分。把你的传感器给我。我会在你的地图上标出监视器的位置，这样你就更容易找到它们了。}
#{117}{}{Okay, doctor Moreau, we're ready to go. Follow me.}
{117}{}{好了，莫罗医生，我们准备好了。跟着我。}
#{118}{}{Understood. I'll tell you when we're ready to leave.}
{118}{}{理解。我们准备好离开时我会告诉你的。}
#{119}{}{Yes?}
{119}{}{对？}
#{120}{}{When the team is ready, type the activation code into the access panel. And don't lose the holodisk!}
{120}{}{当团队准备就绪时，在访问面板中键入激活码。别把全息光盘弄丢了！}
#{121}{}{Fine.}
{121}{}{好的。}
#{122}{}{I'll tell you when we're ready to leave.}
{122}{}{我们准备好离开时我会告诉你的。}
#{123}{}{Wait, what are the rest of you going to do?}
{123}{}{等等，你们其他人打算怎么办？}
#{124}{}{I'm responsible for medical assistance, in case someone needs it. The guard will provide security. The other citizen will gather surface data with his portable monitor.}
{124}{}{我负责医疗救助，以防有人需要。警卫将提供安全保障。另一位市民将用他的便携式监视器收集地面数据。}
#{125}{}{Doctor, are you sure you're alright? You look stressed...}
{125}{}{医生，你确定你没事吗？你看起来很紧张。。。}
#{126}{}{You'd better keep your mouth shut. The Overseer gave you an order - that's all you should worry about right now.}
{126}{}{你最好闭嘴。监工给了你一个命令-这就是你现在应该担心的。}
#{127}{}{}
{127}{}{}
#{128}{}{}
{128}{}{}
#{129}{}{Look, I can't go! Maybe I17ll just go back inside?}
{129}{}{听着，我不能去！也许我会回去？}
#{130}{}{We can't go without you. It's too risky.}
{130}{}{我们不能没有你。太冒险了。}
#{131}{}{It's too risky to go at all! It can't be a coincidence that all the monitors stopped sending data at once. Who knows what's going on out there!?}
{131}{}{去太冒险了！所有的监视器同时停止发送数据，这不可能是巧合。谁知道外面发生了什么！？}
#{132}{}{Hmm... It might be for the best if you don't go. You could compromise the mission. Go back in the vault. I'll find someone to replace you.}
{132}{}{隐马尔可夫模型。。。如果你不去也许是最好的。你可能会破坏任务。回保险库去。我会找人代替你的。}
#{133}{}{Whew, thank you. You just saved my ass... [Abandon your mission]}
{133}{}{哇，谢谢你。你刚刚救了我。。。[放弃你的使命]}
#{134}{}{No... No, wait. I think I just needed to let that out. I'll go outside, I can do it. You can count on me.}
{134}{}{不。。。不，等等。我想我应该把它说出来。我到外面去，我能行。你可以相信我。}
