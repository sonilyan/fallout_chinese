{100}{}{You see: a local farmer.}
#
{101}{}{Hello, stranger.}
{102}{}{First time here?}
{103}{}{No rest for the poor.}
{104}{}{Crops are getting bigger.}
{105}{}{Work, work!}
{106}{}{Got any spare change?}
{107}{}{Geckos are very tasty if you cook them right.}
{108}{}{Ever tried sugar milk? It's very good.}
#
{109}{}{Why don't you go back to where you belong.}
{110}{}{I don't like you.}
{111}{}{You damn thief.}
{112}{}{You're gonna end up dead quick.}
#
{113}{}{So, you're the guy that's helping that old farmer?}
{114}{}{Yeah, I'm that guy. How do you know?}
#
{115}{}{I have known George for almost twenty years now. My father and him were best of friends. I'll be glad to
 help George. What are you helping him with?}
{116}{}{He needs a shovel for his garden.}
{117}{}{Hey, it's a good thing that you've told me, I might have one... Have to look for it.}
{118}{}{I'll wait.}
{119}{}{Oh, man! I can't believe it. Must have lent it to a friend. Hey, do you mind staying here for a minute? I'm
 going to my friend's to get the shovel. There are some drinks in the fridge, just wait here. [He goes to the front door.]}
{120}{}{OK, guess I'll just sit down. (Maybe help myself to a beer.)}
#
{121}{}{[He walks in, not very happy.] Uh... My neighbor told me that someone stole it from him. He barely has
 money for food, so you'll have to buy a new shovel. Good luck anyway, you're going to need it if you wanna find a
 shovel for old George.}
{122}{}{You're right about that. Good day.}
#
{123}{}{Any luck with that shovel?}
{124}{}{George is sure gonna be happy when you get him that shovel.}
#
{125}{}{You helped old George? Way to go, man.}
{126}{}{You're the man!}
{127}{}{Nicely done.}
{128}{}{Have a nice day.}
