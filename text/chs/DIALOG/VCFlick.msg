#{100}{}{It's Maurice.}
{100}{}{我是莫里斯。}
#{101}{}{You see a man in shades, behind which is, barely visible, brash and cunning eyes are seen.}
{101}{}{你看到一个男人在阴暗处，背后是，几乎看不见，傲慢和狡猾的眼睛看到。}
#{102}{}{Are you a local resident? If not, it is unlikely we have something to talk about.}
{102}{}{你是当地居民吗？如果没有，我们就不太可能有什么可谈的。}
#{103}{}{Don17t you dare fuck with me! I can smell these tricks from a mile away...}
{103}{}{你敢操我！我能从一英里外闻到这些诡计。。。}
#{110}{}{I saw you got the room on the third floor. Well, good choice - there is the tranquility and reliable protection.}
{110}{}{我看见你在三楼的房间。好吧，不错的选择-这里有宁静和可靠的保护。}
#{111}{}{Are you local resident too?}
{111}{}{你也是当地居民吗？}
#{112}{}{Well... You can say that. My name is Maurice. Nice to meet you... [looks around and starts whispering] Listen, I know why you're here. I see it in your eyes, what you want. Otherwise why would you be in this casino, right? If you need help, I17m at your service - I will get, what you came here for. Of course, for a reasonable price.}
{112}{}{好。。。你可以这么说。我叫莫里斯。很高兴认识你。。。听着，我知道你为什么在这里。我从你的眼睛里看到了，你想要什么。否则你为什么会在这个赌场，对吗？如果你需要帮助，我随时为你效劳-我会得到你来这里的目的。当然，价格合理。}
#{113}{}{What are you talking about?}
{113}{}{你在说什么？}
#{114}{}{Eh, no, that won17t do it. [calls you to the room and opens his jacket, to show the goods] All of these things will help you to ride Ms Fortune and own her in all positions. So, choose, if you have the money.}
{114}{}{呃，不，那不行。[把你叫到房间里，打开他的夹克，展示货物]所有这些东西都会帮助你驾驭福琼女士，让她在任何位置都拥有她。所以，选择吧，如果你有钱的话。}
#{115}{}{[Trade]}
{115}{}{[贸易]}
#{116}{}{No, thanks, I prefer the honest route.}
{116}{}{不，谢谢，我喜欢诚实的路线。}
#{117}{}{[Laughs] Honest? Well okay. But when the honesty will make anal slave out of you, remember about me.}
{117}{}{老实说？好吧，好吧。但是当诚实会让你变成肛门奴隶的时候，记得我。}
#{118}{}{Err, I'll try.}
{118}{}{呃，我试试看。}
#{119}{}{}
{119}{}{}
#{120}{}{I knew, you would come back. What do you need today?}
{120}{}{我知道，你会回来的。你今天需要什么？}
#{121}{}{Nothing.}
{121}{}{没有什么。}
#{122}{}{Good luck, friend.}
{122}{}{祝你好运，朋友。}
#{123}{}{[Walk away]}
{123}{}{[走开]}
#{130}{}{Listen, Maurice, you know, where I can make decent money here?}
{130}{}{听着，莫里斯，你知道的，我在这里能赚很多钱吗？}
#{131}{}{Well, besides gambling, I only can think of some old story about the treasure. And, if you17re good at bullshitting people, there is a chance to get to mayor17s office, they pay the most there.}
{131}{}{嗯，除了赌博，我只能想到一些关于宝藏的老故事。而且，如果你擅长拉屎的人，有机会去市长办公室，他们在那里付出最多。}
#{132}{}{Thanks. You said something about a treasure?}
{132}{}{谢谢。你说什么宝藏？}
#{133}{}{It17s an old story. After the war there was only one man that managed to win big at the casino. His name, I can17t remember, it doesn17t matter. By one theory, when he took his prize and walked outside, a group of head hunters followed him. But the son of a bitch was smart and he dropped the tail, in the darkness.}
{133}{}{这是一个古老的故事。战后只有一个人在赌场赢了大钱。他的名字，我不记得了，没关系。有一种说法是，当他拿着奖品走出去时，一群猎头跟着他。但那狗娘养的很聪明，在黑暗中掉了尾巴。}
#{134}{}{Next?}
{134}{}{下一个？}
#{135}{}{In the morning the man that was after him found him at a bar. He was covered in dirt, and he had only some change for the drinks in his pockets. When he knew, he could not escape, he shot himself, without telling, where he hid the treasure.}
{135}{}{第二天早上，在他后面的那个人在一家酒吧里发现了他。他身上沾满了泥土，口袋里只有一些零钱用来装饮料。当他知道，他无法逃脱，他开枪自杀，没有告诉，他把宝藏在哪里。}
#{136}{}{So I will have to dig through the whole Vegas, to find the stash.}
{136}{}{所以我得把整个维加斯都挖遍，才能找到藏匿处。}
#{137}{}{Exactly! That17s why nobody found it yet. But I won17t be surprised, if its buried in a place, where everyone can see it.}
{137}{}{确切地！所以还没人找到它。但我不会感到惊讶，如果它埋在一个地方，每个人都可以看到它。}
#{138}{}{Hmm, thanks for telling me.}
{138}{}{嗯，谢谢你告诉我。}
#{139}{}{[Smiles] Don17t mention it. But if you find the treasure, don17t forget to share with me a little, he-he.}
{139}{}{别提了。但是如果你找到了宝藏，别忘了和我分享一点，他说。}
#{140}{}{We'll see.}
{140}{}{我们拭目以待。}
#{150}{}{Maurice, friend, I need to earn money as soon as possible! Can you help?}
{150}{}{莫里斯，朋友，我要尽快挣钱！你能帮忙吗？}
#{151}{}{Help? Ha! I could find you a ghoul for anal pleasure, but to find money... Sorry, but if you can17t earn it, then you just have two ways, a robbery, or love with a whore named Fortuna.}
{151}{}{救命啊？哈！我可以给你找个食尸鬼来做肛交，但是为了钱。。。对不起，如果你赚不到钱，那你只有两种方法，抢劫，或者和一个叫福图纳的妓女相爱。}
#{152}{}{Who, with who?}
{152}{}{谁，和谁？}
#{153}{}{Stop it, you know, what I17m talking about. Come to any slot machines or croupier at the roulette table. You have a chance to become a millionaire... Or go into a deep minus. It's a risk, babe. All that can be done - is to reduce your chances of losing.}
{153}{}{别说了，你知道，我在说什么。来到轮盘赌桌上的任何老虎机或蹲点。你有机会成为百万富翁。。。或者进入一个深负。这很危险，宝贝。我们所能做的就是减少失败的机会。}
#{154}{}{How can I do that?}
{154}{}{我该怎么做？}
#{155}{}{[Sniff] Learn to play games for start. You think, it17s all about math? Oh no. Gambling skill - is just like, any other skill. You should take a sober look at the situation in the game, able to assess your chances, to be able to anticipate the opponent's turn. Damn important is the memory and a lot of other shit. Well, are you is interested in that, or you17re already shaking from a glance at the card table?}
{155}{}{[嗅嗅]先学会玩游戏。你觉得，都是关于数学的？哦，不。赌博技巧-就像任何其他技巧一样。你应该清醒地看待比赛中的形势，能够评估自己的机会，能够预见对手的轮到。他妈的重要的是记忆和其他很多东西。好吧，你是对此感兴趣，还是你一眼望着牌桌就已经发抖了？}
#{156}{}{You can teach me to play?}
{156}{}{你能教我玩吗？}
#{157}{}{Is there any other way more simple?}
{157}{}{还有其他更简单的方法吗？}
#{158}{}{Fuck, I told about the risks! Sure, you can take special cards and dice, but without certain skill you won17t be able to anything with them, or even worse end up in a body bag.}
{158}{}{妈的，我说了风险！当然，你可以使用特殊的卡片和骰子，但是如果没有特定的技能，你将不能用它们做任何事情，甚至更糟的是，你会被扔进尸袋。}
#{159}{}{Sure, a tempting offer, but I will try to do without these tricks. Take care.}
{159}{}{当然，这是一个诱人的提议，但我会尽量不耍这些花招。当心。}
#{160}{}{Can I teach? Damn, I was the one, that almost managed to play this casino! Sadly, at the last moment I started losing and I was left without anything. But Mr. Wallace appreciated my talent and allowed to stay in the casino without the right to play. So ...yeah, I can teach you few things, for 1,000$. Believe me, I will quickly pay off, if you play well.}
{160}{}{我能教书吗？妈的，我就是那个差点在赌场玩的人！可悲的是，在最后一刻我开始失败，我什么都没有留下。但华莱士先生很欣赏我的才华，他允许我呆在赌场里而没有玩的权利。所以…是的，我可以教你一些东西，只要1000美元。相信我，如果你打得好，我会很快还清的。}
#{161}{}{Here is my last money for the lesson! I17m counting on your talent, Maurice!}
{161}{}{这是我最后一笔钱！我指望你的才能，莫里斯！}
#{162}{}{[Maurice takes you to his room, and you spend all day at learning the right way to play cards. Of course, Maurice always won, but in the end you still managed to get a draw] You17re a good student. Pay no attention to failures. Sometimes they are sobering when success does blinds your eyes.}
{162}{}{[莫里斯把你带到他的房间，你整天都在学习打牌的正确方法。当然，莫里斯总是赢，但最后你还是设法和他平局了]你是个好学生。不要注意失败。有时候，当成功蒙蔽了你的双眼时，他们是清醒的。}
#{163}{}{Thanks , Maurice, it was an important lesson.}
{163}{}{谢谢，莫里斯，这是重要的一课。}
#{164}{}{Your gambling skill raised by 10%.}
{164}{}{你的赌博技巧提高了10%。}
#{1102}{}{Are you a local resident? If not, it is unlikely we have something to talk about.}
{1102}{}{你是当地居民吗？如果没有，我们就不太可能有什么可谈的。}
