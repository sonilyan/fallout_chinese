### {227}{}{Your subordinates aren't talkative either. Why so much anger towards people?}
{227}{}{你的下属也不爱说话。为什么人们如此愤怒？}

{231}{}{我曾经是一个像你一样的人。我记得我的感受――恐惧、仇恨和嫉妒。但造物主为我开辟了一条新的道路，我摆脱了人类的恶习。然后北欧人把造物主从我身边带走了。}

{232}{}{对不起，这个问题似乎让你很烦恼。我宁愿离开。}
### {233}{}{By the words "gave a new life" do you mean taking a mutagen?}
{233}{}{你所说的“赋予新生命”是指服用诱变剂吗？}
### {234}{}{The mutagen is part of a big ceremony. It lasts almost a year. I was preparing - fasting, meditating on the ruins, training my body and will. Mutagen will not be given to someone who does not deserve it.}
{234}{}{诱变剂是大型仪式的一部分。它持续了将近一年。我在做准备――禁食，在废墟上冥想，训练我的身体和意志。突变体不会给那些不配得到的人。}

### {246}{}{I thought you were supposed to be the coolest here.}
{246}{}{我以为你应该是这里最酷的。}
### {247}{}{Your valor is inspiring.}
{247}{}{你的英勇令人鼓舞。}
### {248}{}{Levi saves our souls. We have no future without him. Therefore, I serve him the same way I served my Creator. But you, normik, cannot understand our suffering.}
{248}{}{李维拯救了我们的灵魂。没有他我们就没有未来。因此，我服务他就像我服务我的创造者一样。但是你，诺米克，无法理解我们的痛苦。}

{253}{}{哈哈，你说得对，诺米克。尽管如此，你还是需要一些保护。给，拿着这把武器。}
### {254}{}{Microwave? This is one of Levi's developments. Will you teach me how to use it?}
{254}{}{微波炉这是李维斯的发展之一。你能教我怎么用它吗？}
### {255}{}{And you normies need to be taught everything. Okay, I'll show you... If you bring me a proper meal.}
{255}{}{你们这些正常人需要被教会一切。好的，我给你看...如果你给我带一顿像样的饭。}
### {256}{}{Okay, I'll look for something.}
{256}{}{好吧，我去找点什么。}

{263}{}{那我们就不要浪费时间了。我不想让你在训练中再次感到饥饿...}
### {264}{}{Great, but we'll do it a little later.}
{264}{}{很好，但我们稍后再做。}
### {265}{}{Actually, I'm not really interested in energy weapons. But this trunk is something. Show me how to handle heavy weapons!}
