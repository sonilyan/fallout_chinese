{650}{}{有很多选择。我们做伟大的双头牛牛排，美味无比的烤狗和豆子上的壁虎腿。牛排30块，吐司35块，腿40个。你要什么？}

#{853}{}{Weeee! Sleepy time!}
{853}{}{威伊！昏昏欲睡的时候！}
#{900}{}{If you haven't heard yet, us ghouls are a sort of unwanted kind of people in Sedit these days. Not that we'd been much more popular before, but recently their hatred's hit the roof and keeps rising. People steer way from Falcon's Flight like it was on fire and most of 'em would like it to just disappear. It's not easy for us.}
{900}{}{如果你还没有听说，美国僵尸是一种不受欢迎的人在塞迪特这些天。不是说我们以前更受欢迎，而是最近他们的仇恨达到了顶点，而且还在上升。人们从猎鹰的飞行中逃离，好像它着火了，大多数人都希望它消失。对我们来说不容易。}
#{901}{}{I can imagine it isn't. I want to ask something else.}
{901}{}{我可以想象不是这样。我想问点别的。}
#{902}{}{I understand. Good-bye, Rene.}
{902}{}{我理解。再见，雷内。}
#{950}{}{Sedit is a caravan town. We saw the slow rise of the caravan trading and now our caravans travel to all the noteworthy locations in the area. Most of the town limits are managed by the town council. They even established police corps to finally introduce some law and order. The only exception's Lost Town. That place is run by senor Rodriguez. He's a terrible scoundrel who can't stand us ghouls. You'd better be careful around him yourself.}
{950}{}{塞迪特是一个大篷车镇。我们看到商队贸易的缓慢增长，现在我们的商队前往该地区所有值得注意的地点。镇上的大部分界限都由市议会管理。他们甚至成立了警察部队，最终建立了一些法律和秩序。唯一的例外是迷失的城市。那地方是罗德里格斯先生管理的。他是个可怕的恶棍，受不了我们这些僵尸。你最好自己小心他。}
#{951}{}{I will. I have a another question.}
{951}{}{我会的。我还有一个问题。}
#{952}{}{Yeah, sure. I've got to go.}
{952}{}{是的，当然。我得走了。}
#{1000}{}{They came here from the Hub, a big city far to the west of Sedit.}
{1000}{}{他们是从塞迪特以西的一个大城市中枢市来到这里的。}
#{1001}{}{Why did they leave it?}
{1001}{}{他们为什么离开？}
#{1002}{}{The Hub? Can you tell me anything else about the place?}
{1002}{}{中枢市？你能告诉我这个地方的其他情况吗？}
#{1003}{}{Thank you. I have another question.}
{1003}{}{非常感谢。我还有一个问题。}
#{1004}{}{I've got to go. Good-bye, Rene.}
{1004}{}{我得走了。再见，雷内。}
#{1050}{}{It's a very sad story. The whole city was destroyed by a huge raid of the supermutants. They attacked it in big numbers and left no stone unturned. Those who were lucky enough to survive had no place to go back to. I've heard talk that some of them are trying to rebuild the place, but that's probably just a rumor. Most of the survivors moved here.}
{1050}{}{这是一个非常悲惨的故事。整个城市都被超级变种人的大规模袭击摧毁了。他们大举进攻，千方百计。那些幸运地活了下来的人没有地方可去了。我听说他们中的一些人正试图重建这个地方，但那可能只是谣言。大部分幸存者都搬到了这里。}
#{1051}{}{Why did they move to Sedit in particular?}
{1051}{}{他们为什么特别搬到塞迪特？}
#{1052}{}{Can you tell me more about this Hub?}
{1052}{}{你能告诉我更多关于这个中枢市的情况吗？}
#{1053}{}{I see. I want to ask something else.}
{1053}{}{我懂了。我想问点别的。}
#{1054}{}{I've got to go. Good-bye, Rene.}
{1054}{}{我得走了。再见，雷内。}
#{1100}{}{There were a lot of reasons. For one, Sedit was the most distant town they knew. Their caravans discovered it only a few years before the destruction of the Hub. They thought this would be the least likely place for supermutants to attack. And Sedit resembles the Hub in several ways, so moving out here wasn't that big a change for most people.}
{1100}{}{原因有很多。首先，塞迪特是他们所知道的最遥远的城镇。他们的商队在中枢市被毁前几年才发现了它。他们认为这是超级变种人最不可能攻击的地方。而且Sedit在几个方面与这个中枢市相似，所以搬出这里对大多数人来说并没有太大的改变。}
#{1101}{}{Can you tell me more about this Hub?}
{1101}{}{你能告诉我更多关于这个中枢市的情况吗？}
#{1102}{}{That makes sense. I have another question.}
{1102}{}{这是有道理的。我还有一个问题。}
#{1103}{}{I've got to go. Good-bye, Rene.}
{1103}{}{我得走了。再见，雷内。}
#{1150}{}{Sure I can, I used to live there for a long time myself. The Hub was always a place of commerce and caravans, even more than Sedit itself. It was an amazing place, a real oasis in the heart of the wasteland. I liked it there...}
{1150}{}{我当然可以，我自己也曾在那里住过很长时间。这个中枢市一直是商业和商队的聚集地，甚至比塞迪特本身还要多。这是一个神奇的地方，一个真正的绿洲在荒地的心脏。我喜欢那里。。。}
#{1151}{}{[Let Rene speak.]}
{1151}{}{[让雷内说出来。]}
#{1152}{}{I see, I have another question.}
{1152}{}{我明白了，我还有一个问题。}
#{1153}{}{I've got to go. Good-bye, Rene.}
{1153}{}{我得走了。再见，雷内。}
#{1200}{}{You know, I left the Hub a long time before the rest of the people around here. We left it with Mimi and Ivet back in the twenties, way back then. That's when they killed the governor of the Hub, a man named Angus and then chaos spread over the city. A group of merchants used the anarchy that was gripping the city to seize the water reserves and thus started a terrible war. The conflict destroyed everything we'd built and there were a lot of people who went after us just 'cause of the way we looked. In the end, we had to flee. We visited many places during our travels, until we finally settled in Sedit. We've been here for a long time, but... somehow, I still have that soft spot for the good old Hub.}
{1200}{}{你知道，我比这里其他人早离开中枢市很久了。我们在20多岁的时候把它留给了咪咪和艾薇特。就在那时，他们杀死了中枢市的长官，一个叫安格斯的人，然后混乱蔓延到整个城市。一群商人利用笼罩着城市的无政府状态夺取水源，从而发动了一场可怕的战争。冲突摧毁了我们建造的一切，有很多人因为我们的长相而追杀我们。最后，我们只好逃跑。我们在旅行中参观了许多地方，直到最后在塞迪特定居下来。我们已经在这里很久了，但是。。。不知怎么的，我仍然对这个好的旧中枢市有好感。}
#{1201}{}{I understand you. But why did the others leave it?}
{1201}{}{我理解你。但其他人为什么要离开呢？}
#{1202}{}{That's how it goes. I have another question.}
{1202}{}{事情就是这样。我还有一个问题。}
#{1203}{}{I've got to go. Good-bye, Rene.}
{1203}{}{我得走了。再见，雷内。}
#{1250}{}{Hello. What can I offer you this time?}
{1250}{}{你好。这次我能给你什么？}
#{1251}{}{I only wanted to ask you a few questions.}
{1251}{}{我只想问你几个问题。}
#{1252}{}{I'll have something to drink.}
{1252}{}{我要喝点东西。}
#{1253}{}{I'm hungry. What food do you serve?}
{1253}{}{我饿了。你们供应什么食物？}
#{1254}{}{I'm looking for a room to rent.}
{1254}{}{我在找一个房间出租。}
#{1255}{}{Nothing at all. Good-bye, Rene.}
{1255}{}{什么都没有。再见，雷内。}
#{1256}{}{Drrrink!}
{1256}{}{林克医生！}
#{1257}{}{Me bottle up!}
{1257}{}{把瓶子给我！}
#{1258}{}{Sleepy eyes!}
{1258}{}{昏昏欲睡的眼睛！}
#{1259}{}{Nuffin! Bye-bye.}
{1259}{}{努芬！再见。}
#{1300}{}{[Rene looks surprised.] You know... I have! The ghoul that's staying with us has one just like this. He crawled in here in the middle of a night, seriously wounded, on the edge of insanity. He just kept babbling something about succeeding and hoping that someone was finally dead. We gave him a room upstairs, even though he didn't have a single cap on him. Mimi's been trying to tend to his wounds ever since but he's getting no better. I guess he won't be around much longer. If you want to talk to him, you'll find him in the room at the end of the hall to the right. But I doubt he'll tell you anything useful. He's got to be stark mad from all that rambling.}
{1300}{}{[雷内看起来很惊讶]你知道。。。我有！和我们在一起的僵尸就有一个这样的。他半夜爬到这里，受了重伤，快疯了。他只是不停地唠叨着成功的事，希望有人最终死了。我们在楼上给了他一个房间，尽管他身上一顶瓶盖也没有。从那以后，咪咪一直在努力治疗他的伤口，但没有好转。我想他不会再多待了。如果你想和他说话，你会发现他在大厅尽头右边的房间里。但我怀疑他会告诉你任何有用的事情。他一定是被那些胡言乱语弄疯了。}
#{1301}{}{Well, maybe I'll be able to make him tell me something. I have another question.}
{1301}{}{好吧，也许我能让他告诉我一些事情。我还有一个问题。}
#{1302}{}{I'll try it. Thank you for your help, Rene.}
{1302}{}{我试试看。谢谢你的帮助，雷内。}
#{1350}{}{Fine, no problem. Just give me 5 caps and the room's all yours for a single day.}
{1350}{}{好吧，没问题。只要给我5顶瓶盖，房间一天就归你了。}
#{1351}{}{Deal. [Give him the caps.]}
{1351}{}{处理。[把瓶盖给他。]}
#{1352}{}{Maybe later. I'm looking for the answers to some questions, if you don't mind.}
{1352}{}{也许以后吧。如果你不介意的话，我在找一些问题的答案。}
#{1353}{}{I'm still not interested. Bye.}
{1353}{}{我还是不感兴趣。再见。}
#{1400}{}{[Rene sighs sadly.] That's bad news, though we should've expected it right from the start. You see, that ghoul crawled in here one night, seriously wounded and almost completely insane. He kept rambling something about succeeding and someone being finally dead. We gave him a room upstairs, even though he didn't have a single cap on him. Mimi had been trying to tend to his wounds ever since, though she must have known it wouldn't help. There was no way we could have saved that ghoul and he didn't want us to. I hope she won't blame herself for his death.}
{1400}{}{[雷内悲伤地叹了口气]这是个坏消息，尽管我们从一开始就应该预料到。你看，那个僵尸一天晚上爬到这里，受了重伤，几乎完全疯了。他不停地唠叨着成功的事，终于有人死了。我们在楼上给了他一个房间，尽管他身上一顶瓶盖也没有。从那以后，咪咪就一直试图抚平他的伤口，尽管她一定知道这样做无济于事。我们不可能救了那个僵尸，他也不想我们救。我希望她不要为他的死自责。}
#{1401}{}{I'm sure she'll deal with it. I have another question.}
{1401}{}{我相信她会处理好的。我还有一个问题。}
#{1402}{}{I hope she won't. Take care, Rene.}
{1402}{}{我希望她不会。保重，雷内。}
