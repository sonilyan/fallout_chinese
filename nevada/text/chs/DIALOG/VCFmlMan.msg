#{100}{}{You see Richard Pryor.}

{104}{}{现在，当我用一条腿站在舞台上时，我可以把另一条腿插进清洁城市的屁股里，然后用嘴把它拿出来。你能想象它是什么样子吗！？}

{201}{}{所以我要陪你去雷诺的舞台？}
#{202}{}{I didn't need you! I don't even want to talk to you.}
{202}{}{我不需要你！我甚至不想和你说话。}
#{203}{}{Reno's stage is calling for me, baby! But you are... By yourself... Didn't they have a security escort, or, at least, a stagecoach? Okay, okay, I'm going now, if it is time to.}
{203}{}{雷诺的舞台在召唤我，宝贝！但你是...你一个人...他们不是有保安护送，或者至少有驿站马车吗？好吧，好吧，我现在就走，如果是时候的话。}

#{205}{}{Wait, I should prepare for departing.}

{210}{}{我该怎么委婉地说...问题是，俱乐部的老板死了，现在你失业了。}
#{211}{}{What the fuck am I doing here then!? [looks around in confusion] What a shithole! [Sees homeless men around the barrel] Hey, guys! Want some company?.. [Goes to them and gets lost in the crowd, then a collective laughter is heard in the distance, eventually falling silent.]}
{211}{}{那我他妈的在这里干什么！？[困惑地环顾四周]真是个混蛋！嘿，伙计们！有人陪吗？。。[走近他们，在人群中迷路，然后远处传来集体笑声，最终沉寂。]}

#{250}{}{Tell me about your work.}
{250}{}{告诉我你的工作。}
#{251}{}{Look, I'm funny. People laugh at my jokes, like a crowd of morons. I was born for this. However, Vegas is already tired of me, so I stopped performing here. But I still have to eat, so I decided to try my luck in Reno.}
{251}{}{听着，我很有趣。人们对我的笑话一笑置之，就像一群白痴。我生来就是为了这个。然而，维加斯已经厌倦了我，所以我不再在这里表演了。但我还是要吃饭，所以我决定在雷诺碰碰运气。}
#{252}{}{You don't talk like a comedian right now...}
{252}{}{你现在说话不像个喜剧演员...}
#{253}{}{Fine.}
{253}{}{好的。}
#{254}{}{Well... You know, I have some heavy shit on my heart. I tell something important to people - and they don't listen. They think it's just a joke. But they listen to *you*. Because you're serious, even though you don't have much to say. You know what I'm saying?}
{254}{}{好...你知道吗，我心里有点烦。我告诉人们一些重要的事情-他们不听。他们认为这只是个玩笑。但他们听你的。因为你是认真的，尽管你没什么好说的。你知道我在说什么吗？}
#{255}{}{And what would you tell to people in Reno?}
{255}{}{你会对里诺的人说什么？}
#{256}{}{Just the same crap, I think. Nobody takes me seriously anyway. Besides, I can't do anything else. After all this fun on big stages for years, I can't just go back to something like digging through brahmin shit, you know what I'm saying?}
{256}{}{我想还是一样。反正没人把我当回事。再说了，我什么也做不了。在大舞台上玩了这么多年之后，我不能再回到像挖掘双头牛的东西上，你知道我在说什么吗？}

{300}{}{我他妈的在这里干什么！？}
#{301}{}{See No Evil, Hear No Evil}
{301}{}{不见恶，不闻恶}
#{302}{}{Dedicated to all those who took care of my cocaine}

#{306}{}{And everybody starts asking: what is it?! It's Richard Pryor running down the street!}
{306}{}{每个人都开始问：这是什么？！理查德・普赖尔在街上跑！}
#{307}{}{I thought, this is because of the straight hair. While they are like this, the white bully me around. And I burned them.}

#{1200}{}{Fans, fans... You didn't bring paparazzi with you, did you? Good enough.}
{1200}{}{粉丝们，粉丝们...你没带狗仔队，是吗？够好了。}
#{1254}{}{Well... You know, I have some heavy shit on my heart. I tell something important to people - and they don't listen. They think it's just a joke. But they listen to *you*. Because you're serious, even though you don't have much to say. You know what I'm saying?}
