### {200}{}{Wait, don't come near me! What are you doing here during curfew?}
{200}{}{等等，别靠近我！宵禁期间你在这里干什么？}
### {201}{}{I'm looking for a troublemaker who spoils the life of a local preacher. Hi there.}
{201}{}{我在找一个搅乱当地传教士生活的人。你好。}
### {202}{}{So you're in league with this sectarian. I don't want to see you! I'm going home. And don't you dare follow me.}
{202}{}{所以你和这个教派结盟了。我不想见你！我要回家了。你也不敢跟着我。}
### {203}{}{I don't think it's necessary.}
{203}{}{我认为没有必要。}
### {204}{}{Wait, let's go back a bit.}
{204}{}{等等，让我们回到过去。}

### {210}{}{What do you want from me?}
{210}{}{你想从我这里得到什么？}
### {211}{}{Don't mind me.}
{211}{}{别介意我。}
### {212}{}{How do you feel about the cult of the Sacred Fire?}
{212}{}{你对圣火崇拜有何感想？}
### {213}{}{I've never liked this cult. What kind of crazy idea is it to worship old things and some mythical Fire? Any normal person has more important things to do.}
{213}{}{我从来都不喜欢这种崇拜。崇拜古老的事物和神话中的火是什么疯狂的想法？任何一个正常人都有更重要的事情要做。}
### {214}{}{Isn't a preacher engaged in healing and teaching?}
{214}{}{传教士不是在从事治疗和教学吗？}
### {215}{}{Yes... if you properly appease him with a bunch of caps and then listen to idiotic nonsense. I can tell this nonsense about radiance, rent genes and other atoms for free myself. The whole church of the Sacred Fire consists of ordinary charlatans who help only for huge donations.}
{215}{}{对如果你用一堆瓶盖来安抚他，然后听愚蠢的废话。我可以告诉这些关于辐射的废话，免费租用基因和其他原子。整个圣火教堂都是由普通的江湖骗子组成的，他们只为巨额捐款而提供帮助。}
### {216}{}{I fully share your hatred for this stupid cult. What can we do?}
{216}{}{我完全赞同你对这个愚蠢邪教的憎恨。我们能做什么？}
### {217}{}{I'll have to leave you with your skepticism. Be there.}
{217}{}{我不得不把你的怀疑留给你。在那里。}
### {218}{}{Hmm-m. I don't know if I should believe you. But if you really want to cleanse the city of this filth, then one of two things - either we kill this sectarian, or the city will drive him away.}
{218}{}{嗯。我不知道我是否应该相信你。但如果你真的想清除这座城市的污秽，那么有两件事――要么我们杀死这个宗派主义者，要么这座城市会把他赶走。}
### {219}{}{How to do it?}
{219}{}{怎么做？}
### {220}{}{I don't even know, buddy. If we attack him in the open, then the city will not leave it so easily. Too many people in the colony believe his nonsense. We need to eliminate it quietly.}
{220}{}{我甚至不知道，伙计。如果我们在公开场合攻击他，那么这座城市就不会那么容易离开。殖民地里有太多人相信他的胡说八道。我们需要悄悄地消除它。}
### {221}{}{If you coax me well, then I will rid the city of the preacher.}
{221}{}{如果你哄得好，那么我就会把这个城市的传教士赶走。}
### {222}{}{The task requires time for reflection. I'll be back later.}
{222}{}{这项任务需要时间进行反思。我稍后回来。}
### {223}{}{They say your relatives were enslaved. Then you should know that the sectarian has blessed the mercenaries for this "God-pleasing" enterprise. Some of your relatives were taken away by other fire worshippers and taken somewhere out of the city. If this is not enough, then think about the medicines that the sectarian receives from the south. That's where the real "uranium vein" is, eh?}
{223}{}{他们说你的亲戚被奴役了。那么你应该知道，教派为雇佣兵的这一“讨上帝喜欢”的事业祝福。你的一些亲戚被其他拜火者带走，带到城外的某个地方。如果这还不够，那就想想教派从南方得到的药物吧。那才是真正的“铀矿脉”，嗯？}
### {224}{}{How glad I am to see you!}
{224}{}{见到你我真高兴！}
### {225}{}{Glad to see you.}
{225}{}{很高兴见到你。}
### {226}{}{Hiram tells my son's story at Sunday sermons. Nothing depends on me now.}
{226}{}{告诉在星期天的布道会上讲我儿子的故事。现在什么都不取决于我。}

### {230}{}{I want you to come to the temple and publicly confess what you have done.}
{230}{}{我希望你来到寺庙，公开承认你的所作所为。}
### {231}{}{Are you out of your mind? So I will turn the whole city against me.}
{231}{}{你疯了吗？所以我要让整个城市反对我。}
### {232}{}{Not if you pretend that now you also sympathize with the sect.}
{232}{}{如果你假装现在也同情这个教派，那就不会了。}
### {233}{}{Really, a stupid idea. Forget it.}
{233}{}{真的，一个愚蠢的主意。算了。}
### {234}{}{Nonsense! Why would I do that?}
{234}{}{胡说我为什么要那样做？}
### {235}{}{Your son will be saved. In addition, Hiram already knows who is behind the night diversions, and will not leave it so easily.}
{235}{}{你的儿子会得救的。此外，Hiram已经知道谁是夜间改道的幕后黑手，不会这么轻易离开。}
### {236}{}{Damn it... Well, you're right, there's nothing else I can do.}
{236}{}{该死……你说得对，我无能为力。}
### {237}{}{The cultist probably irradiated your brain. Leave me alone.}
{237}{}{邪教分子可能辐射了你的大脑。别管我。}
### {238}{}{Okay. But blame yourself.}
{238}{}{可以但是责怪你自己。}
### {239}{}{Hell, even away from Phoenix, you can't avoid these crazy fire worshippers... Okay, I'll talk to Hiram. I will try to establish a common language, but only to avoid conflict.}
{239}{}{地狱，即使远离凤凰城，你也无法避免这些疯狂的拜火者...好的，我和海勒姆谈谈。我将努力建立一种共同的语言，但只是为了避免冲突。}
### {240}{}{Great, keep it up.}
{240}{}{太好了，坚持下去。}
### {241}{}{The job is done - Hiram is no more.}
{241}{}{工作完成了――海勒姆不在了。}
### {242}{}{Ah-h, wonderful news. Now that this fanatic is gone, the city will get better. Take a hundred caps, you deserve them.}
{242}{}{啊，好消息。现在这个狂热分子走了，这座城市会变得更好。拿一百个瓶盖，这是你应得的。}
### {243}{}{What about your son's treatment?}
{243}{}{你儿子的治疗怎么样？}
### {244}{}{Hiram saved your son.}
{244}{}{海兰救了你的儿子。}
### {245}{}{Not bad. Later.}
{245}{}{不错。后来}

### {250}{}{Why are you trying to drive the priest away?}
{250}{}{你为什么要把牧师赶走？}
### {251}{}{An idiotic cult that brainwashes people and pulls the bottlecaps out of them is *already* a weighty reason. But there is another one - this is my son suffering from the effects of radiation.}
{251}{}{一个愚蠢的邪教给人们洗脑并把瓶子从他们身上拔出来，这已经是一个重要的原因了。但还有一个――这是我的儿子受到辐射的影响。}
### {252}{}{Sad story, let's change the subject.}
{252}{}{悲伤的故事，让我们换个话题。}
### {253}{}{Hiram refused to help you?}
{253}{}{Hiram拒绝帮你？}
### {254}{}{He demanded conversion to his faith. Not me, of course, but my son. He should become a servant of the temple, go to classes and morning prayers. Damn it. We moved away from these damned fanatics, and they still get into our personal life.}
{254}{}{他要求皈依他的信仰。当然不是我，而是我儿子。他应该成为寺庙的仆人，去上课和晨祷。该死。我们离开了这些该死的狂热分子，他们仍然进入我们的个人生活。}
### {255}{}{Even the caps don't help?}
{255}{}{连瓶盖都没用？}
### {256}{}{The local temple is just a branch of the main temple from Phoenix. They have caps above the roof. Therefore, Hiram has enough means to exist. It's more important for him to impose his stupid faith on the colonists. And he will stop at nothing.}
{256}{}{当地的庙宇只是凤凰城主庙的一个分支。他们在屋顶上有瓶盖。因此，Hiram有足够的生存手段。对他来说，把自己愚蠢的信仰强加给殖民者更为重要。他会不择手段。}
### {257}{}{I can help with the treatment if you let me.}
{257}{}{如果你允许的话，我可以帮忙治疗。}
### {258}{}{Really? I will be glad of any help and will pay with caps, just not to mess with this sect.}
{258}{}{真正地我会很高兴得到任何帮助，并会支付上限，只是不想惹上这个教派。}
### {259}{}{I managed to cure your son. Without resorting to the services of the church.}
{259}{}{我设法治好了你儿子。没有求助于教堂的服务。}
### {260}{}{Hiram cured your son as a sign of reconciliation.}
{260}{}{希兰治好了你的儿子，以示和解。}
### {261}{}{How glad I am! Thanks! Here, take 100 caps for services.}
{261}{}{我真高兴！谢谢这里，取100顶服务帽。}
### {262}{}{I'm not healing for the caps. Keep them and be happy.}
{262}{}{我不是在为瓶盖疗伤。留住他们，让他们快乐。}
### {263}{}{You're an incredible person. I'll tell everyone about your merits. Thanks again.}
{263}{}{你是个不可思议的人。我会告诉大家你的优点。再次感谢。}
### {264}{}{Please.}
{264}{}{请}
### {265}{}{Great, they compensate for the cost of medicines.}
{265}{}{太好了，他们补偿了医药费。}
### {266}{}{Thanks again.}
{266}{}{再次感谢。}
### {267}{}{You're welcome.}
{267}{}{不客气。}
### {268}{}{I'll see what I can do.}
{268}{}{我看看我能做些什么。}
### {269}{}{Damn sectarians! Don't think I owe you anything now. But I'll try not to bother the preacher anymore.}
{269}{}{该死的宗派主义者！别以为我现在欠你什么。但我会尽量不再打扰传教士。}
### {270}{}{That's agreed.}
{270}{}{同意。}
### {271}{}{What's the problem of finding a cure for radiation sickness?}
{271}{}{找到治疗辐射病的方法有什么问题？}
### {272}{}{Hiram receives medical supplies from the main temple in the south. There's nowhere else to get medicine. Only sometimes caravans deliver a small batch at inflated prices.}
{272}{}{希兰从南部的主庙接收医疗用品。没有其他地方可以买到药。只是有时大篷车会以虚高的价格运送少量货物。}
