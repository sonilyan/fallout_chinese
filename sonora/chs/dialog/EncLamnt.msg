### {200}{}{Who's here? Answer me! God, I hope you're not a figment of my imagination... N-don't touch the weeds! They are dangerous!}
{200}{}{谁在这儿？回答我！天啊，我希望你不是我想象中的虚构...不要碰杂草！他们很危险！}
### {201}{}{Okay, calm down.}
{201}{}{好吧，冷静下来。}
### {202}{}{I'm Lamont. I have a farm in the canyon. Well, it used to be a farm.}
{202}{}{我叫拉蒙特。我在峡谷里有一个农场。它曾经是一个农场。}

{213}{}{等一下。如果这些杂草有这么多问题，你为什么留下来？}
### {214}{}{Why... Well, out of curiosity. They don't behave like unusual tumbleweeds. So I watched them. But I did it for too long.}

{226}{}{第二天我去看了。但我甚至没有在地上找到一个洞。然后这些事件开始了。}
### {227}{}{Go on.}
{227}{}{继续}
### {228}{}{At first I didn't pay attention. It just seemed like the tumbleweed was bigger than usual. And then they began to behave as if they were alive. They wouldn't even let me leave the canyon-they blocked the road or clung to my legs when I tried to leave. I haven't tried since...}
{228}{}{一开始我没注意。看起来风滚草比平时大。然后他们开始表现得好像还活着。他们甚至不让我离开峡谷――当我试图离开时，他们挡住了路，或者抓住了我的腿。从那以后我就没试过...}
### {229}{}{Hmm.}
{229}{}{嗯。}
### {230}{}{Go away! You still have a chance to get out of here. Run while you can!}
{230}{}{走开！你还有机会离开这里。趁你能跑的时候跑！}
