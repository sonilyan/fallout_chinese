#{112}{}{[Her head snaps to look at you] What did you say to Colin?! Tell me!}
{112}{}{你对科林说了什么？！告诉我！}
#{120}{}{[She frowns] You again? If you want to waste someone's time, can't you find a beggar in the street? At least they have nothing better to do.}
{120}{}{又是你？如果你想浪费别人的时间，你就不能在街上找个乞丐吗？至少他们没有更好的事可做。}
#{121}{}{[She hurriedly stands up] Y-you? You work for... I mean, ah, what a nice surprise... If I'd known you were coming, I'd have cleaned up! And my hair's not usually such a mess, I promise! Ha-ha... Uh, how can I help you?}

{133}{}{我是雪莱，这是我丈夫科林。我们尽我们所能，在任何地方付账。我们没有什么值得烦恼的，所以不要。}

{134}{}{哦，我的一生。我丈夫以前住在雷诺的另一个地方，但我们结婚后他搬走了她。}

{140}{}{雪莱，你丈夫...他不是你生命中的第一个男人，是吗？}

{141}{}{你想说什么？科林和我幸福地结婚了！你不敢暗示我不是妻子！你以为我是什么，街上的妓女？}
#{142}{}{I'm sorry, I'm not trying to offend you. But you had husband before Colin, didn't you?}
{142}{}{对不起，我不是想冒犯你。但你在科林之前就有丈夫了，不是吗？}
#{143}{}{Woman, are you deaf, or just stupid? You had another husband, right?}
{143}{}{女人，你是聋了，还是傻了？你有另一个丈夫，对吗？}
#{144}{}{Oooh, touchy subject. I'll go let you cool off.}
{144}{}{哦，敏感话题。我去让你冷静一下。}
#{145}{}{We... Don't like to talk about Chris. He passed away a long time ago. Let's leave it at that.}

{151}{}{克里斯...我的克里斯...[她抬头看着你]但是-已经十年了！发生什么事了？他在哪？}
#{152}{}{Ask Colin. He pushed your husband into the sewer and closed the lid behind him. Chris has been trapped there ever since, eating rats to survive.}
{152}{}{问问科林。他把你丈夫推进下水道，关上了他身后的盖子。克里斯一直被困在那里，吃老鼠生存。}
#{153}{}{He's been trapped for ten years in the sewers beneath us.}
{153}{}{他被困在我们下面的下水道里十年了。}
#{154}{}{The sewers? You mean, all this time... [she suddenly stands up and slaps Colin across the face] You bastard! You rotten, fucking bastard! You told me he was dead! He was your friend, you - you - oh god, Chris! Chris!!! [she runs outside]}
{154}{}{下水道？你是说，一直以来...[她突然站起来扇科林耳光]你这个混蛋！你这个混蛋！你告诉我他死了！他是你的朋友，你-你-哦上帝，克里斯！克里斯！！！[她跑到外面]}
