{100}{}{I'm busy now.}
{101}{}{Sorry, sir.}
{102}{}{I must get down to business.}
{103}{}{All this paperwork...}
{104}{}{Hm... where's letter "A"?}
#
{105}{}{Hey, you helped Fred. I'm glad that someone did the job right. But there's something more important you must
 do now. You see, there's a water problem in this region. The residents of Golden Valley are not experiencing this yet,
 because we are covering their water losses with our own reserves, but...}
{106}{}{Let me guess... You are running low on water?}
#
{107}{}{Well, not quite... We have a different kind of problem. The water cleaning system is fully automated and it's
 using a water chip for the cleaning procedures. And that's where the problem starts: The water chip is very old and
 needs to be replaced.}
{108}{}{Where can I find a new water chip?}
{109}{}{Look woman! My job is to guard buildings, not to go on some holy quest looking for a water chip! That can
 only end in a vat of goo. (no idea, why I said that?)}
#prihvatio zadatak i vratio se...
{110}{}{Can I help you, private?}
{111}{}{About your water situation...}
{112}{}{Just a routine check, miss.}
#
{113}{}{Yes?}
{114}{}{I've brought this water chip, looks new enough. I'm sure it will do.}
{115}{}{I got this water chip. Here... take a look.}
#
{116}{}{This appears to be an upgraded model, but guess what... This damn thing is broken! There's a capacitor
 missing. [Shows you with her finger.] You got to get me one that works!}
{117}{}{It looks fine to me... but OK. Guess I'll have to visit somebody again.}
{118}{}{Get your own water chip, damn it!}
#
{119}{}{Get lost, incapable one!}
{120}{}{Your job is already taken.}
{121}{}{Just let me be.}
#
{122}{}{Did you find a functioning water chip!?}
{123}{}{I sure did, here you go.}
{124}{}{Nope. Not yet.}
#
{125}{}{Yes, this one will do... [Looking at you.] I'm sorry I was yelling at you earlier. This work makes me very
 nervous, lots of paperwork, you know? Thank you for your services, private. You may go back to your post now.}
{126}{}{Sure thing.}
#where can I find water chip?
{127}{}{Sorry, no clue. You'll just have to find it... It's old hardware, but still in use by most water systems. }
{128}{}{Thanks, I guess. I'm off to find the chip then.}
#
{129}{}{Hm... where's letter "A"?}
{130}{}{All this paperwork...}
{131}{}{I must get down to business.}
{132}{}{OK... This goes there...}
{133}{}{Signature looks good, where's that seal...}
{134}{}{Letter "B"... Here.}
{135}{}{Is it from "A" to "Z" or reversed?}
{136}{}{Uh... I need a break...}
