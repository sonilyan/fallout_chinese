{100}{}{State your business, private. Wait, I don't recall seeing you before, new here?}
{101}{}{Yes, sir, I'd like to sign up for duty, sir.}
{102}{}{No, sir, I've been here for some time. Just reporting back in.}
#sign in...
{103}{}{Sorry kid, we're at full capacity. Which means, no assignments for new recruits. If you don't have more
 questions, I would like to get back to my work.}
{104}{}{I'll be going now, sir.}
#again...
{105}{}{I told you, I'm very busy here. Is there anything I should know?}
{106}{}{Nothing sir, just a routine check.}
#checking...
{107}{}{Very well then. Carry on, private.}
{108}{}{Yes, sir.}
#
{109}{}{Very well then. Wait! [Looking at his papers.] Report to Dr. Fred, he needs someone to watch over his lab.
 This could be your best assignment yet, private, a good chance to leave an impression around here. Don't screw it up!
 Now, carry on, soldier.}
#dude not wearing metal armor...
{110}{}{Hey, why aren't you wearing your armor?}
{111}{}{I, uh... lost it, sir.}
{112}{}{Why should I wear it?}
{113}{}{What armor?}
#lost...
{114}{}{How the hell did you manage to lose your equipment!? Wait a minute... [Looking closely at you]... Who the
 hell are you and what are you doing here?!}
{115}{}{I'm new here, don't you remember me?}
#updated may 16.2010 WOW!!!
{116}{}{Don't worry, I won't be long... I'm just here to pick something up.}
{117}{}{Only trying to make a good impression, sir! Why do you have to spoil everything!}
#115
{118}{}{No! But I'll remember your last words! [Takes his gun.]}
{119}{}{Oh, is that how you want to play!?}
{120}{}{Yes, sir... go to hell, asshole!}
#112
{121}{}{That's rule number one... always wear protective gear! Don't you show up again like this, you... [Looking
 closely at you]... Who the hell are you and what are you doing here?!}
#113
{122}{}{[Sighs.] What a moron! This is a military base, we have rules here and you know it! State your name, private...}
{123}{}{I'm uh, new here...}
{124}{}{ }
{125}{}{.}
{126}{}{I can't remember my real name, maybe this can explain things. [Show him the prison tattoo]...}
{127}{}{My name is... [You shout.] Screw you, sir!}
#116
{128}{}{No, you're not! Guards, it's shooting practice!}
#117
{129}{}{[Sighs.] What a moron! You could have been a good soldier, but you're too smart for your own good. Guards,
 it's shooting practice!}
#123
{130}{}{Yes, I can tell... [looking closely at you] because I have never seen you before. So, [takes his gun] any last
 words?}
#125
{131}{}{Hm, I've heard about a guy with that name before... Sticking his nose where it doesn't belong. [Takes his gun.]
 This is your lucky day, kid! You won't feel a thing.}
{132}{}{Screw you, sir!}
#after 111; speech roll for arsenal permit
{133}{}{[He sighs.] Very well, private. Get your arse to the armory and back in gear. But do not, and I repeat, do not
 lose your gear ever again. Is that clear?! Now, move! On the double, one-two, one-two...}
#after 112; intelligence below 5 or failed speech roll for arsenal permit
{134}{}{[He stares at you for a second in disbelieve.] Was your mother a mutant?! Where do you think you are?
 Tanks. Bullets. Live firearms. Does any of that ring a fucking bell? You're in the army! Now get your fat, mutant
 dumb-ass to the armory and back in gear. And if I ever see you without gear again, a stray bullet will be the least of
 your problems. Out! [To the guard next to him.] Who on earth recruited this moron?}
{135}{}{[Leave.]}
