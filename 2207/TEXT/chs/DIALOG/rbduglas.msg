### {10}{}{[he looks just like his old weary military armor without any insignias -  his scraggly beard almost fully covers his thin face, one eye is a little googly because of an old scar, stretched from forehead to cheekbone. His hair, which definitely used to be black, now is mostly gray. He doesn't even look at you, when you come by, too busy with his drink.] Did you want something?}
{10}{}{[他看起来就像他那疲惫的旧军装，没有任何徽章-他那凌乱的胡子几乎完全遮住了他瘦削的脸，一只眼睛有点黏糊糊的，因为有一道从前额一直延伸到颧骨的旧伤疤。他的头发过去肯定是黑色的，现在大部分是灰色的。当你来的时候，他甚至都不看你一眼，因为你正忙于喝酒。]你想要什么吗？}
### {11}{}{Sorry to bother, but it's not often you see people of your kind in these places. I'm }
{11}{}{很抱歉打扰你，但你很少在这些地方看到你这样的人。我是}
### {13}{011}{.}
{13}{011}{。}
### {12}{999}{No, nothing. I was just walking by.}
{12}{999}{不，什么都没有。我只是路过。}


### {1001}{}{[nothing has changed since your last conversation. Except, maybe, he looks even more tired] Oh... You again?}
{1001}{}{[自从你上次谈话以来，一切都没有改变。除了，也许，他看起来更累了]哦。。。你又来了？}
### {101}{011}{Well, yeah. Forgive my intrusion, but I haven't met people of your kind before. I'm }
{101}{011}{嗯，是的。请原谅我的打扰，但我以前从未见过你这种人。我是}
### {99}{}{, by the way.}
{99}{}{顺便说一句}
### {102}{023}{I got your badge.}
{102}{023}{我拿到你的徽章了。}
### {103}{012}{I wanted to ask you about your adventures if you don't mind.}
{103}{012}{如果你不介意的话，我想问问你的冒险经历。}
### {98}{999}{Yeah. Hello... And goodbye.}
{98}{999}{是 啊你好再见。}
### {1002}{}{[seeing you, he raises the glass. The chain on his bracelet gives a metallic ringing] Cheers, man! What Douglas can do for you?}
{1002}{}{[见到你，他举起酒杯。手镯上的链子发出金属的铃声]干杯，伙计！道格拉斯能为你做些什么？}
### {104}{012}{I just wanted to hear stories about your travels around Radius.}
{104}{012}{我只是想听听你在Radius周围旅行的故事。}
### {105}{999}{I wanted to check up on you. Take care of yourself, Douglas.}
{105}{999}{我想看看你。照顾好你自己，道格拉斯。}
### {1003}{}{[For a moment, he stops polishing his weapon, and salutes you, not leaving the chair.] The big boss himself! What does Rainbow want from an old Seeker?}
{1003}{}{[一会儿，他停止打磨武器，向你致敬，没有离开椅子。]大老板自己！彩虹想从一个老探索者那里得到什么？}
### {106}{025}{How do you like the local hospitality?}
{106}{025}{你觉得当地的热情好客怎么样？}
### {107}{999}{Not yet. I'll leave you for now.}
{107}{999}{还没有。我暂时离开你。}
### {1004}{}{[he is digging through a ragged army bag. When you appear, he just carelessly nods] Hey, man. Sorry, won't share a drink with you - a little busy, you see.}
{1004}{}{[他正在挖一个破旧的军包。当你出现时，他只是漫不经心地点了点头]嘿，伙计。对不起，我不想和你一起喝酒了――你知道，有点忙。}
### {108}{025}{Going somewhere?}
{108}{025}{去哪儿？}
### {109}{999}{I won't bother you then.}
{109}{999}{那我就不麻烦你了。}
### {1005}{}{[seeing you, he gets lively] The most useful person in the Rainbow! Come! How's business, is everything alright? Your girls are the only ones who can comfort me in this rotten world. Apart from booze and the Drop, of course.}
{1005}{}{[看到你，他变得活泼起来]彩虹中最有用的人！来生意怎么样，一切都好吗？在这个腐朽的世界里，只有你的女儿们能安慰我。当然，除了喝酒和喝酒。}
### {1010}{023}{I got your badge.}
{1010}{023}{我拿到你的徽章了。}
### {1011}{011}{Yes, our girls are of the highest tier... Sorry, don't remember your name. My bad. It's very good to know people like you better.}
{1011}{011}{是的，我们的女孩是最高级别的。。。对不起，不记得你的名字了。我的坏。很高兴能更好地了解像你这样的人。}
### {1012}{012}{I found some spare time to listen to your stories about traveling around Radius.}
{1012}{012}{我找了一些空闲时间听你讲关于在Radius周围旅行的故事。}
### {1013}{999}{Well, we're always happy to have you in our establishment. Come by anytime.}
{1013}{999}{嗯，我们总是很高兴有你在我们的机构。随时来。}


### {110}{}{Douglas. [he chuckles, but his eyes look just as indifferent as before] And what "kind" are you talking about, may I ask?}
{110}{}{道格拉斯。[他笑了笑，但他的眼睛看起来和以前一样冷漠]我可以问一下，你在说什么“善良”吗？}
### {111}{012}{Well... You look like an experienced traveler who has been through a lot. And stayed in one piece. Considering that I'm often walking around the Radius myself, my interest is pretty clear.}
{111}{012}{好你看起来像一个经历了很多的有经验的旅行者。并保持完整。考虑到我自己经常在Radius周围散步，我的兴趣很明显。}
### {112}{024}{I mean, the kind of lame clowns, who put some armor on them and think that there's no one better in the whole world, except the Olympus itself. Let's put it like this - you tell me who are you and what are you doing here, and I let you leave this place without any problems. Mostly.}
{112}{024}{我的意思是，那种跛脚小丑，他们穿上一些盔甲，认为除了奥林匹斯山本身，整个世界上没有比这更好的了。让我们这样说吧――你告诉我你是谁，你在这里做什么，我让你毫无问题地离开这个地方。主要地}


### {120}{}{[he shrugs, rolling empty vial of Drop around the table] Yes, I've been places. The Seeker who stays in one place for too long is going to die from hunger... Just like I am in this dump. [coarsely laughs]}
{120}{}{[他耸耸肩，在桌子周围滚动着一小瓶空的滴剂]是的，我去过很多地方。在一个地方呆太久的探索者会饿死的。。。就像我在这个垃圾堆里一样。[粗鲁地笑]}
### {121}{013}{Seeker? Is this your job?}
{121}{013}{探索者这是你的工作吗？}
### {122}{014}{Can you tell me about the places where you have been?}
{122}{014}{你能告诉我你去过哪些地方吗？}
### {123}{021}{Hmm... And I wanted to ask if you have some work for me.}
{123}{021}{嗯…我想问你有没有工作要做。}
### {124}{999}{I see. I hope that we could have a talk before it happens.}
{124}{999}{我明白了。我希望我们能在事情发生之前谈一谈。}


### {130}{}{[his laugh gets filled with hysterical notes] A job... Yeah... Everyone thinks that in the beginning - all you need is to rummage through some ruins, get yourself full pockets of stuff, and then live happily ever after. The thing is - you can't leave. You can't do anything about it. And nothing will help to cope, not booze, nor whores. Only the Drop - but not for long... [he shakes head and empties the whole glass in one gulp] Bullshit aside, we are looking for the old tech, trying not to die in the process from something contagious, bullets, claws, or radiation. Or something else.}
{130}{}{[他的笑声充满了歇斯底里的音符]一份工作。。。是 啊每个人都认为，一开始，你所需要的就是在废墟中翻找，把自己装满口袋，然后从此幸福地生活。问题是――你不能离开。你对此无能为力。除了酗酒和嫖娼，什么都无济于事。只有滴滴答答，但不会太久。。。[他摇摇头，一口气倒空了整个杯子]废话不说，我们正在寻找旧的技术，尽量不在这个过程中死于传染性的东西，子弹、爪子或辐射。或者其他什么。}
### {131}{014}{Very interesting. Can you tell me about the places you visited recently?}
{131}{014}{非常有趣。你能告诉我你最近去过哪些地方吗？}
### {132}{021}{Do you need any help in your... Search?}
{132}{021}{你的…需要帮助吗。。。搜索}
### {133}{999}{Thanks for the info. I need to go.}
{133}{999}{谢谢你提供的信息。我得走了。}


### {140}{}{[he rubs his neck, covered with old burns] Well, lately I've been walking the route between bar and whorehouse back and forth. I doubt you are interested in this... You know, I'm not very used to talk with my mouth dry.}
{140}{}{[他揉了揉脖子，脖子上满是旧烧伤]嗯，最近我一直在酒吧和妓院之间来回走动。我怀疑你是否对此感兴趣。。。你知道，我不太习惯口干舌燥地说话。}
### {141}{015}{No problem! Take a ten, get yourself a drink.}
{141}{015}{没问题！拿十，给自己拿杯饮料。}
### {142}{024}{So, you have been bending my ear all this time, only to ask for some change? Seeker, my ass! I bet you sought only around local dumpsters!}
{142}{024}{所以，你一直在听我说话，只是为了要求一些改变？探索者，我的屁股！我打赌你只在当地的垃圾箱附近找！}
### {143}{999}{You know, I don't have time for this. See you later.}
{143}{999}{你知道，我没有时间。回头见。}


### {150}{}{[he takes a long gulp] Oh shit, that's good... Okay, what do you want to hear about? Do you know about the Dead River? There's an old cryogenic lab just nearby. Such an interesting place... No one knows what sleeps in there, seeing dreams in eternal cold... And what would happen if it wakes up. But you can't get there easily - the Sunset Jackals are guarding the passage. I managed to get through once, but that way is closed now. }
{150}{}{[他大口地喝了一口]哦，妈的，太好了。。。好吧，你想听听什么？你知道死河吗？附近有一个旧的低温实验室。这么有趣的地方。。。没有人知道里面睡着什么，在永恒的寒冷中看到梦想。。。如果它醒了会发生什么。但你不可能轻易到达那里――日落豺狼队正在守卫通道。我设法通过了一次，但那条路现在已经关闭了。}
### {151}{016}{Okay, go on.}
{151}{016}{好的，继续。}
### {152}{999}{Enough of the tales by the campfire. Bye!}
{152}{999}{篝火旁的故事够多了。再见}


### {160}{}{So I had to find another way out. Bumped into a couple of Ferals, almost got torn to pieces... Needed to lay low somewhere, stumbled onto a house. And this house turned out to be not so simple. I tried the basement - and there was a whole military bunker! The kind of where I found myself this suit [knocks on his armor with a fist]. You can easily get a good gun in such a place. Still, this bunker is now occupied by some dirty raiders. Slick bastards, I barely got away. They gave me a souvenir [he puts away his hair and you see that part of his ear is missing] Maybe I'll return there later...}
{160}{}{所以我不得不另辟蹊径。撞上了几个弗勒尔，差点被撕成碎片。。。需要躺在某个地方，跌跌撞撞地发现了一所房子。事实证明，这所房子并不那么简单。我试过地下室，那里有一整座军事掩体！我发现自己穿着这套衣服的地方[用拳头敲他的盔甲]。在这样的地方你很容易就能买到一把好枪。尽管如此，这个掩体现在还是被一些肮脏的袭击者占领了。卑鄙的混蛋，我几乎没能逃脱。他们给了我一个纪念品[他收起头发，你看他的耳朵不见了]也许我稍后会回来。。。}
### {161}{017}{Is that it?}
{161}{017}{就是这样吗？}
### {162}{999}{I see. I better go, while I'm still not sleepy.}
{162}{999}{我明白了。我最好趁我还不困的时候走。}
### {163}{016a}{A military bunker? Ha! Every guy I meet is always telling me about some secret places...}
{163}{016a}{军事掩体？哈我遇到的每个人都会告诉我一些秘密的地方。。。}

### {164}{}{You are too young to tell for sure what's true and what's not. In any case, here are the coordinates. Your responsibility. I would advise you to get some Resistanol, or you won't make it out of there alive.}
{164}{}{你还太年轻，不能确定什么是真的，什么不是。无论如何，这里是坐标。你的责任。我建议你去买些雷司他诺，否则你活不下去了。}
### {165}{999}{We'll see about that. If this place exists.}
{165}{999}{我们拭目以待。如果这个地方存在的话。}
### {166}{017}{I'll definitely check it out. What else can you tell me?}
{166}{017}{我一定会去看看的。你还能告诉我什么？}

### {170}{}{[he stops to take another gulp] But the most interesting things were in a destroyed town to the south-east of Olympus. My theory is this - when the war started, locals managed to get into catacombs. They tried to settle there... Except nature is a bitch, and it had darkness and radiation to put against their hand-made shelters. So, they changed. Now they can easily smell you a hundred feet away - but their skin is thinner than a condom, I'm telling you! You look at one - and see what he had for breakfast! Well, maybe I'm exaggerating a little, but still pretty close. You can pierce them with a finger, hehe... This is exactly what I did when trying to get a sample... But that's another story, not for your ears. }
{170}{}{[他停下来又喝了一口]但最有趣的事情发生在奥林巴斯东南部一个被毁的小镇上。我的理论是，当战争开始时，当地人设法进入地下墓穴。他们试图在那里定居。。。除了大自然是一个婊子，它有黑暗和辐射来对抗他们手工制作的庇护所。所以，他们改变了。现在他们可以很容易地在一百英尺外闻到你的味道――但我告诉你，他们的皮肤比避孕套还薄！你看一看，看看他早餐吃了什么！嗯，也许我有点夸张，但还是很接近。你可以用手指刺穿它们，呵呵。。。这正是我在尝试获取样本时所做的。。。但这是另一个故事，不适合你听。}
### {171}{018}{Yeah, you see a lot of strange stuff around Radius... What about here? What are you doing here?}
{171}{018}{是的，你在Radius周围看到了很多奇怪的东西。。。这里呢？你在这里干什么？}
### {172}{999}{Thank you for telling me all this, but I need to go.}
{172}{999}{谢谢你告诉我这一切，但我得走了。}


### {180}{}{[he leans forward, looking into your eyes] Why do you care? I'm so sick of you all! I am just relaxing here, alright?}
{180}{}{[他前倾，看着你的眼睛]你为什么在意？我真讨厌你们！我只是在这里放松，好吗？}
### {181}{019}{You are right, that's not my business. But the folks around here are pretty suspicious. And here you are, who knows for what... Is it really such a big secret? I mean, you don't look like someone on an important mission, no offense.}
{181}{019}{你说得对，那不关我的事。但是周围的人都很怀疑。你来了，谁知道呢。。。这真的是个大秘密吗？我的意思是，你看起来不像一个执行重要任务的人，无意冒犯。}
### {182}{019}{Is that so? I was just thinking about giving you a discount, for our regular customer...}
{182}{019}{是这样吗？我只是想给你一个折扣，为我们的老客户。。。}
### {183}{019}{Really? So when I find you your badge, you act like I'm your best buddy, but when I ask a simple question -  you tell me to fuck off?}
{183}{019}{真正地所以当我找到你的徽章时，你表现得好像我是你最好的朋友，但当我问一个简单的问题时――你告诉我滚蛋？}
### {184}{024}{Either you tell me, or I'm putting you to eternal relaxation!}
{184}{024}{要么你告诉我，要么我让你永远放松！}
### {185}{999}{To hell with you then, nervous one. Relax further.}
{185}{999}{让你见鬼去吧，紧张的一个。进一步放松。}


### {190}{}{[he strokes his hair and pulls away from a new ampoule of the Drop from his pocket] For fuck's sake... [pops it into his mouth] Okay. In general, I'm working for Olympus... For my all damn life. I had the assignment to gather some things for them. I even have a list with me [pats his bag]... But they will have to wait. I'm a little tired...}
{190}{}{[他抚摸着头发，从口袋里掏出一安瓿新的滴剂]看在他妈的份上。。。[往嘴里塞]好的。总的来说，我在奥林巴斯工作。。。为了我那该死的一生。我的任务是为他们收集一些东西。我甚至还带了一份清单[拍拍他的包]。。。但他们将不得不等待。我有点累。。。}
### {191}{020}{Why didn't you tell me this earlier?}
{191}{020}{你为什么不早点告诉我？}


### {200}{}{Do I have to answer to someone here? And then, that old Apothecary prick has already convinced himself that I'm a spy, or something worse. And he tells it to everyone. I could care less about this Rainbow... What I'm trying to say is that no one would believe you. Best-case scenario, they tell you... To fuck off, and in... The worst-case...  I'm so sick of it... [looks like the Drop kicks in] This Olympus... can go fuck itself... Let them handle this shit, fucking smart-asses... I'm done... [he drops his head on his arms and stops talking]}
{200}{}{我必须回答这里的人吗？然后，那个老药剂师已经说服了自己，我是一个间谍，或者更糟的事情。他把这件事告诉了每个人。我可以不那么在乎这彩虹。。。我想说的是没有人会相信你。他们告诉你，最好的情况是。。。去他妈的，在…最坏的情况下。。。我受够了…（看起来像是水滴开始了）这座奥林匹斯山。。。可以去他妈的自己。。。让他们来处理这些混蛋。。。我完了。。。[他把头垂在胳膊上，不再说话]}
### {201}{999}{Ahem... Well, okay, see you around.}
{201}{999}{啊。。。好吧，回头见。}


### {210}{}{Yeah, I could use some help. I lost my badge somewhere around here. Most likely, it happened when I decided to warm up in the Arena. A pity - this thing is like memorabilia to me...}
{210}{}{是的，我需要一些帮助。我把徽章丢在这里的某个地方了。最有可能的是，这发生在我决定在竞技场热身的时候。遗憾的是，这件事对我来说就像纪念品。。。}
### {211}{022}{And why can't you look for it yourself?}
{211}{022}{为什么你不能自己找呢？}


### {220}{}{Because locals don't like me much. Everybody suspects that I'm up to something, morons... If I'd start searching for something, it would bring more questions. And, to be completely honest, I'm too lazy to carry my ass all around the Rainbow. Besides, one little whore promised to come to visit me soon... You get it. So, would you help?}
{220}{}{因为当地人不太喜欢我。每个人都怀疑我在搞什么，白痴。。。如果我开始寻找一些东西，它会带来更多的问题。而且，老实说，我太懒了，不敢在彩虹周围到处乱跑。此外，一个小妓女答应很快来看我。。。你明白了。那么，你能帮忙吗？}
### {221}{999}{Okay... Let's see what I can do.}
{221}{999}{可以让我们看看我能做些什么。}
### {222}{999}{Nah, not interested. Try the "Lost and Found" box, I have no time for this.}
{222}{999}{不，不感兴趣。试试“失物招领”盒子，我没有时间做这个。}


### {230}{}{[he looks a bit confused] You know... Somehow, I spent all of my cash on local hookers and booze. But I remember the favors! Tell me if you need something. I know a lot of people... So, will you give it to me?}
{230}{}{[他看起来有点困惑]你知道。。。不知怎么的，我把所有的钱都花在了当地的妓女和酒上。但我记得这些恩惠！如果你需要什么，告诉我。我认识很多人。。。那么，你能把它给我吗？}
### {231}{999}{Sure, take it. This was an easy job. But someday I'm going to remind you about your words.}
{231}{999}{当然，接受它。这是一项简单的工作。但总有一天我会提醒你注意你的话。}
### {232}{024}{Are you out of your fucking mind, trash man? Trying to screw me over? I'll shove this badge up your ass! }
{232}{024}{你疯了吗，垃圾人？想骗我？我要把这个徽章塞到你屁股上！}


### {240}{}{[He stands up and straightens his shoulders] Booze, whores, the Drop... and stupid meat, who doesn't know when to shut up. I love this place!}
{240}{}{[他站起来挺直肩膀]Booze，妓女，Drop。。。和愚蠢的肉，谁不知道什么时候该闭嘴。我喜欢这个地方！}
### {241}{998}{You are going to be sent to a local cemetery!}
{241}{998}{你将被送往当地的墓地！}


### {2501}{}{[he gets some weapon parts off the table and puts a bottle in their place] Can't complain. The Rainbow is becoming a pretty good place to have fun, with you in charge. I like it. [he nods to weapon parts] Don't mind this, just my habit of keeping things in order. The cost of mistake for a Seeker is very high... }
{2501}{}{[他把一些武器零件从桌子上拿下来，放了一个瓶子在他们的位置上]不能抱怨。彩虹正在成为一个非常好的地方，有你的负责，玩得很开心。我喜欢。（他向武器零件点点头）别介意，只是我习惯于把东西整理好。探索者犯错的代价是非常高的。。。}
### {251}{999}{Not only for a Seekers, you know. Okay, see you around.}
{251}{999}{你知道，这不仅仅是为了一个探索者。好吧，回头见。}
### {2502}{}{[he shoves his bag under a table] Just taking inventory. But everything can happen. Rainbow nowadays is not the coziest place for an old Seeker like me... And I have a job to do.}
{2502}{}{[他把包塞到桌子下面]只是在盘点。但一切都有可能发生。对于像我这样的老探索者来说，彩虹现在不是最舒适的地方……我还有工作要做。}
### {252}{999}{Well then, good luck to you, Douglas.}
{252}{999}{那么，祝你好运，道格拉斯。}
