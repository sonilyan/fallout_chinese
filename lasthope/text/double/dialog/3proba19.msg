### {103}{}{Later.}
{103}{}{后来 -- Later.}
### {104}{}{Walls, walls, that's all I can tell you. Memories of the outside world faded away over time. There's just this place, [he looks around] - that?s all I can remember.

{104}{}{墙，墙，这就是我能告诉你的全部。随着时间的推移，外界的记忆逐渐消失。就在这个地方，[他环顾四周]-那个?这就是我所能记得的。我在这里住了很多年。。。失去了时间感。我所做的就是日以继夜地看着过去，这种情况一直持续下去。[叹气。]至少他们对囚犯照顾得很好，不能抱怨。 -- Walls, walls, that's all I can tell you.

{107}{}{这是一个很好的故事，让我问你一些其他的问题。 -- That's a nice story, let me ask you something else.}
### {108}{}{Wait, why would I do such a thing? I got everything here, even a sense that I belong somewhere. This is the closest to living that I remember from a long time ago.

You never know when a drunk guard is gonna beat the hell out of you or some crazy addict tries to rob you in your sleep, just think about it.}
{108}{}{等等，我为什么要做这样的事？我在这里得到了一切，甚至有一种归属感。这是我记忆中最接近生活的一次。荒原上的生活教会了我如何通过索取他人来生存。我们有了进展。我和我的伙伴们提供保护，当然只需支付少量费用。你永远不知道什么时候一个喝醉的警卫会把你打得落花流水，或者某个疯狂的瘾君子试图在你睡觉时抢劫你，想想看。 -- Wait, why would I do such a thing?

{111}{}{事情发生的那天晚上我在牢房里。但据我所知，我的几个朋友试图这样做。现在，我说朋友是因为我们都住在同一个监狱里。不管怎样，那真是一场灾难。。。其中一个先走了，越过了栅栏。另外四个人设法在他身后消失在夜色中。但在那一刻，一些疯子触发了警报。其他囚犯都没有机会逃跑。真遗憾，那只是一次机会。。。 -- Well, I was in my cell the night it happened.

{118}{}{[不看就数钱。]好吧，这是我所知道的。。。顺便说一句，你的表演糟透了。。。稍后谢谢我。有五个人。。。马，杰夫，丁戈和德克斯。当然，另一个最先逃跑的家伙。。。这个叫马安的家伙是个杀手，如果你愿意的话，他是个有偿杀手。他夺走了多少生命，只有上帝知道。关于杰夫，我真的不太了解，他不在我的圈子里。。。我听说他是恐怖分子什么的。。。 -- [Counts the money without looking at it.] Alright, here's what I know...

### {120}{}{Then there was this troublemaker, Dingo. A thief, he used to beat up people for money and stuff, not very clear what's going on in his head.
