#{100}{}{You see a villager.}
{100}{}{你看到一个村民。}
#{101}{}{You see a gloomy citizen of Gerlach wearing dirty clothes.}

#{102}{}{You don't belong here.}
{102}{}{你不属于这里。}
#{103}{}{This doesn't concern you.}
{103}{}{这与你无关。}
#{104}{}{Keep moving.}
{104}{}{继续前进。}
#{105}{}{This is none of your business.}
{105}{}{这不关你的事。}
#{106}{}{Don't get in the way.}
{106}{}{别挡道。}
#{107}{}{Kill him!}
{107}{}{杀了他！}
#{108}{}{What are you doing here?}
{108}{}{你在这里干什么？}
#{109}{}{}
{109}{}{}
#{110}{}{I've got nothing to say to you, outsider. Talk to Gerlach, he's in charge here.}
{110}{}{我没什么好说的，局外人。和杰拉克谈谈，他是这里的负责人。}
#{111}{}{What can you tell be about this place?}
{111}{}{你能告诉我这个地方的情况吗？}
#{112}{}{Where and who is Gerlach?}
{112}{}{杰拉克在哪里？是谁？}
#{113}{}{What do you think about the executions?}
{113}{}{你对死刑怎么看？}
#{114}{}{Great, I'll talk to him.}
{114}{}{太好了，我会和他谈谈。}
#{115}{}{We look out for each other here. If you're not with us, you'd best be moving on.}
{115}{}{我们在这里互相照顾。如果你不在我们身边，你最好还是继续前进。}
#{116}{}{He founded this place. He lives in that house to the south-west.}
{116}{}{他建立了这个地方。他住在西南的那所房子里。}
#{117}{}{I'm not in the mood to talk about that. If you must know, then no, I don't like seeing them, but we don't have a choice. The wasteland's a cruel place.}
{117}{}{我没心情谈那件事。如果你一定要知道的话，那么不，我不想看到他们，但我们别无选择。荒地是个残酷的地方。}
#{118}{}{He's dead. I don't know if we'll make it without him.}
{118}{}{他死了。我不知道没有他我们能不能成功。}
#{119}{}{Oh, it's you! It's good to see you around here again. Can I help you with something?}
{119}{}{哦，是你！很高兴再次在这里见到你。我能帮你做点什么吗？}
#{120}{}{I'm just passing by.}
{120}{}{我只是路过。}
#{121}{}{Gerlach's gone. We'll probably be following him soon enough.}
{121}{}{杰拉克走了。我们很快就会跟踪他的。}
#{122}{}{That was so stupid!! How are we going to live without our leader? Get the hell out of here!}
{122}{}{太蠢了！！没有我们的领袖我们怎么生活？滚出去！}
#{123}{}{Fine, I'm going.}
{123}{}{好吧，我去。}
#{124}{}{Would you like to move somewhere safer?}
{124}{}{你想搬到更安全的地方吗？}
#{125}{}{Safer than this? In a heartbeat. Why?}
{125}{}{比这更安全？一瞬间。为什么？}
#{126}{}{Then congratulations on being the first to move to our vault!}
{126}{}{恭喜你第一个来到我们的保险库！}
#{127}{}{Oh, no reason. Just thinking out loud.}
{127}{}{哦，没有理由。只是大声思考。}
#{128}{}{Vault? As in, Vault-Tec? Where?}
{128}{}{拱顶？在保险库里？在哪里？}
#{129}{}{Just a few days north.}
{129}{}{就在北边几天。}
#{130}{}{[You notice other villagers gathering around you] And we can just live there? What's the catch?}
{130}{}{[你注意到其他村民聚集在你周围]我们就可以住在那里？有什么问题吗？}
#{131}{}{The catch is, if you accept, you can never come back.}
{131}{}{问题是，如果你接受了，你就再也回不来了。}
#{132}{}{[The villagers look at each other] Why should we believe you?}
{132}{}{[村民们对视]我们为什么要相信你？}
#{133}{}{I fixed your water pump. The vault has far more advanced technology.}
{133}{}{我把你的水泵修好了。避难所的技术要先进得多。}
#{134}{}{Without Gerlach, it's your only chance.}
{134}{}{没有杰拉克，这是你唯一的机会。}
#{135}{}{If I helped Steve, why wouldn't I help you?}
{135}{}{如果我帮了史蒂夫，我为什么不帮你？}
#{136}{}{Uh... Well, I can't really prove it, but it really is better than this place! I pinky swear!}
{136}{}{Uh...嗯，我真的不能证明，但它真的比这个地方好！我发誓！}
#{137}{}{Prove it. We've got no reason to trust you.}
{137}{}{证明一下。我们没有理由相信你。}
#{138}{}{Take a look at by Pip-Boy. These were only given to vault dwellers.}
{138}{}{看一下皮普男孩的作品。这些只给了地下室的居民。}
#{139}{}{Then I've got no reason to help you. Your loss.}
{139}{}{那我就没理由帮你了。你的损失。}
#{140}{}{He did earn a little respect, didn't he? [the crowd shouts in agreement] Okay, we'll do it. We've got nothing to lose, anyway. This place can't hold out forever.}
{140}{}{他确实赢得了一点尊重，不是吗？[群众一致喊叫]好的，我们来做。反正我们没什么可失去的。这个地方不可能永远存在。}
#{141}{}{Great!}
{141}{}{太好了！}
#{142}{}{How do we know you didn't take it off a body? Better yet, why shouldn't we take it off yours?}
{142}{}{我们怎么知道你没有从尸体上取下来？更好的是，我们为什么不把它从你的身上取下来呢？}
#{143}{}{Come on, would I lie to you? Fine, maybe you'll change your mind later.}
{143}{}{拜托，我会骗你吗？好吧，也许你以后会改变主意。}
#{144}{}{I've heard of these, but I've never seen one. If these are given to everyone in the vault, then I agree! [the rest of the crowd mumbles in approval]}
{144}{}{我听说过，但从没见过。如果这些都给了避难所里的每个人，那我同意！[其余的人咕哝着表示赞同]}
#{145}{}{Of course!}
{145}{}{当然！}
#{146}{}{We have plenty of food and water. You'll never go hungry or thirsty again.}
{146}{}{我们有足够的食物和水。你再也不会饥渴了。}
#{147}{}{I've heard enough! You've got yourself a new neighbor, buddy!}
{147}{}{我听够了！你有新邻居了，伙计！}
#{148}{}{Great!}
{148}{}{太好了！}
#{149}{}{Oh, food and water, I've never heard *that* one before. Yeah, right! I don't buy it.}
{149}{}{哦，食物和水，我从没听说过。是的，对！我不相信。}
#{150}{}{Don't believe me? That's too bad. Take care.}
{150}{}{不相信我？那太糟糕了。当心。}
#{151}{}{He's right! [everyone nods] Yes, we could try. You've shown you can be trusted.}
{151}{}{他是对的！是的，我们可以试试。你已经证明你是可以信任的。}
#{152}{}{Great!}
{152}{}{太好了！}
#{153}{}{You may have fixed the pump, but that doesn't prove you can be trusted. What if this is all a big trick?}
{153}{}{你可能已经修好了泵，但这不能证明你是可信的。如果这都是个大把戏呢？}
#{154}{}{Well, think about it. Maybe you'll change your mind later.}
{154}{}{好吧，好好想想。也许你以后会改变主意。}
#{155}{}{Who knows? Steve hasn't been here long, we don't know him too well. Maybe you saved him for some reason we don't know about. Why should we trust you?}
{155}{}{谁知道呢？史蒂夫来的时间不长，我们不太了解他。也许你救他是因为我们不知道的原因。我们为什么要相信你？}
#{156}{}{You don't trust me? Ouch. Maybe I can do something to fix that.}
{156}{}{你不相信我？哎哟。也许我能做点什么来解决这个问题。}
#{157}{}{Yeah, and you killed him! How do we know you won't do the same to us?}
{157}{}{是啊，你杀了他！我们怎么知道你不会对我们做同样的事？}
#{158}{}{It's true. Without Gerlach, this place won't survive. [villagers whisper to each other in agreement] I believe you, outsider. What other choice is there?}
{158}{}{这是真的。没有杰拉克，这个地方就活不下去了。[村民们互相耳语表示同意]我相信你，局外人。还有别的选择吗？}
#{159}{}{We're all adults here, we can survive without Gerlach. But you, outsider - you haven't given us much reason to trust you yet.}
{159}{}{我们都是成年人，没有杰拉克我们可以生存。但是你，局外人-你还没有给我们太多的理由相信你。}
#{160}{}{When we are heading out?}
{160}{}{我们什么时候出发？}
#{161}{}{I'll go back to the vault and tell them you're ready. Wait for someone to come get you.}
{161}{}{我回保险库告诉他们你准备好了。等着有人来接你。}
#{162}{}{You've convinced the community to move to Vault. All that's left is to report to Sergeant Stark.}
{162}{}{你说服了社区搬到保险库。剩下的就是向斯塔克中士报告。}
#{163}{}{We'll wait. But don't even think of betraying our trust. We can still hold guns in our hands.}
{163}{}{我们等着。但别想背叛我们的信任。我们还可以拿着枪。}
#{164}{}{Of course, just wait!}
{164}{}{当然，等等！}
#{165}{}{We've been waiting for your people. Where the hell are they? We're not going to sit around forever.}
{165}{}{我们一直在等你的人。他们到底在哪里？我们不会永远坐在一起。}
#{1120}{}{I'm just passing by.}
{1120}{}{我只是路过。}
#{1128}{}{Vault? As in, Vault-Tec? Where?}
{1128}{}{拱顶？在保险库里？在哪里？}
#{1133}{}{I fixed your water pump. The vault has far more advanced technology.}

#{1140}{}{She did earn a little respect, didn't she? [the crowd shouts in agreement] Okay, we'll do it. We've got nothing to lose, anyway. This place can't hold out forever.}
{1140}{}{她确实赢得了一点尊重，不是吗？[群众一致喊叫]好的，我们来做。反正我们没什么可失去的。这个地方不可能永远存在。}
#{1147}{}{I've heard enough! You've got yourself a new neighbor, missy!}
{1147}{}{我听够了！你有新邻居了，小姐！}
#{1150}{}{Don't believe me? That's too bad. Take care.}
