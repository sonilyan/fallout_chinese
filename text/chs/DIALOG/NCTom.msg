#{125}{}{Piss off, you're not getting anything from me!}

#{130}{}{You're welcome.}

#{136}{}{What do you know about this place?}

#{137}{}{What's behind that fence?}

#{138}{}{Have you ever seen the owner of this ranch?}

#{139}{}{How did you end up like this?}
{139}{}{你怎么会变成这样？}
#{140}{}{I've heard enough.}
{140}{}{我听够了。}
#{141}{}{[He draws a big circle with his hands] A ranch! It's enormous! They make food here - the most important thing in this world.}
{141}{}{[他用手画了一个大圆圈]一个牧场！太大了！他们在这里制造食物――这是世界上最重要的东西。}
#{142}{}{This is the home of a great man. He owns this ranch and lives here with his family, guards, slaves, and brahmin. Oh, he guards it carefully... Step inside, and they'll shoot you on sight, unless you're one of their own!}
{142}{}{这是一个伟人的家。他拥有这个牧场，和他的家人、守卫、奴隶和婆罗门住在这里。哦，他小心地保护着它。。。进去，他们一看到你就会开枪，除非你是他们自己人！}
#{143}{}{Ohh, there's not many like him in Reno. A tough nut, for sure - but do you know how nuts spoil? Not from the outside, no, but from within!}
{143}{}{哦，里诺没有多少像他这样的人。当然是个硬汉，但你知道坚果是怎么变质的吗？不是从外面，不是，而是从里面！}
#{144}{}{Me? Oh, wanderer, what could interest you in an old hobo like me? I was born from dust, I live by dust, and one day soon I will return to dust. They'll forget me then, but not yet - sometimes the guards come by and ask me to bring something into or out of the city. Easier than sending a slave or a guard, yes?}
{144}{}{我？哦，流浪汉，你对我这样的老流浪汉有什么兴趣？我生在尘土中，活在尘土中，总有一天我会回到尘土中。那时他们会忘记我，但现在还不会――有时卫兵会过来让我带些东西进城或出城。比派一个奴隶或守卫容易，是吗？}
#{145}{}{I see. Let me ask you something else.}
{145}{}{我懂了。我再问你一件事。}
#{146}{}{No more questions for now.}

#{1118}{}{It came down into our pockets, amiga.}
{1118}{}{它掉到了我们的口袋里，阿米加。}
#{1121}{}{If you say so...}
