### {209}{}{Why are you looking for the owner?}

### {212}{}{Why not? After all, things got really bad in Phoenix after that monstrous explosion.}

{225}{}{嗯。或者你只是假装是他的亲戚来代替他的位置？}

{262}{}{从乱葬岗来看，这里死了很多人。你知道这件事吗？}
### {263}{}{Hmm. As far as I know, clan wars have been waged here recently. That's why the locals get nervous when you try to ask them about the past. If my uncle fell victim to this war, then it remains only to accept.}
{263}{}{嗯。据我所知，最近这里发生了部族战争。这就是为什么当你试图询问当地人的过去时，他们会感到紧张。如果我的叔叔成为这场战争的受害者，那就只能接受了。}
### {264}{}{Will you leave with nothing?}
{264}{}{你会一无所有地离开吗？}
### {265}{}{Well, no. The bathhouse belonged to my uncle. And I am his relative. Shouldn't I inherit it?}

{266}{}{你在开玩笑吗？在所有这些威胁之后，你会留下来吗？}
### {267}{}{You see... To be honest, things weren't going well in Phoenix either. I was completely desperate, trying to earn caps on the fights. But here you can revive my uncle's business and get rich. Why the hell should I miss my chance?}
{267}{}{你看。。。老实说，菲尼克斯的情况也不太好。我完全绝望了，试图赢得比赛的上限。但在这里你可以重振我叔叔的生意并致富。我为什么要错过机会？}
### {268}{}{Ah, that's it. The death of your relative was very convenient, wasn't it?}
{268}{}{啊，就是这样。你亲戚的死很方便，不是吗？}
### {269}{}{What are you talking about? I can revive my uncle's business and get rich. It would be stupid to miss such a chance.}

### {271}{}{You have to be absolutely desperate to take such a risk.}
{271}{}{你必须不顾一切地冒这样的风险。}

{272}{}{现在最重要的是赢得市长的好感。他不想和我联系，警卫不让他进来。你能和他谈谈吗？}
### {273}{}{And what will I get for this mediation?}
{273}{}{这次调解我能得到什么？}
### {274}{}{And, of course, everyone wants to make money. Don't worry, I'll pay when I get rich. We're partners. We just have to wait a bit.}
{274}{}{当然，每个人都想赚钱。别担心，我有钱的时候会付钱的。我们是合作伙伴。我们只需要等一等。}

{278}{}{一想到要和这个暴君说话，我就害怕。找其他人吧。}
### {279}{}{I understand. It's okay, I'll figure it out somehow. Anyway, thanks for the help.}
{279}{}{我理解。没关系，我会想办法的。不管怎样，谢谢你的帮助。}
### {280}{}{Bye, loser.}
{280}{}{再见，失败者。}
### {281}{}{I'm just passing through here, I don't have time to wait for the first customers.}
{281}{}{我只是路过这里，没有时间等第一批顾客。}

### {308}{}{The mayor demands that you leave the city. Immediately.}
