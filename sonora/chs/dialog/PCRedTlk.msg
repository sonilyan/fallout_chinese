### {102}{}{I could use your armor.}
{102}{}{我可以用你的盔甲。}
### {103}{}{Ratting? Come here, we have a conversation.}
{103}{}{发出嘎嘎声？过来，我们聊一聊。}
### {104}{}{Stay away from me, little rat.}
{104}{}{离我远点，小老鼠。}
### {1104}{}{Stay away from me, rat.}

### {106}{}{Murphy is waiting for you in the arena.}
{106}{}{墨菲在竞技场等你。}

### {200}{}{Hey, rat. Be careful. I don't want to get dirty about you.}
{200}{}{嘿，老鼠。小心。我不想弄脏你。}
### {201}{}{Come on, Murphy. We're going to do a lot of things together.}
{201}{}{来吧，墨菲。我们要一起做很多事情。}
### {202}{}{Don't count on it. Unlike Orris, I'm not that trusting.}
{202}{}{别指望，我不像欧里斯那样信任别人。}
### {203}{}{Yeah. Bye, Murphy.}
{203}{}{是 啊再见，墨菲。}
### {204}{}{Mutually. You should wash up, slug.}
{204}{}{相互地你应该洗洗，鼻涕虫。}
### {205}{}{As long as Orris needs you. But just give me a chance and you'll be lying at my feet. Figure it out.}
{205}{}{只要欧里斯需要你。但只要给我一个机会，你就会躺在我的脚下。想清楚。}
### {206}{}{Yeah. Bye, Murphy.}
{206}{}{是 啊再见，墨菲。}
### {207}{}{You won't have to.}
{207}{}{你不必这么做。}
### {208}{}{Yes. Know your place.}
{208}{}{对了解自己的位置。}
### {209}{}{Bye, Murphy.}
{209}{}{再见，墨菲。}

### {210}{}{What do you need?}
{210}{}{你需要什么？}
### {1210}{}{What do you need, bitch?}
{1210}{}{你需要什么，婊子？}
### {211}{}{Whoa, take it easy, I'm already leaving.}
{211}{}{哇，别紧张，我已经走了。}
### {212}{}{What do I need?}
{212}{}{我需要什么？}
### {213}{}{Nothing. Bye.}
{213}{}{没有什么再见}
### {214}{}{Hi. What's up? Nobody bothers you from the locals?}
{214}{}{你好怎么了？当地人没有打扰你吗？}
### {215}{}{Everything is just fine. Bye.}
{215}{}{一切都很好。再见}
### {216}{}{Good to see you.}
{216}{}{很高兴见到你。}
### {217}{}{Bye.}
{217}{}{再见}

### {220}{}{They say you've been betrayed. Who do you think it could be?}
{220}{}{他们说你被背叛了。你认为可能是谁？}
### {221}{}{You're delusional. We can't stand the spirit of fire worshippers. None of us can even get close to the cathedral. They consider us criminals there.}
{221}{}{你有妄想症。我们无法忍受火崇拜者的精神。我们谁也不能靠近大教堂。他们认为我们是罪犯。}
### {222}{}{Sounds quite convincing.}
{222}{}{听起来很有说服力。}
### {223}{}{I will prove that there is a traitor among you.}
{223}{}{我要证明你们中间有叛徒。}
### {224}{}{I know who you are, Murphy. There's a file on you in the Cathedral. Do you want to discuss it?}
{224}{}{我知道你是谁，墨菲。大教堂里有一份关于你的档案。你想讨论一下吗？}
### {225}{}{Damn it, what are you talking about? What the hell kind of dossier? I have nothing to do with sectarians. Is it clear?}
{225}{}{该死，你在说什么？什么档案？我与宗派主义者无关。清楚了吗？}
### {226}{}{Of course, of course. But if you want to discuss it, come to the arena tonight. Let's talk quietly.}
{226}{}{当然，当然。但如果你想讨论的话，今晚就来竞技场吧。让我们安静地谈谈。}
### {227}{}{Well, if you think about it, not one Murphy in the whole city. Okay, forget it.}
{227}{}{好吧，如果你仔细想想，整个城市没有一个墨菲。好吧，算了。}

### {230}{}{I've told you everything. Think carefully about your decision.}
{230}{}{我已经告诉你一切了。仔细考虑你的决定。}
### {231}{}{OK.}
{231}{}{好啊}
### {232}{}{So what the hell does that mean? Were you sent from the Cathedral?}
{232}{}{那这到底是什么意思？你是从大教堂派来的吗？}
### {233}{}{I know you're a Follower agent. Must have been hard to ingratiate yourself with Orris?}
{233}{}{我知道你是追随者特工。肯定很难讨好奥？}
### {234}{}{Aaron needs agents all over the city. This is my mission. Do you think it was easy? I'm taking a big risk already dating you. By the way, who are you?}
{234}{}{亚伦需要全城的特工。这是我的使命。你认为这很容易吗？我已经在和你约会了，我冒着很大的风险。顺便问一下，你是谁？}
### {235}{}{You could say I'm playing my game.}
{235}{}{你可以说我在玩我的游戏。}
### {236}{}{The answer is not credible. At least it means we can come to an agreement. The thing is, I want to take Orris' place and reform the gang for the good of the church. If these guys only know how to beat their faces, then at least let them beat the right people.}
{236}{}{答案是不可信的。至少这意味着我们可以达成协议。问题是，为了教会的利益，我想取代奥利斯的位置，改造帮派。如果这些家伙只知道如何打脸，那么至少让他们打对人。}
### {237}{}{You have ambitious plans.}
{237}{}{你有雄心勃勃的计划。}
### {238}{}{So will you help me? The Church of Fire will remember your deeds. I can't depose Orris on my own without consequences.}
{238}{}{你能帮我吗？火之教会会记住你的事迹。我不能一个人废黜欧里斯而不承担任何后果。}
### {239}{}{You're a traitor. And I don't believe traitors.}
{239}{}{你是个叛徒。我不相信叛徒。}
### {240}{}{It's worse for you. Don't get in my way.}
{240}{}{这对你来说更糟。别挡我的路。}
### {241}{}{Well, well.}
{241}{}{嗯，嗯。}
### {242}{}{Orris and his gang must be stopped. But how to do it?}
{242}{}{必须制止欧里斯和他的团伙。但是怎么做呢？}
### {243}{}{I've been watching Orris for a long time. It will be difficult to shoot him unnoticed, because he is constantly in the spotlight. Think about how you can do it quietly, without making a fuss. Maybe a gunsmith or a pusher has something suitable?}
{243}{}{我已经看了很长时间了。很难在不被注意的情况下拍摄他，因为他一直处于聚光灯下。想一想你如何能安静地做这件事，而不必大惊小怪。也许枪械匠或推手有合适的东西？}
### {244}{}{I'll think about it.}
{244}{}{我会考虑的。}
### {245}{}{Orris is dead, I know. Thanks to you, the city will become calmer, and the cause of the Sacred Fire will shine again over the ruins.}
{245}{}{我知道欧里斯已经死了。感谢你，这座城市将变得平静，圣火的事业将再次照耀废墟。}
### {246}{}{It had to be done.}
{246}{}{必须这样做。}
### {247}{}{I will tell you about your feat in the Cathedral to avoid misunderstandings in the future. Goodbye, friend.}
{247}{}{我会告诉你你在大教堂的壮举，以避免将来的误解。再见，朋友。}
### {1247}{}{I will tell you about your feat in the Cathedral to avoid misunderstandings in the future. Goodbye, sister.}
{1247}{}{我会告诉你你在大教堂的壮举，以避免将来的误解。再见，姐姐。}
### {248}{}{Goodbye, Murphy.}
{248}{}{再见，墨菲。}
### {249}{}{And although the cathedral is destroyed, thanks to you there is hope. Perhaps all is not lost yet.}
{249}{}{尽管大教堂被毁了，但多亏了你，还是有希望的。也许一切还没有失去。}

### {250}{}{What are you doing, Murphy?}
{250}{}{你在干什么，墨菲？}
### {251}{}{Everything that Orris's right hand should be doing. He trusts me with the most difficult problems.}
{251}{}{奥的右手应该做的一切。他信任我解决最困难的问题。}
### {252}{}{So you're Orris' deputy? Well settled.}
{252}{}{你是奥的副手吗？安顿得很好。}
### {253}{}{How did you join the gang?}
{253}{}{你是怎么加入帮派的？}
### {254}{}{They don't keep Belarusians here. I was cleaning up extra people for Orris until he saw my real potential.}
{254}{}{他们不把白俄罗斯人留在这里。我一直在为奥利斯清理多余的人，直到他看到我真正的潜力。}
### {255}{}{You're a dangerous guy. I need to be careful with you.}
{255}{}{你是个危险的家伙。我需要小心你。}
### {256}{}{Why is your gang outlawed? They say the fire worshippers are pinching you.}
{256}{}{为什么你们的帮派是非法的？他们说拜火者在掐你。}
### {257}{}{Damn sectarians, I can't stand them. They tell us what is right and what is wrong. Why on earth? There is only one law on the streets - whoever is stronger is right. We proved it with our deeds. Only we have the right to manage this territory.}
{257}{}{该死的宗派主义者，我受不了他们。他们告诉我们什么是对的，什么是错的。为什么？街头只有一条法律――谁更强大，谁就是对的。我们用行动证明了这一点。只有我们有权管理这块领土。}
### {258}{}{Sounds reasonable.}
{258}{}{听起来很合理。}
### {259}{}{I'm on your side, Murphy. But how do I get to Orris?}
{259}{}{我支持你，墨菲。但是我怎样才能到达奥？}

### {260}{}{Listen, do you know who committed the sabotage at the power plant?}
{260}{}{听着，你知道是谁破坏了发电厂吗？}
### {261}{}{Perhaps. Why are you asking?}
{261}{}{可能你为什么要问？}
### {262}{}{I'm doing an investigation commissioned by Theodore.}
{262}{}{我正在接受西奥多的委托进行调查。}
### {263}{}{I don't like these ghouls. But I don't want to hand over their enemies either.}
{263}{}{我不喜欢这些食尸鬼。但我也不想交出他们的敌人。}
### {264}{}{Then forget it. I'll try to ask someone else.}
{264}{}{那就算了。我会试着问别人。}
### {265}{}{Come on, tell me. You can trust me.}
{265}{}{来吧，告诉我。你可以相信我。}
### {266}{}{Not you.}
{266}{}{不是你。}
### {267}{}{Sorry you don't trust me.}
{267}{}{对不起，你不信任我。}
### {268}{}{You have nothing to fear. Even if you're involved, I won't turn you in.}
{268}{}{你没有什么可害怕的。即使你参与其中，我也不会告发你。}
### {269}{}{Fear? For me? Ha! To be honest, I'm involved in this shit myself. Someone from the Cathedral asked for a diversion in order to persuade the ghouls to cooperate, because they themselves will not be able to fix anything. It turned out to be easy, because one of the undead himself was eager to get used to the fire worshippers.}
{269}{}{害怕为了我？哈老实说，我自己也卷入了这件事。大教堂里有人要求转移注意力，以说服食尸鬼合作，因为他们自己无法解决任何问题。事实证明，这很容易，因为其中一个不死生物自己也渴望适应火崇拜者。}
### {270}{}{Wow, that's a story! Now I'll know who's the main dude here. Bye, Murphy.}
{270}{}{哇，真是个故事！现在我知道谁是这里的主要人物了。再见，墨菲。}
### {271}{}{Why would you hide something? You're a cool dude, come on, tell me.}
{271}{}{你为什么要隐瞒什么？你是个很酷的家伙，来吧，告诉我。}
### {272}{}{Are you afraid of something? And I thought the Cardinals were cool guys...}
{272}{}{你害怕什么吗？我觉得红雀队很酷...}
