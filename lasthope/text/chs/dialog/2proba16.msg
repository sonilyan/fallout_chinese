{100}{}{Yeah, baby, I'm winning this one.}
{101}{}{My lucky roll.}
{102}{}{Oh, almost had it.}
{103}{}{Just a little more.}
{104}{}{This is not looking good.}
#
{105}{}{Hey man! Can't you see I'm on a lucky roll here? Piss off.}
#
{106}{}{Seriously, are you Jim?}
{107}{}{Sorry, my mistake.}
#
{108}{}{Maybe, who's asking?}
#
{110}{}{Mr. Basil wants his money back. Like, right now! Or you're gonna regret it.}
#money
{111}{}{What money, what are you talking about? And who the hell are you?}
#
{112}{}{The money you owe him. My name is not important.}
#
{113}{}{I paid my debts... at least, last time I had something to pay with. Not that I'm trying to fool around but I'm
 kinda broke here and thought I could win back some money... [sighs]. This sure isn't my lucky day...}
#
{114}{}{The way I see it... it could take a lot longer before you get a lucky roll, maybe we can do something about that debt...}
{115}{}{Well, it gets a whole lot better. Mr. Basil will sure have that money, one way or the other. Consider yourself
 lucky if I only break your legs.}
#
{116}{}{Be my guest. I can't make money grow on trees, you know, and $300 seems like a lot to grow...}
#
{117}{}{Very funny. Usually, I don't like comedians, but I'll help you anyway, makes me feel better.}
{118}{}{Speaking of money, my wallet, which I don't have, is empty, too. Like your trees! Hah, how about that.}
#dude has money
{119}{}{Oh, thank you so much! I thought I was a goner for sure. Even my hands are shaking... I'll just stay out of
 your way stranger.}
#
{120}{}{You do that. In the meantime, stay out of this place if you don't want your next visit to Mr. Basil to be your
 last.}
#
{121}{}{Thanks for that favor.}
{122}{}{I'm not spending any more money on gambling.}
{123}{}{Just leave me be. I'm fine.}
#
{124}{}{I'm already dead. Leave me alone now.}
{125}{}{Why did I ask that bastard for money?}
{126}{}{This is not happening.}
#107+
{127}{}{[Angrily, you take the dice from his hand.] Would you stop that, I'm talking to you...}
#
{128}{}{Hey, what the fuck! Give those back or you'll regret it!}
{129}{}{Shut up while I'm talking!}
{130}{}{[Show him the gun.] You want some of this, huh!? You better keep your voice down.}
#130
{131}{}{Uh, okay... Please, I have enough problems already. Can you pick on someone else, please, I'm in the middle
 of something here?}
{132}{}{[Laugh out loud.] You're in the middle of loosing all your money. By the way, your gambling skills suck.
 Now hand over Mr. Basil's money!}
{133}{}{I can hear you talking... Be quiet for a second, will you? Now, where's the money you took from Mr. Basil?}
