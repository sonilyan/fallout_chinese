### {101}{}{Here is a surviving scout of the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{101}{}{这是一位幸存的钢铁兄弟会侦察兵。}
### {102}{}{Someday the Brotherhood of Steel will return to Arizona. It's only a matter of time.}
{102}{}{总有一天，钢铁兄弟会将回到亚利桑那州。这只是时间问题。}

### {200}{}{(passing by, a stranger warily peers into your face) Hmm, I think I've seen you somewhere.}
{200}{}{（路过时，一个陌生人小心翼翼地看着你的脸）嗯，我想我在什么地方见过你。}
### {201}{}{Perhaps. You're not a local, are you?}
{201}{}{可能你不是本地人，是吗？}
### {202}{}{Yes. Just like you. Two strangers in an inhospitable town. It looks like a small world.}
{202}{}{对就像你一样。两个陌生人在一个荒凉的小镇上。它看起来像一个小世界。}
### {203}{}{That's right. But I have business here. Do you mind?}
{203}{}{没错。但我在这里有生意。你介意吗？}
### {204}{}{No. Go ahead.}
{204}{}{不，去吧。}
### {205}{}{For now.}
{205}{}{现在。}
### {206}{}{}
{206}{}{error : string is empty}
### {207}{}{}
{207}{}{error : string is empty}
### {208}{}{( nods in greeting)}
{208}{}{（点头致意）}
### {1208}{}{Only after you.}
{1208}{}{只有在你之后。}
### {209}{}{[Do the same]}
{209}{}{[做同样的事]}
### {1209}{}{You're so kind.}
{1209}{}{你真善良。}

### {210}{}{Ah, I remembered. It was you I saw shortly before the explosion at the Steel Port. A curious coincidence, isn't it?}
{210}{}{啊，我想起来了。我在钢铁港爆炸前不久看到的是你。这是一个奇怪的巧合，不是吗？}
### {211}{}{An explosion? Hey, it's nothing to do with me.}
{211}{}{爆炸？嘿，这与我无关。}
### {212}{}{Is someone accusing you?}
{212}{}{有人在指责你吗？}
### {213}{}{No, sir. Nobody.}
{213}{}{不，先生。没有人}
### {214}{}{Then why such nervousness? Don't worry, I still don't believe that a man like you could have gone through all the defenses on the ship and detonated the torpedoes. Not even all employees at the base had access there.}
{214}{}{那为什么这么紧张呢？别担心，我仍然不相信像你这样的人会突破船上的所有防御并引爆鱼雷。甚至基地的所有员工都无法进入那里。}
### {215}{}{Ugh, good. I already thought you suspected something. Uh, goodbye, sir. Have a good day.}
{215}{}{啊，很好。我已经以为你怀疑什么了。再见，先生。祝你今天过得愉快。}
### {216}{}{And if I say that the explosion is my handiwork?}
{216}{}{如果我说爆炸是我的杰作？}
### {217}{}{Now anyone can say that. I would never believe that some savage from the desert would have managed to get into a well-guarded hold and launch torpedoes. Where did you get such skills and knowledge, farmer?}
{217}{}{现在任何人都可以这么说。我永远不会相信，一些来自沙漠的野蛮人会设法进入一个戒备森严的船舱并发射鱼雷。农民，你是从哪里得到这样的技能和知识的？}
### {1217}{}{Now anyone can say that. I would never believe that some savage from the desert would have managed to get into a well-guarded hold and launch torpedoes. Where did you get such skills and knowledge, redneck?}
{1217}{}{现在任何人都可以这么说。我永远不会相信，一些来自沙漠的野蛮人会设法进入一个戒备森严的船舱并发射鱼雷。你从哪里得到这样的技能和知识，乡下人？}
### {218}{}{Indeed, it sounds fantastic. Like in the old comics. I hope your suspicions are settled?}
{218}{}{的确，这听起来很美妙。就像在旧漫画里一样。我希望你的怀疑得到解决？}
### {219}{}{Perhaps. But I'll be watching you out of the corner of my eye.}
{219}{}{可能但我会用眼角的余光看着你。}
### {220}{}{There's no need for that. Goodbye.}
{220}{}{没有必要这样。再见}
### {221}{}{You should keep quiet after all these events. Your Brotherhood is now part of history. Accept it.}
{221}{}{这些事情发生后你应该保持安静。你的兄弟会已经成为历史的一部分。接受它。}
### {222}{}{It's true. However, Puerto Penasco is just an outpost away from the main base. Perhaps we will come back here again.}
{222}{}{这是真的。然而，佩纳斯科港距离主基地只有一个前哨基地。也许我们会再次回到这里。}
### {223}{}{But it won't be soon. And by this point you will not be welcome here. Better think about your own fate, soldier.}
{223}{}{但不会很快。到目前为止，你在这里将不受欢迎。最好想想你自己的命运，士兵。}
### {224}{}{Coming here seemed like the smartest and safest idea. Okay, you won't hear from me again. Goodbye, stranger.}
{224}{}{来到这里似乎是最明智、最安全的想法。好吧，你不会再收到我的消息了。再见，陌生人。}
### {1224}{}{Coming here seemed like the smartest and safest idea. Okay, you won't hear from me again. Goodbye, stranger.}
{1224}{}{来到这里似乎是最明智、最安全的想法。好吧，你不会再收到我的消息了。再见，陌生人。}
### {225}{}{Goodbye, scout of the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{225}{}{再见，钢铁兄弟会的侦察员。}
### {226}{}{Come on, get out of here.}
{226}{}{来吧，离开这里。}
