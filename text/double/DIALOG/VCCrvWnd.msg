#{112}{}{[Waves his hand] Everything is fine! I won't set a foot in the Wind ever again. I will go with the caravans plying between Salt Lake and Vegas, as for the Wind - I won't make a single step in its direction! By the way, want to nibble a bit? [holds out a handful of little nuts]}
{112}{}{[挥挥手]一切都很好！我再也不会踏入风口浪尖了。我会和穿梭在盐湖城和维加斯之间的商队一起去，至于风，我不会朝着它的方向走一步！顺便问一下，想咬一口吗？[伸出一把小坚果] -- [Waves his hand] Everything is fine! I won't set a foot in the Wind ever again.

#{113}{}{What is this?}
{113}{}{这是什么？ -- What is this?}
#{114}{}{Vocas. The guys just returned from Salt Lake. You know they've got the great salt lake out there, where mutated water lily grows. It won't grow anywhere else. Two times a year it blooms and gives the nuts. Nibble on it, you won't regret. The taste is bitter, but they help to excrete all sorts of crap out of your body. Useful stuff, in short.}
{114}{}{人声。他们刚从盐湖城回来。你知道那里有大盐湖，变异的睡莲生长在那里。它不会在其他地方生长。它一年开花两次，结果开花了。咬一口，你就不会后悔了。味道是苦的，但是它们有助于排出你身体里的各种垃圾。总之，有用的东西。 -- Vocas. The guys just returned from Salt Lake.
