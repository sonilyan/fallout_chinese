#{100}{}{You see mister Farber.}
{100}{}{你看法伯先生。}
#{101}{}{You see the administrator of the slave ring.}
{101}{}{你看到了奴隶环的管理员。}
#{102}{}{Sorry. Everyone has their golden age. But it always ends.}
{102}{}{对不起的。每个人都有自己的黄金时代。但它总是结束。}
#{110}{}{[Appraises you with a glance] Betting... Or fighting?}
{110}{}{[看你一眼]打赌...还是打架？}
#{111}{}{What, I can fight?}
{111}{}{什么，我能战斗？}
#{112}{}{Neither. Just watching.}
{112}{}{都不是。只是看着而已。}
#{113}{}{Yeah, there's an opportunity. Would you like to know more?}
{113}{}{是的，有个机会。你想知道更多吗？}
#{114}{}{Yeah, tell me about the ring fights.}
{114}{}{是的，跟我说说拳击比赛。}
#{115}{}{Understood.}
{115}{}{理解。}
#{116}{}{Where did you get the fighters on the ring right now?}
{116}{}{你从哪儿弄来的拳击手？}
#{117}{}{I'm going now.}
{117}{}{我要走了。}
#{118}{}{So, do you ready to fight?}
{118}{}{你准备好战斗了吗？}
#{119}{}{From Slavertown, of course. The slavers guild is upstairs, and the courtyard is always full of livestock. They own the whole ring.}
{119}{}{当然是从斯莱弗敦来的。奴隶公会在楼上，院子里总是满是牲畜。他们拥有整个戒指。}
#{120}{}{Hmh. [Studies you closer] You know, we have a very *hardcore* ring. Real bloodsport! But you have potential. I suggest you to train a little.}
{120}{}{嗯。[仔细研究你]你知道，我们有一个非常“铁杆”的戒指。真正的血腥运动！但你有潜力。我建议你训练一下。}
#{121}{}{So, I don't fit? What a shame.}
{121}{}{所以，我不适合？真可惜。}
#{122}{}{[Studies you closer] What determination! But I'm warning you - we have fights *without limits*. Bloodsport! The only rule is no weapons. I suggest warming up first. We even have a coach.}
{122}{}{[仔细研究你]什么决心！但我要警告你-我们有无限的战斗。血泊！唯一的规则是没有武器。我建议先热身。我们甚至有教练。}
#{123}{}{How much will I earn for a victory?}
{123}{}{一场胜利我能挣多少钱？}
#{124}{}{That depends on how much everyone will lose on the bets. Betting happens during the fight and then the winnings are handed out. What is left is divided among those involved in the fight.}
{124}{}{这取决于每个人在赌注中会输多少钱。在比赛中下注，然后分发奖金。剩下的在那些参与战斗的人中间分成两半。}
#{125}{}{My opponents will be slaves?}
{125}{}{我的对手将成为奴隶？}
#{126}{}{At first - yes. Sometimes champions from New Reno come by. Sometimes ours come to them. It'll be one hell of a show either way.}
{126}{}{一开始-是的。有时新雷诺的冠军会来。有时我们的会来找他们。不管怎样，这都会是一场精彩的演出。}
#{127}{}{Hell? Exactly what I'm looking for!}
{127}{}{地狱？正是我要找的！}
#{128}{}{I suggest getting ready first. We usually begin the real fights in the evening, at 21:00.}
{128}{}{我建议你先准备好。我们通常在晚上21点开始真正的战斗。}
#{129}{}{Alright.}
{129}{}{好吧。}
#{130}{}{Can you tell me what I'm missing?}
{130}{}{你能告诉我我错过了什么吗？}
#{132}{}{Hey, ready to fight?!}
{132}{}{嘿，准备好战斗了吗？！}
#{133}{}{Hell YEAH!!!}
{133}{}{是啊！！！}
#{134}{}{Not yet.}
{134}{}{还没有。}
#{135}{}{Great! You still have some time. The coach will warm you up a bit and then... THERE WILL BE BLOOD!!!}
{135}{}{太好了！你还有时间。教练会让你热身然后...会有血的！！！}
#{136}{}{[Wait until 21:00 and go into the ring]}
{136}{}{[等到21:00进入拳击场]}
#{137}{}{Here you are! Your prize... [hands over the winnings] Once you're ready for the next fight, just talk to me.}
{137}{}{给你！你的奖品...一旦你准备好下一场比赛，就跟我说。}
#{138}{}{Fine.}
{138}{}{好的。}
#{139}{}{Who do we have here! Thirsty for more bloodshed?}
{139}{}{我们这里有谁！渴望更多的流血？}
#{140}{}{Yes, I'm ready to fight.}
{140}{}{是的，我准备好战斗了。}
#{141}{}{No, just looking at those slaves.}
{141}{}{不，只是看看那些奴隶。}
#{142}{}{Err, no, we're not ready. Come back tomorrow, ok?}
{142}{}{呃，不，我们还没准备好。明天再来，好吗？}
#{143}{}{What determination! Let's go!}
{143}{}{多么坚定的决心！走吧！}
#{144}{}{What determination! You may have noticed we're increasing the pressure, raising the stakes slowly. But *something* just came up and this something threw you a challenge. I'm sure you'll enjoy this. Onwards!}
{144}{}{多么坚定的决心！你可能已经注意到我们在增加压力，慢慢提高赌注。但是，突然出现了什么，这件事给你带来了挑战。我相信你会喜欢的。向前！}
#{145}{}{You'll get an extra reward for this fight. This time we've got a special visitor from New Reno. He himself asked for a fight with you. My warning - this will be serious, even for our ring. I'd suggest remembering all your weaknesses. They'll be your biggest problems.}
{145}{}{你会得到额外的奖励。这次我们有一位来自新里诺的特别客人。他自己要求和你打架。我的警告-这将是严重的，甚至对我们的戒指。我建议记住你所有的弱点。它们将是你最大的问题。}
#{146}{}{Bloody amazing! How didn't you tear his hand out with that hold? We get a pretty payout for fights like these, the audience is just ecstatic! Anyway, here's your reward [hands over the cash]}
{146}{}{太神奇了！你怎么没把他的手扯出来？像这样的打斗我们得到了可观的回报，观众简直欣喜若狂！不管怎样，这是你的报酬[把钱交出来]}
#{147}{}{The crowd was just crazy about that fight! That's what I call determination! Here's the coin, champion! [hands over the cash] But... Now for the bad news.}
{147}{}{观众都为那场战斗而疯狂！这就是我所说的决心！这是硬币，冠军！[交出现金]但是...现在是坏消息。}
#{148}{}{What do you mean!?}
{148}{}{你什么意思？}
#{149}{}{We have a bit of a problem. The crowd believes in you. They put big money on you and... Win! Do you get where I'm going with this?}
{149}{}{我们有点问题。群众信任你。他们给了你一大笔钱...赢了！你知道我要说什么吗？}
#{150}{}{Of course! The fans love me.}
{150}{}{当然！球迷们爱我。}
#{151}{}{That's why, my friend, we can't keep making money on your victories. The crowd isn't losing their bets, which is how we're meant to make a profit. So, this was your last fight here. You have leave the ring... Keep in mind, Reno has a huge ring as well, maybe you should try your luck there.}
{151}{}{这就是为什么，我的朋友，我们不能一直靠你的胜利赚钱。观众们并没有输掉他们的赌注，这就是我们赚钱的本意。所以，这是你最后一次打架。你把戒指留下...记住，雷诺也有一个巨大的戒指，也许你应该试试你的运气。}
#{152}{}{And it was going so well...}
{152}{}{一切都很顺利...}
#{159}{}{[Sighs, as if he hears this question every day] Well, you don't look strong enough. Lift some weights. The crowd needs something to look at. And your skills seem to be lacking - you don't look like you've been in a fight or even in a bar brawl.}
{159}{}{[叹息，好像他每天都听到这个问题]嗯，你看起来不够强壮。举起一些重物。人群需要看些东西。而且你的技能似乎很欠缺――你看起来不像是在打架，甚至不是在酒吧斗殴。}
#{160}{}{Well, you seem to have the skill if a skilled fighter. But you are lacking the musculature. Our fighters will knock you down in the first round, which means the viewers won't get a kick.}
{160}{}{好吧，你似乎有一种技巧，如果一个熟练的战士。但是你缺少肌肉组织。我们的拳手会在第一轮把你击倒，这意味着观众不会被踢到。}
#{161}{}{You might look ripped, that isn't a problem. But you don't look like a very skilled fighter. I suggest getting some tips for hand-to-hand. We've got a coach for that.}
{161}{}{你看起来像被撕破了一样，这不是问题。但你看起来不像一个技术高超的战士。我建议你给我一些手到擒来的建议。我们已经有教练了。}
#{162}{}{Alright, got it. Thank you.}
{162}{}{好的，明白了。非常感谢。}
#{170}{}{[His face immediately changes as he sees the pizza in your hands] Gecko bite me! Where the fuck were you, courier!? Get this shit outta here. I'll be talking to your boss personally to make sure they throw you right the fuck out! Phillips Cafe has *never* let me down like this before. EVER!}
{170}{}{[当他看到你手里的比萨饼时，他的脸立刻变了]壁虎咬我！你他妈的在哪，信使！？把这该死的东西弄出去。我会亲自和你老板谈谈，确保他们把你赶出去！菲利普斯咖啡馆从来没有像这样让我失望过。永远！}
#{171}{}{[Leave]}
{171}{}{[离开]}
#{172}{}{[His face immediately changes as he sees the pizza in your hands] Gecko bite me! How did you get to this, fighter!? I won't even talk about why did you managed to join a pizza delivery service after all your glory on the ring, but to be late for such a simple delivery? Philips Cafe has *never* let me down before. You can return the pizza, I'll talk to your boss personally. Get out of my sight!}
{172}{}{[当他看到你手里的比萨饼时，他的脸立刻变了]壁虎咬我！你是怎么做到的，斗士！？我甚至不想说为什么你在拳击场上赢得了这么多荣誉之后还参加了一个披萨送货服务，但却因为这么简单的送货而迟到了？飞利浦咖啡馆从来没有让我失望过。你可以把比萨饼还给我，我会亲自和你老板谈的。快离开我的视线！}
#{173}{}{[Seeing the pizza in your hands, he makes a short wave with his hand, indicating for you to wait] Hold on, courier.}
{173}{}{[看到你手里的比萨饼，他用手向你挥手示意让你等]等等，信使。}
#{174}{}{[Wait]}
{174}{}{[等等]}
#{175}{}{[You're waiting as the administrator goes through his ledgers]}
{175}{}{[你在等管理员检查他的账本]}
#{176}{}{Ahem...}
{176}{}{啊哼...}
#{177}{}{[Wait a little longer]}
{177}{}{[再等一会儿]}
#{178}{}{[You wait longer as the administrator talks to someone about the weather and the latest bets]}
{178}{}{[当管理员与某人谈论天气和最新赌注时，您等待的时间更长]}
#{179}{}{[Ignores your attempt to get his attention]}
{179}{}{[无视你试图引起他的注意]}
#{180}{}{Excuse me, sir, your pizza...}
{180}{}{对不起，先生，你的披萨...}
#{181}{}{[Keep waiting]}
{181}{}{[继续等待]}
#{182}{}{Wait, courier! I said wait!}
{182}{}{等等，信使！我说等等！}
#{183}{}{Here's what, how about you pay, or you'll be left without your pizza?}
{183}{}{这样吧，要不你付钱，要不你就没比萨饼了？}
#{184}{}{No problem, sir. I'll wait.}
{184}{}{没问题，先生。我会等的。}
#{185}{}{[After a few more minutes, when you've been pushed into a corner by a crowd of onlookers, the administrator waves you over] How much?}
{185}{}{[再过几分钟，当你被一群围观者推到角落时，管理员向你挥手]多少钱？}
#{186}{}{What are you mumbling there? Wait! I said wait!}
{186}{}{你在咕哝什么？等待！我说等等！}
#{187}{}{Either you pay for the pizza or I leave.}
{187}{}{要么你付披萨的钱，要么我走。}
#{188}{}{$, sir.}
{188}{}{$，先生。}
#{189}{}{[Widens his eyes] Where did Phillips began hiring such rude assholes!? Just remember, this isn't the last you heard from me! Now give me that pizza, here's your pathetic pay. Take it and get the hell out of here.}
{189}{}{[睁大眼睛]菲利普斯从哪里开始雇佣这样粗鲁的混蛋！？记住，这不是你最后一次听到我的消息！把披萨给我，这是你可怜的薪水。拿着它滚出去。}
#{190}{}{There isn't enough here.}
{190}{}{这里不够。}
#{191}{}{Thank you, sir, but I need another 10$ for the delivery.}
{191}{}{谢谢，先生，但我还需要10美元来送货。}
#{192}{}{You didn't earn it! Your delivery is shit! Now get the hell out!}
{192}{}{不是你赚的！你送的东西糟透了！现在滚出去！}
#{193}{}{But I thought you were a man of honor. After all, I did my part - brought the pizza on time and waited for you in this crowd. Maybe you should rethink this.}
{193}{}{但我以为你是个正直的人。毕竟，我尽了自己的一份力――按时送来披萨，在人群中等你。也许你应该重新考虑一下。}
#{194}{}{[Leave]}
{194}{}{[离开]}
#{195}{}{Hmm... Perhaps I was mistaken about you and Phillips hired you for a reason. Alright, here's your tip. Now get out of here.}
{195}{}{Hmm...也许我看错你了，菲利普斯雇你是有原因的。好吧，给你小费。现在离开这里。}
#{196}{}{Thank you, sir.}
{196}{}{谢谢，先生。}
#{197}{}{[Critically looks the pizza over before counting out the money]}
{197}{}{[数钱前仔细看了看比萨饼]}
#{198}{}{You didn't ear it! Your delivery is shit. While you were standing around, you managed to ruin it's look. Look: the box is crumpled, the topping is a jumble. You need to be more careful next time. Now get outta here!}
{198}{}{你没听见！你的送货真是糟透了。当你站在那里的时候，你破坏了它的外观。看：盒子被弄皱了，上面的东西乱七八糟的。下次你要小心点。快离开这里！}
#{199}{}{Don't waste my time with any of that crap! Get out.}
{199}{}{别把我的时间浪费在那些废话上！走出。}
