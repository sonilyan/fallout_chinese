### {220}{}{It's all because of that damn tower in the Sea of Cortez. It has been there since time immemorial. She didn't have any problems before. The Pescadores even used it for recreation until some flying monsters got there. And recently, some kind of poisonous filth began to drain from this platform. Half the sea is probably already dead because of her.}
{220}{}{这都是因为科尔特斯海那座该死的塔。它自古以来就在那里。她以前没有遇到任何问题。佩斯卡多雷斯人甚至用它来娱乐，直到一些会飞的怪物到达那里。最近，一些有毒的污物开始从这个平台上排出。因为她，半个大海可能已经死了。}

{224}{}{我只是通过双筒望远镜看到他们是怎么进去的。从那以后就再也没有听说过他们。很明显，他们都死了。（直接从瓶子里深深地吸了一口）}
### {225}{}{Sorry. You must have loved your uncle?}
{225}{}{很抱歉你一定爱你的叔叔吧？}
