### {50}{}{[The woman squints] I see. Livos dwellers have completely lost their self-respect and allow anyone in. Young man, it's a great honor for you to become one of the dwellers. And you need to learn to behave with dignity, as befits the ancient and respected family name of Schweins. Anyway, you're one of us now, so - welcome. I am Veronica Schwein.}
{50}{}{[那个女人斜视]我明白了。利沃斯的居民已经完全失去了自尊，允许任何人进入。年轻人，你能成为居民之一是一种莫大的荣誉。你需要学会有尊严地行事，这符合古老而受人尊敬的施魏因家族的姓氏。不管怎样，你现在是我们的一员了，所以――欢迎。我是维罗妮卡・施温。}

{52}{999}{维罗妮卡，我刚刚想起一件我需要做的事，待会儿再谈。}


### {60}{}{[The woman indifferently turns away] I have no time nor intention to do a small talk. If you have no business with me, let's not waste each other's time. I am Veronica Schwein, the most well-known political figure in Livos. I don't chat.}
{60}{}{[女人冷漠地转过身去]我既没有时间也无意闲聊。如果你和我没有关系，我们就不要浪费彼此的时间。我是维罗妮卡・施维因，利沃斯最知名的政治人物。我不聊天。}
### {61}{010}{Glad to meet you. Can I ask some questions?}
{61}{010}{很高兴见到你。我可以问一些问题吗？}

{62}{999}{维罗妮卡，我刚刚想起一件我需要做的事，待会儿再谈。}


### {70}{}{[The woman opens her mouth amazed, but quickly returns to her indifferent and arrogant look] You, young man, are ill-mannered and rude. I am Veronica Schwein, and I ask you to show me some respect because I represent the ancient and great family of Schweins. You'll have to learn to be discreet and polite to fit in Livos.}
{70}{}{[女人惊讶地张开嘴，但很快又恢复了她冷漠傲慢的表情]你，年轻人，举止粗鲁。我是维罗妮卡・施维因，我请你对我表示尊重，因为我代表着古老而伟大的施维因家族。你必须学会谨慎和礼貌，才能适应利沃斯。}
### {71}{010}{Understood. Can I ask some questions?}

{1001}{}{你好，指挥官。你是来谈生意的吗？}
### {1002}{}{I'm listening.}
{1002}{}{我在听。}
### {1003}{}{Hello. Did you come to talk business?}
{1003}{}{你好你是来谈生意的吗？}
### {101}{011}{Veronica, what is it you do here, in Livos?}
{101}{011}{维罗妮卡，你在利沃什干什么？}
### {102}{014}{Tell me about other families.}
{102}{014}{告诉我其他家庭的情况。}
### {103}{012}{How can I be useful around here?}
{103}{012}{我在这里怎么能有用？}
### {104}{013}{I'd like to know more about the Schwein family.}
{104}{013}{我想了解更多关于施温家族的情况。}
### {105}{999}{Okay, Veronica, I need to go. Bye.}
{105}{999}{好的，维罗妮卡，我得走了。再见}


### {110}{}{[Veronica proudly raises her head] I am the most influential politician in Livos. No meeting is concluded without my speech in it. I have the biggest amount of given speeches and suggestions. And many of my ideas were accepted and became a reality.}
{110}{}{[维罗妮卡骄傲地抬起头]我是利沃斯最有影响力的政治家。没有我的发言，任何会议都不会结束。我的发言和建议最多。我的许多想法被接受并成为现实。}
### {111}{013}{What are the other members of the Schwein family doing?}
{111}{013}{施温家族的其他成员在做什么？}
### {112}{014}{What can you tell me about other families?}
{112}{014}{你能告诉我其他家庭的情况吗？}


### {120}{}{Everyone does their part in Livos... But I think that except for one-time jobs of repairing the equipment, it would be difficult for you to find something to do. All profitable areas are divided and occupied, and you can't compete with me in politics. I suppose you could be valuable as a scout, provider of some rare tech, and also in creating diplomatic connections with other Radius settlements.}
{120}{}{每个人都在利沃斯尽自己的一份力量。。。但我认为，除了修理设备的一次性工作，你很难找到工作。所有有利可图的领域都被分割和占领了，你在政治上无法与我竞争。我想，作为一名侦察兵，提供一些稀有技术，以及与其他Radius定居点建立外交关系，你可能会很有价值。}
### {121}{010}{I see. Another question.}
{121}{010}{我明白了。另一个问题。}


### {130}{}{[She bursts with pride] The Schwein family is the greatest and the most powerful in Livos! We control the most important aspects of the vault's life. My son, Christopher, is busy with external trade. Ludwig, my husband, is an outstanding scientist and inventor, one of a kind, I must say. His brother Edward is in charge of the vault's protection. And I, modestly speaking, am the most experienced and perceptive politician and spokesman in Livos.}
{130}{}{[她自豪地爆发]施温家族是利沃斯最伟大、最强大的家族！我们控制着金库生活中最重要的方面。我的儿子克里斯托弗正忙于对外贸易。路德维希，我的丈夫，是一位杰出的科学家和发明家，我必须说，他是独一无二的。他的弟弟爱德华负责保护金库。谦虚地说，我是利沃什最有经验、最有洞察力的政治家和发言人。}
### {131}{015}{How did you become Ludwig's wife?}
{131}{015}{你是怎么成为路德维希的妻子的？}
### {132}{010}{Great. I have another question.}
{132}{010}{太棒了我还有一个问题。}


### {140}{}{[Veronica chuckles] The other families are a pale imitation of the Schweins. They are nothing. They do the easiest and unnecessary jobs, which could be handled by anyone. McKinseys are putting water into barrels, Hortons are busy with petty fixings, and Duntons are trying to give me a challenge in politics. In short, they all are a bunch of losers, playing the game that's too big for them.}
{140}{}{[维罗妮卡笑了笑]其他的家庭都是对施温家的苍白模仿。他们什么都不是。他们做的是最简单和不必要的工作，任何人都可以处理。麦金西夫妇正在把水放进桶里，霍顿夫妇正忙于琐碎的事情，而邓顿夫妇正试图在政治上给我一个挑战。简而言之，他们都是一群失败者，玩着对他们来说太大的游戏。}
### {141}{010}{I see. Another question.}
{141}{010}{我明白了。另一个问题。}


### {150}{}{[She gives out a smile of a winner] Oh, that was such a story. Ludwig kept himself locked in his working quarters for ages. So Edward spread a rumor that Ludwig will come out to choose the best woman of all who attends. Notice that I said not the most beautiful, not the most smart, but "the best". That's why I became his wife. I was the best - best prepared, best planned everything, best dealt with competitors. So, I achieved my dream and became a member of a great family of Schweins!}
{150}{}{[她露出胜利者的微笑]哦，真是个故事。路德维希把自己锁在工作区很长时间了。因此，爱德华散布谣言说，路德维希将出来挑选所有出席者中最好的女人。注意，我说的不是最漂亮的，不是最聪明的，而是“最好的”。这就是我成为他的妻子的原因。我是最好的――准备得最好，计划得最好，与竞争对手打得最好。于是，我实现了我的梦想，成为了一个伟大的施魏因家族的成员！}
### {151}{016}{Dealt with the competitors?}
{151}{016}{与竞争对手打交道？}


### {160}{}{Yes! Someone had a bit of a stomach ache on that exact day, others had their carriage broken on the way to Livos, some run into the pack of wild jackals. So, the ones who made it to the vault were in pretty bad shape. And by the entrance, they were met by a couple of tough guys who can do anything for a handful of batteries. My competitors were very lucky to stay alive - but not so lucky to be of actual competition to me anymore.}
{160}{}{对就在那一天，有人有点胃痛，还有人在去利沃斯的路上马车坏了，还有人撞上了一群野豺。所以，那些进入跳马的人的状态非常糟糕。在入口处，他们遇到了几个硬汉，他们只需几块电池就可以做任何事情。我的竞争对手很幸运能活着，但对我来说不再是真正的竞争对手了。}
### {161}{010}{Good plan, I give you that. I want to ask something else.}
{161}{010}{好计划，我给你。我想问别的问题。}
