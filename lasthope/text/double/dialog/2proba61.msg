#
{107}{}{Howdy, stranger! Got any junk you could sell to me?}
{108}{}{What kind of junk?}
{109}{}{Who the hell would want to buy junk?}
{110}{}{Nope, no junk.}
#What kind of junk...
{111}{}{You know... whatever junk you can find, I don't care. I buy metal scraps, old metal tools, mostly things made
 of metal. So if you find anything and you don't see how it can be used again, [smiles] like junk, stop by so we can
 do some business.}
{112}{}{What do you need all that junk for?}
{113}{}{Sure thing. Let me ask you something else.}
#what, use junk...
{114}{}{Usually I find lots of metal pieces in it, so I melt them. Later, when I have enough material, I can use it to
 make tools, such as crowbars, pipes, some melee weapons too... [He smiles.] Can I offer you something from my
 inventory?}
{115}{}{Got something interesting for me? Let me see.}
{116}{}{Thanks, but I'll pass.}
#buy junk...
{117}{}{Everybody needs junk... you can't get enough of it.}
{118}{}{Yeah, right.}
{119}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
#after buy...
{120}{}{At my place... always the best junk! See you around, pal.}
{121}{}{Sure.}
#again...
{122}{}{Hello there, what can I offer you this time, some junk maybe?}
{123}{}{I was thinking about... hm, junk?}
