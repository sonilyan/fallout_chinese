### {202}{}{The jackals are pretty weak, so we won't need any serious weapons. But they are pressed by numbers and huddle in packs in cramped corridors. It would be nice to throw a grenade there or charge them with a shot.}
{202}{}{豺狼很弱，所以我们不需要任何严重的武器。但他们被人数所迫，成群结队地挤在狭窄的走廊里。如果能在那里扔一枚手榴弹或向他们开枪，那就太好了。}

### {210}{}{It looks like it. These burrows are cleared of parasites. It remains to feel the corpses for valuables and get home.}
