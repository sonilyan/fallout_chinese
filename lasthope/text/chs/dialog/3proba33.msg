{110}{}{这里的每个人都为布莱恩工作。问题。。。什么问题？我就不能平静一下吗。哦，好吧。。。问问你想要什么。}

{111}{}{你在这里做什么？}

{112}{}{事实上，我现在什么都不需要问你。}

{115}{}{谢谢让我再问你一件事。}
### {116}{}{New guy, nice to have you here. People call me Chris. I'm the only one who can get anything you need. So, if you want some stuff, talk to me. Right?}
{116}{}{新人，很高兴有你在这里。人们叫我克里斯。我是唯一一个能得到你需要的任何东西的人。所以，如果你想要一些东西，和我谈谈。对吧？}

### {118}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{118}{}{让我再问你一件事。}
### {119}{}{Like I said, anything you need. Most of that stuff is legal everywhere else but that bastard Brian completely cut off the supplies, even if half of the population is addicted to it. There will be trouble if these people don't get what they paid for, sooner than he thinks.}
{119}{}{就像我说的，任何你需要的。大多数东西在其他地方都是合法的，但那个混蛋布莱恩完全切断了供应，即使一半的人对此上瘾。如果这些人不能比他想象的更快地得到他们所支付的，就会有麻烦。}

{121}{}{我认为他是对的。但首先，他应该阻止人们出售这些垃圾。}

{122}{}{太可怕了！布赖恩下令进行更多的检查，这影响了我的业务。。。而且情况越来越糟。在我们用完之前，我必须找到另一种方法把一些东西带到这里，否则我们就完蛋了！}
### {123}{}{What are you going to do?}
{123}{}{你打算怎么办？}
### {124}{}{Why do you suddenly care? You have been in this town for, what, five minutes and you already feel sad. I don't buy that crap! You are no better than these addicts that buy drugs from me. Look how desperate they are. Jet became their whole life...}
{124}{}{你为什么突然在意？你已经在这个小镇上呆了五分钟了，你已经感到难过了。我不买账！你并不比那些从我这里买毒品的瘾君子好。看看他们有多绝望。喷气式飞机成了他们的全部生活。。。}
### {125}{}{And I'm here to change that, you monster!}
{125}{}{我是来改变这一点的，你这个怪物！}
### {126}{}{You... to change!? Just being here makes you a loser. I remember a man who wanted to change things, Charles. Yep... but he choose the wrong way to do it. He thought that stealing money from Brian was going to pass unnoticed. He was too clumsy for his own good so I had to take over his work, and his money of course. It would be such a shame to spent it like he did, giving it to the poor...}
{126}{}{你改变！？只是在这里会让你成为失败者。我记得有个人想改变现状，查尔斯。是的。。。但他选择了错误的方式。他认为从布赖恩那里偷钱会被忽视。为了他自己的利益，他太笨拙了，所以我不得不接管他的工作，当然还有他的钱。如果像他那样把钱花掉，给穷人，那将是一种耻辱。。。}
### {127}{}{You took his money, and what about his life?}

{130}{}{停在那里！别再靠近了！}
### {131}{}{I killed Charles and I'm not going to give up. This is going to end now!}
{131}{}{我杀了查尔斯，我不会放弃。这就要结束了！}
### {132}{}{I'm coming, oh mighty one!}
{132}{}{我来了，哦，强大的一个！}
### {133}{}{You again, can I get you something?}
{133}{}{你再说一遍，我能给你拿点什么吗？}
### {134}{}{Sure thing, what do you need?}
{134}{}{当然，你需要什么？}
### {135}{}{Can you get me something strong, to keep me in a good mood?}
{135}{}{你能给我弄点烈性酒，让我保持好心情吗？}
