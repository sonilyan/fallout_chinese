#Questions
### {220}{}{I met a prisoner on the way.}
{220}{}{我在路上遇到一个囚犯。}
### {221}{}{Yes, we use the prisoners' labor to rebuild the ship. Don't talk to them.}
{221}{}{是的，我们用囚犯的劳动来重建这艘船。不要和他们说话。}
### {222}{}{A very rational decision.}
{222}{}{一个非常合理的决定。}
### {223}{}{A person has committed a crime and is serving a sentence. He was given a second chance. Let him be grateful for our mercy.}
{223}{}{一个人犯了罪正在服刑。他得到了第二次机会。让他感激我们的仁慈。}
### {224}{}{However, he says that he took only a few cobs on a huge plantation.}
{224}{}{然而，他说他在一个巨大的种植园里只采了几根玉米棒。}
### {225}{}{First of all, this is not an excuse. And secondly, criminals are always trying to belittle their guilt. Of course, he does not admit that there were more cobs or that the robbery also took place in city houses. The usual thing.}
{225}{}{首先，这不是借口。其次，罪犯总是试图贬低他们的罪行。当然，他不承认有更多的玉米芯，也不承认抢劫也发生在城市的房子里。通常的事情。}
### {226}{}{I understand now. May I ask another question?}
{226}{}{我现在明白了。我可以再问一个问题吗？}
### {227}{}{Either that, or you yourself are covering up your slaveholding ambitions.}
{227}{}{要么是这样，要么你自己在掩盖你的蓄奴野心。}
### {228}{}{Nonsense! History shows well that forced labor is effective only in the short term. Besides, there is no need to resort to such measures when there are so many real criminals around. Grab any of them and make them benefit society. Here's a reasonable approach.}
{228}{}{胡说历史充分表明，强迫劳动只在短期内有效。此外，当周围有这么多真正的罪犯时，没有必要采取这种措施。抓住他们中的任何一个，让他们造福社会。这是一个合理的方法。}
### {229}{}{Perhaps you are right.}
{229}{}{也许你是对的。}
### {230}{}{Well, well, tell me more.}
{230}{}{好吧，好吧，告诉我更多。}
### {231}{}{Is it humane to put a collar on him and make him work?}
{231}{}{给他戴上项圈让他工作是否人道？}
### {232}{}{Humane? A person has committed a crime, let him be grateful for the preservation of his worthless life.}
{232}{}{善良的一个人犯了罪，让他心存感激，因为他保全了自己毫无价值的生命。}
### {233}{}{He says that he took only a few cobs on a huge plantation in order to survive.}
{233}{}{他说，为了生存，他在一个巨大的种植园里只采了几根玉米芯。}
### {234}{}{Can you tell me who is who on the ship?}
{234}{}{你能告诉我船上的人是谁吗？}
### {235}{}{So you're not the one behind slavery in Arizona?}
{235}{}{那么你不是亚利桑那州奴隶制的幕后黑手？}
### {236}{}{No, of course not. However, I know that some of our allies sometimes abuse their position. It's just a cost.}
{236}{}{不，当然不是。然而，我知道我们的一些盟友有时会滥用他们的立场。这只是一个成本。}

### {240}{}{Tell me about this ship.}
{240}{}{告诉我这艘船的情况。}
### {241}{}{This vessel is the destroyer Vokelgazing DD-1862. Length 130 yards, width 13.6, draft 4.77 ... Ah, if this car was on the move, it would develop a speed of up to 35 nautical knots.}
{241}{}{这艘船是Vokelgaeting DD-1862号驱逐舰。长130码，宽13.6，吃水4.77……啊，如果这辆车在行驶，它的速度将达到35海里/小时。}
### {242}{}{Sounds cool. What else can you tell me?}
{242}{}{听起来很酷。你还能告诉我什么？}
### {243}{}{Destroyer - what does it mean?}
{243}{}{毁灭者-这是什么意思？}
### {244}{}{That there are several damn nuclear torpedoes on board the ship, each of which is capable of destroying a small city. Any soldier on a ship dreams of seeing such an explosion. But, fortunately, there was no reason for this yet.}
{244}{}{船上有几枚该死的核鱼雷，每枚都能摧毁一座小城市。船上的任何士兵都梦想看到这样的爆炸。但是，幸运的是，目前还没有这样的理由。}
### {245}{}{This ship can't go to sea?}
{245}{}{这艘船不能出海？}
### {246}{}{Just not now. The ship will not have enough nuclear fuel for a long voyage. In addition, repair of old equipment and housing is required. We knew it was a one-way voyage until we set up a base in this port.}
{246}{}{只是现在不行。这艘船将没有足够的核燃料进行长途航行。此外，还需要修理旧设备和住房。在我们在这个港口建立基地之前，我们就知道这是一次单程航行。}
### {247}{}{Why are some doors blocked?}
{247}{}{为什么有些门被堵住了？}
### {248}{}{There are reasons. Some things on the ship require particularly careful care. But even among their own mistakes happen. Therefore, there are places where only the Supreme Paladin Dixon has access.}
{248}{}{这是有原因的。船上有些东西需要特别小心。但即使在他们自己的错误中也会发生。因此，有些地方只有最高圣骑士迪克森才能进入。}
### {249}{}{I see. Thanks for the answers.}
{249}{}{我明白了。谢谢你的回答。}

### {250}{}{Tell me about the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{250}{}{告诉我钢铁兄弟会。}
### {251}{}{What exactly do you want to know about our order?}

### {252}{}{Enough talk about the Brotherhood. Now I know enough.}
{252}{}{谈够兄弟会了。现在我知道的够多了。}
### {253}{}{Where did you all come from?}
{253}{}{你们都是从哪里来的？}
### {254}{}{We came from California. Previously, they sat quietly in their bunker and did not meddle in worldly affairs. But our time has come. This is just one of our remote outposts.}
{254}{}{我们来自加利福尼亚州。以前，他们安静地坐在地堡里，不干涉世俗事务。但我们的时代已经到来。这只是我们的一个偏远前哨基地。}
### {255}{}{Tell the story of the Brotherhood.}
{255}{}{讲述兄弟会的故事。}
### {256}{}{Well, General Maxon gathered us during the Great War and brought us to the old military base. We went through the hardest times there. Several generations have passed, now his descendant rules our ranks.}
{256}{}{马克森将军在二战期间召集了我们，并把我们带到了旧的军事基地。我们在那里度过了最艰难的时期。几代人过去了，现在他的后代统治着我们的队伍。}
### {257}{}{What is your mission? What are you trying to achieve in the end?}
{257}{}{你的使命是什么？你最终想达到什么目的？}
### {258}{}{The main goal of our order is the search and preservation of ancient technologies in order to someday restore order to the lands of a once great country. However, there are numerous disputes about this in the order. For a long time we did not dare to start our "crusade", only recent events in California forced us to reconsider our strategy and come out of the shadows.}
{258}{}{我们秩序的主要目标是寻找和保护古代技术，以便有朝一日恢复一个曾经伟大国家的土地秩序。然而，该命令中对此存在许多争议。在很长一段时间里，我们不敢开始我们的“十字军东征”，只有最近在加利福尼亚发生的事件迫使我们重新考虑我们的战略，走出阴影。}
### {259}{}{Countries? What country are we talking about?}
{259}{}{国家？我们在谈论哪个国家？}
### {260}{}{United States of America.}
{260}{}{美利坚合众国。}
### {261}{}{What are these events in California that you mentioned?}
{261}{}{你提到的加利福尼亚州的这些事件是什么？}
### {262}{}{A big story about the Creator and his army. Do you want to know the details?}
{262}{}{一个关于造物主和他的军队的大故事。你想知道细节吗？}
### {263}{}{Yes, please tell me.}
{263}{}{是的，请告诉我。}
### {264}{}{This story doesn't interest me. We'd better change the subject.}
{264}{}{这个故事我不感兴趣。我们最好换个话题。}
### {265}{}{Um, let's go back a bit.}
{265}{}{嗯，让我们回到过去。}
### {266}{}{Thank you. This concludes the conversation about the Brotherhood.}
{266}{}{非常感谢。关于兄弟会的对话到此结束。}
### {267}{}{Since I am now also a member of the Brotherhood, I want to hear an honest answer. What is the management really trying to achieve?}
{267}{}{既然我现在也是兄弟会的成员，我希望听到一个诚实的回答。管理层真正想要实现的是什么？}
### {268}{}{I didn't say that, but our main goal in Arizona is to get nuclear material for the general staff in California. The General Staff needs other resources as well. Without them, the order will last for some time, but sooner or later our isolation will come to an end. And then the Brotherhood will be forced to take drastic measures to provide for itself.}
{268}{}{我没有这么说，但我们在亚利桑那州的主要目标是为加州的总参谋部提供核材料。总参谋部也需要其他资源。如果没有他们，秩序将持续一段时间，但我们的孤立迟早会结束。然后，兄弟会将被迫采取激烈的措施来养活自己。}
### {269}{}{That is, first the order needs to survive, for which the locals can go to the expense? Oh, yes, I understand now.}
{269}{}{也就是说，首先订单需要生存，当地人可以为此付出代价吗？哦，是的，我现在明白了。}

### {270}{}{The creator is a tyrant. Considering himself something like a god, he opened his own church and created a cult around his person. His sect included many people. Some of them were used as material for experiments. The most successful copies subsequently made up the personal army of the Creator.}
{270}{}{创造者是暴君。他认为自己有点像上帝，于是开设了自己的教堂，并在自己的周围建立了一个邪教。他的教派包括许多人。其中一些被用作实验材料。最成功的复制品随后组成了造物主的个人军队。}
### {271}{}{An army of super mutants? The Creator must have been pretty damn smart.}
{271}{}{超级变种人大军？造物主一定非常聪明。}
### {272}{}{And, of course, you didn't want to share power with the dictator?}
{272}{}{当然，你不想和独裁者分享权力？}
### {273}{}{Our scouts studied the situation, risking their lives. The church was destroyed. The army is defeated. The remnants of the army settled in the wastelands, but our detachments quickly found them and erased them from history.}
{273}{}{我们的侦察兵冒着生命危险研究了情况。教堂被毁了。军队被打败了。军队的残余部队定居在荒原上，但我们的分遣队很快找到了他们，并将他们从历史上抹去。}
### {274}{}{It looks like you know how to wage war. If you think about it, no one in modern Arizona can compare with you.}
{274}{}{看起来你知道如何发动战争。如果你仔细想想，现代亚利桑那州没有人能与你相比。}
### {275}{}{Arizona doesn't know problems of this magnitude yet. You're lucky we're here. However, we have slightly different goals.}
{275}{}{亚利桑那州还不知道如此严重的问题。你很幸运我们在这里。然而，我们的目标略有不同。}
### {276}{}{Thank you so much for the story.}
{276}{}{非常感谢你的故事。}

### {279}{}{I do not believe. Surely the Brotherhood has embellished its merits.}
{279}{}{我不相信。毫无疑问，兄弟会夸大了自己的优点。}
### {280}{}{Are you saying I'm lying? When you're in California, ask the locals. However, everyone in the Wastelands will say that it was he who detonated the nuclear bomb. Like, for example, that story with the Asylum-Seeker who was just our mercenary.}
{280}{}{你是说我在撒谎吗？当你在加州时，问问当地人。然而，荒原上的每个人都会说是他引爆了核弹。比如，关于寻求庇护者的故事，他只是我们的雇佣兵。}
### {281}{}{Indeed, it is not a good idea to believe private rumors.}
{281}{}{事实上，相信私人谣言不是一个好主意。}
### {282}{}{Exactly. Your words are nothing more than your words.}
{282}{}{确切地你的话不过是你的话。}

### {288}{}{What kind of person is he?}
{288}{}{他是什么样的人？}
### {289}{}{Be afraid of Dixon. It is enough for him to snap his finger to turn someone's village into dust. That's all you need to know, Native.}
{289}{}{害怕Dixon。只要他动动手指，就能把别人的村庄变成尘土。这就是你需要知道的全部，Native。}
### {1289}{}{Be afraid of Dixon. It is enough for him to snap his finger to turn someone's village into dust. That's all you need to know, native.}
{1289}{}{害怕Dixon。只要他动动手指，就能把别人的村庄变成尘土。这就是你需要知道的，本地人。}
### {290}{}{Can you tell me about your commander-in-chief?}
{290}{}{你能告诉我你的总司令吗？}
### {291}{}{General Dixon is one of the supreme paladins of the Brotherhood. His combat and political experience will be the envy of any modern ruler.}
{291}{}{迪克森将军是兄弟会的最高圣骑士之一。他的战斗和政治经验将是任何现代统治者所羡慕的。}
### {292}{}{Eh, I see.}
{292}{}{呃，我明白了。}
### {293}{}{General Dixon is one of the supreme paladins of the Brotherhood. Only a few people in the entire order have such extensive experience in conducting combat operations and long campaigns away from home. The Brotherhood Council trusts him.}
{293}{}{迪克森将军是兄弟会的最高圣骑士之一。整个秩序中只有少数人在海外进行作战行动和长期战役方面有如此丰富的经验。兄弟会委员会信任他。}
### {294}{}{And you?}
{294}{}{你呢？}
### {295}{}{Thank you. I shouldn't know more.}
{295}{}{非常感谢。我不应该知道更多。}
### {296}{}{He's a fighter, and I'm a clerk. Because of this, we often do not find understanding. Dixon does not tolerate bureaucracy and is prone to solving problems quickly. It is easier for him to capture than to negotiate.}
{296}{}{他是个斗士，而我是个职员。正因为如此，我们常常找不到理解。Dixon不容忍官僚主义，并且倾向于快速解决问题。对他来说，抓捕比谈判更容易。}
### {297}{}{And the General Staff trusts a stubborn soldier?}
{297}{}{总参谋部信任一个固执的士兵？}
### {298}{}{The Council of Elders does not approve of some of Dixon's measures. But our outpost is too far from the general Staff and performs too complex a task to rely on conventional methods. Therefore, the general is endowed with special powers that greatly untie his fists. And I think it is quite justified.}
{298}{}{长老会不赞成Dixon的一些措施。但我们的前哨基地离总参谋部太远，执行的任务太复杂，无法依靠常规方法。因此，将军被赋予了特殊的权力，可以极大地放松他的拳头。我认为这是非常合理的。}
### {299}{}{Thank you. This clarifies a lot.}
{299}{}{非常感谢。这说明了很多。}
### {300}{}{I think I'm under your command now. I am also a clerk.}
{300}{}{我想我现在在你的指挥之下。我也是一名职员。}
### {301}{}{I'm glad you're choosing enlightenment over guns. Let me help you in this endeavor.}
{301}{}{我很高兴你选择启蒙而不是枪支。让我在这方面帮助你。}
### {302}{}{I'm listening.}
{302}{}{我在听。}
### {303}{}{Oh, please.}
{303}{}{哦，求你了。}
### {304}{}{This is an analytical neuro link for a Pip Fight. The standard model used by our scribes. Use it to be more attentive and smarter.}
{304}{}{这是皮普打斗的神经分析环节。我们的抄写员使用的标准模型。用它来变得更专注、更聪明。}
### {305}{}{Thank you, Sister Maura. I will use this valuable gift for the benefit of the Brotherhood.}
{305}{}{谢谢你，莫拉修女。我将用这份珍贵的礼物来造福兄弟会。}
### {306}{}{Well okay. Maybe it will come in handy somewhere.}

### {316}{}{You should choose your expressions more carefully. And no, the Brotherhood doesn't think so. Thanks to Dixon's sensitive policy, Arizona got an opportunity to develop. The local savages have education, medicine and production at a level that has not been here for almost a hundred years. Isn't this a miracle?}
{316}{}{你应该更仔细地选择你的表达方式。不，兄弟会不这么认为。多亏了Dixon的敏感政策，亚利桑那州获得了发展的机会。当地的野蛮人拥有近百年来从未有过的教育、医疗和生产水平。这不是一个奇迹吗？}

{325}{}{Dixon在玩一场不人道的游戏。通过他在当地的附庸，他强加暴政，掠夺资源，获取技术，实行奴隶制。}
### {326}{}{I don't even know what to say. Perhaps we'll leave it on his conscience.}
{326}{}{我甚至不知道该说什么。也许我们会把这件事留给他的良心。}
### {327}{}{Partly I agree. However, all these are forced measures. The locals have lost their roots with the Old World. They went wild, lost heart. Without our intervention, it will take centuries before they themselves can return to the bosom of civilization.}
{327}{}{我部分同意。然而，所有这些都是强制性措施。当地人已经失去了与旧世界的联系。他们疯了，失去了信心。如果没有我们的干预，他们自己还需要几个世纪才能回到文明的怀抱。}

### {331}{}{Not without that. But your expansion does not so much give people freedom and development, as it breeds slavery and destroys traditions.}
{331}{}{没有这一点。但你们的扩张并没有给人们带来自由和发展，反而滋生了奴隶制，破坏了传统。}
