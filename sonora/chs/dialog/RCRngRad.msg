### {100}{}{Here is a radio operator.}
{100}{}{这是一位无线电操作员。}
### {101}{}{You see a woman with a prim look.}
{101}{}{你看到一个女人一本正经。}

### {200}{}{Hi.}
{200}{}{你好}
### {201}{}{Bye.}
{201}{}{再见}

### {210}{}{What's the matter?}
{210}{}{怎么了？}
### {211}{}{Bye.}
{211}{}{再见}

### {220}{}{Tell me about yourself.}
{220}{}{告诉我你自己。}
### {221}{}{Jane's communications officer.}
{221}{}{简的通讯员。}
### {222}{}{How did you become a ranger?}
{222}{}{你是如何成为一名护林员的？}
### {223}{}{So it happened.}
{223}{}{事情就这样发生了。}
### {224}{}{Uh, a lot has become clear.}
{224}{}{很多事情都清楚了。}
### {225}{}{Any more stupid questions?}
{225}{}{还有什么愚蠢的问题吗？}
### {226}{}{Yes.}
{226}{}{对}
### {227}{}{No.}
{227}{}{不}
### {228}{}{}
{228}{}{error : string is empty}
### {229}{}{Let's change the subject.}
{229}{}{让我们换个话题。}

### {230}{}{What is this place?}
{230}{}{这是什么地方？}
### {231}{}{This is a radio station. Ra-di-o-station. Don't confuse it with radiation... Damn, it looks like you're going to have to explain this for a long time. In short, we use this equipment to communicate remotely with our patrols.}
{231}{}{这是一个广播电台。Ra-di-o--station。不要把它和辐射混为一谈...该死，看来你要解释很长一段时间了。简而言之，我们使用这种设备与巡逻队进行远程通信。}
### {232}{}{It's amazing that all this technology still works.}
{232}{}{令人惊讶的是，所有这些技术仍然有效。}
### {233}{}{Yes. Works. And it keeps "afloat" only thanks to external relations. We get spare parts from trade caravans, and energy from the local dam.}
{233}{}{对作品它之所以能够维持“漂浮”，仅仅得益于外部关系。我们从贸易商队获得备件，从当地水坝获得能源。}
### {234}{}{In the wastelands, few have the technology of the Old World.}
{234}{}{在荒原上，很少有人拥有旧世界的技术。}
### {235}{}{That's for sure. Technology is a necessity, not a luxury. Many are even afraid of such places. But in our case, knowledge about this technology has been passed down for generations and recorded on holodisks. For us, this is also a relic in some way.}
{235}{}{这是肯定的。技术是必需品，而不是奢侈品。许多人甚至害怕这样的地方。但在我们的案例中，关于这项技术的知识已经代代相传，并记录在全息盘上。对我们来说，这在某种程度上也是一个遗迹。}
### {236}{}{And where are all the staff? There's almost no one here.}
{236}{}{所有的员工都在哪里？这里几乎没有人。}
### {237}{}{I have enough chatter on the radio. And even more so, I'm not going to tolerate outsiders here.}
{237}{}{我在收音机里有足够多的闲聊。更重要的是，我不会容忍这里的外人。}
### {238}{}{Do you want to go somewhere to relax?}
{238}{}{你想去什么地方放松一下吗？}
### {239}{}{For example? I don't mind shooting coyotes, but I don't care about your company.}
{239}{}{例如我不介意射杀郊狼，但我不在乎你的陪伴。}
### {240}{}{You seem to be mad at people?}
{240}{}{你好像生人的气？}
### {241}{}{Maybe so. There are only fools around. When another cadet causes problems or another sergeant goes against the commander, you involuntarily get disappointed in people.}
{241}{}{也许是这样。周围只有傻瓜。当另一名学员引发问题或另一名中士与指挥官发生冲突时，你会不由自主地对人们感到失望。}
### {242}{}{What is this field with crosses near the station?}
{242}{}{车站附近这片有十字架的田地是什么？}
### {243}{}{Cemetery. Rangers and their loved ones are buried there. I hope you're not going to desecrate the graves, otherwise it will be the last mistake in your short life.}
{243}{}{墓地游骑兵和他们的亲人被埋葬在那里。我希望你不要亵渎坟墓，否则这将是你短暂生命中的最后一个错误。}
### {244}{}{Can I ask another question about this one... a radio station?}
{244}{}{我能再问一个关于这个的问题吗...电台？}

### {250}{}{I need radio codes.}
{250}{}{我需要无线电代码。}
### {251}{}{This is official information, ordinary peasants are not supposed to know.}
{251}{}{这是官方信息，一般农民不应该知道。}
### {252}{}{I'm a rookie.}
{252}{}{我是个菜鸟。}
### {253}{}{Okay, forget it.}
{253}{}{好吧，算了。}
### {254}{}{Then shove your codes deeper.}
{254}{}{然后把你的代码推得更深。}
### {255}{}{Then I'm sorry. Here are the codes and the cipher of the main negotiation frequencies. Don't you dare show it to anyone except other rangers.}
{255}{}{那我很抱歉。以下是主要协商频率的代码和密码。除了其他护林员，你不敢把它展示给任何人。}
### {256}{}{Thank you, Officer.}
{256}{}{谢谢你，警官。}
### {257}{}{I know without you.}
{257}{}{我知道没有你。}

### {260}{}{The dam is destroyed. Why are you still here?}
{260}{}{大坝被毁了。你为什么还在这里？}
### {261}{}{In this difficult time, my work is especially important. The management is looking for a new place to base, and without remote communication they will be blind in their search.}
{261}{}{在这个困难时期，我的工作尤为重要。管理层正在寻找一个新的基地，如果没有远程通信，他们将盲目寻找。}
### {262}{}{[Next]}
{262}{}{[下一个]}
### {263}{}{In any case, it will not last long, because the resource of backup generators is limited. When they run out or break down, the radio station will become useless. However, from the top there is a good view of the valley.}
{263}{}{无论如何，它不会持续太久，因为备用发电机的资源有限。当它们用完或坏了时，广播电台就会变得毫无用处。然而，从顶部可以看到山谷的美景。}
### {264}{}{I see.}
{264}{}{我明白了。}

### {270}{}{They say it was thanks to you that the spy who was hiding with the farmers was discovered? Good job.}
{270}{}{他们说是因为你才发现了那个和农民一起躲藏的间谍？干得好}
### {271}{}{Glad to try.}
{271}{}{很高兴尝试。}
### {1271}{}{Glad to try.}
{1271}{}{很高兴尝试。}
### {272}{}{It's nothing.}
{272}{}{没什么。}
### {273}{}{So it was thanks to you that Jason got out of the clutches of the Jackals? Well done. We thought we'd lost everyone from that patrol.}
{273}{}{杰森是不是因为你才摆脱了豺狼的魔掌？干得好。我们以为我们已经失去了巡逻队的所有人。}
### {274}{}{Glad to try.}
{274}{}{很高兴尝试。}
### {1274}{}{Glad to try.}
{1274}{}{很高兴尝试。}
### {275}{}{You're welcome.}
{275}{}{不客气。}

#Story quest
### {278}{}{Really?}
{278}{}{真正地}
### {279}{}{The fact is that half of the signal amplifiers have long been out of order. We need to fix them or find a replacement for them. Then the connection will be enough to control the territory up to Phoenix... Well, or at least to San Brahmin.}
{279}{}{事实是，一半的信号放大器长期以来一直处于故障状态。我们需要修复它们或找到替代品。然后连接将足以控制领土直到凤凰城...好吧，至少对圣婆罗门来说。}
### {280}{}{Commander Helford sent me.}
{280}{}{赫尔福德司令派我来。}
### {281}{}{Great. The station is in need of repair, and Helford is sending peasants for this! Do you have any idea how a radio station works?}
{281}{}{太棒了车站需要修理，而赫尔福德正派农民来修理！你知道电台是怎么运作的吗？}
### {282}{}{I'll figure it out. What needs to be done?}
{282}{}{我会想清楚的。需要做什么？}
### {283}{}{Now our guys have a lot of work on the eastern and southeastern front. But radio communication does not reach some outposts. Although I could.}
{283}{}{现在我们的人在东线和东南线有很多工作要做。但无线电通信无法到达一些前哨基地。虽然我可以。}
### {284}{}{Where is the broken equipment located?}
{284}{}{坏掉的设备在哪里？}
### {285}{}{Go down to the utility room under the antenna. I'm afraid there won't be enough cans and forks to fix it. Perhaps the scavengers will have useful parts in Garage City, but they don't like rangers. Can you help us with this problem?}
{285}{}{去天线下面的杂物间。恐怕没有足够的罐头和叉子来修理它。也许拾荒者在车库城会有有用的零件，但他们不喜欢护林员。你能帮我们解决这个问题吗？}
### {286}{}{I'm going to see what it is...}
{286}{}{我要去看看是什么...}
### {287}{}{Wait a minute. You're probably going to the Garage for the parts, right? Then there is one more request. We lost patrolmen in that area. Try to find out what happened to them. Our communication does not reach far, but near the radios will be able to detect each other's signals. If you manage, the Rangers will be grateful to you.}
{287}{}{等一下。你可能会去车库取零件，对吧？然后还有一个请求。我们在那个地区失去了巡逻员。试着找出他们发生了什么事。我们的通信不远，但在附近的无线电将能够检测到彼此的信号。如果你成功了，流浪者队会感激你的。}
### {288}{}{I will definitely find them.}
{288}{}{我一定会找到他们的。}
### {289}{}{I can't promise anything.}
{289}{}{我什么都不能答应。}
### {290}{}{The radio transmitter has been restored.}
{290}{}{无线电发射机已恢复。}
### {291}{}{The echo source has been destroyed. It was a spy relay.}
{291}{}{回声源已被破坏。这是一次间谍接力。}
### {292}{}{Remind me what I needed to do.}
{292}{}{提醒我需要做什么。}
### {293}{}{Still, it's difficult for your mind, isn't it? Find the source that creates the "echo" in our broadcasts. To do this, go to the wasteland to the east of our base. You will need to monitor the signal on the walkie-talkie to determine the location of the source.}
{293}{}{尽管如此，这对你的大脑来说还是很困难的，不是吗？找到在我们的广播中产生“回声”的来源。要做到这一点，去我们基地以东的荒地。您需要监控对讲机上的信号，以确定信号源的位置。}
### {294}{}{Great. Let's see what came of it...}
{294}{}{太棒了让我们看看结果如何...}
### {295}{}{[Next]}
{295}{}{[下一个]}
### {296}{}{Amazing! Now we will be able to expand control over the territory... Wait a minute. Do you hear that?}
{296}{}{太神了现在我们将能够扩大对领土的控制...等一下。你听到了吗？}
### {297}{}{Echo? Is something duplicating your signal?}
{297}{}{回响有什么东西在复制你的信号吗？}
### {298}{}{It looks like it... The signal is very low, coming in an easterly direction. We couldn't detect it before. It may be a mistake of the new equipment, but... look, we need to know exactly what it is. This hindrance should not be ignored.}
{298}{}{看起来…信号很低，向东。我们以前没发现。这可能是新设备的错误，但是...看，我们需要确切地知道它是什么。这个障碍不应该被忽视。}
### {299}{}{[Next]}
{299}{}{[下一个]}
### {300}{}{Go to the signal bearing and find out what causes the radio echo. I'll give you a walkie-talkie to find him.}
{300}{}{转到信号方位，找出无线电回波的原因。我给你一部对讲机去找他。}
### {301}{}{Eh, and it already seemed to me that the task was completed ...}
{301}{}{呃，我觉得任务已经完成了...}

### {302}{}{What a surprise! It seemed to me that only we possess the technology of such powerful radio broadcasts. Tell Captain Helford about the results of the operation immediately.}
{302}{}{真是个惊喜！在我看来，只有我们拥有如此强大的无线电广播技术。立即将行动结果告诉赫尔福德上尉。}
### {303}{}{[Next]}
{303}{}{[下一个]}
### {304}{}{And you have the makings. Tell Commander Helford about the results of the operation.}
{304}{}{你有这个素质。把行动结果告诉赫尔福德指挥官。}
### {305}{}{Yes!}
{305}{}{对}
