{264}{}{我听过关于这个避难所的各种传说。有人说凤凰城的统治者在那里建立了一个秘密实验室。还有一个人――从核战争开始，避难所就一直住着真正的鬼魂。也许它根本不存在。}
### {265}{}{Sorry to hear that.}
{265}{}{很抱歉听到这个消息。}
### {266}{}{If you are going to go in search of this legend, then I advise you to start with the scavenger Bob. He lives in a slum east of here and knows the Phoenix neighborhood like no one else.}

{267}{}{谢谢你，你帮了我很多。}
### {268}{}{You're of no use. Maybe at least this Bob knows something.}

{270}{}{这座城市的规模惊人。但我需要找到我的亲戚。}

### {277}{}{I personally know a dozen Migels. One of them is a woman at all. But if your relative came from far away, then he could change his name. I'm afraid it won't be easy to find him. Try asking the mercenary guild. They are also engaged in the search for people there.}
{277}{}{我个人认识十几个米格尔。其中一个根本就是女人。但如果你的亲戚来自远方，那么他可以改名。恐怕要找到他并不容易。试着问问雇佣兵公会。他们还在那里搜寻人员。}

#Tips and rumors
### {300}{}{For several years now, a cap currency has been operating in the city. It's like dollars before the Great War, and the Cathedral of Fire acts as its guarantor. However, many still do not trust such an idea.}
{300}{}{几年来，该市一直实行上限货币。这就像大战前的美元，而火之大教堂是它的担保人。然而，许多人仍然不相信这样的想法。}
### {301}{}{Speaking of caps. Here's another one. What about pre-war dollars?}
{301}{}{说到瓶盖。这是另一个。战前的美元呢？}
### {302}{}{There are problems with this. Usually no one uses them, but for some reason the casino buys up all the old currency. If you find a bill, bring it to the cashier, maybe you'll get a couple of caps from it.}
{302}{}{这是有问题的。通常没有人使用它们，但出于某种原因，赌场买下了所有的旧货币。如果你找到一张账单，把它带到收银台，也许你会从中得到几个瓶盖。}
### {303}{}{Have you ever been to the Atomic Fever Casino? It's worth taking a look and spending a couple of caps to assess your chances. But don't let luck fool you. After all, no matter how hard you try, the casino will still win.}
{303}{}{你去过原子热赌场吗？值得一看，花上几场比赛来评估你的机会。但不要让运气愚弄你。毕竟，不管你怎么努力，赌场还是会赢的。}
### {304}{}{Even without luck, I can give you a cover. By the way, who runs everything there? Maybe I can make some extra money there.}
{304}{}{即使没有运气，我也可以给你一个掩护。顺便问一下，那里的一切都是谁管理的？也许我可以在那里赚些外快。}
### {305}{}{I doubt the casino will accept a man from the street. They have a kind of family there. And the head of this family, Don Diego, is very selective about the choice of employees. If you want to work for him, you'll have to ingratiate yourself with one of his henchmen first. Or have a good reputation in the city.}
{305}{}{我怀疑赌场是否会接受一个街头男子。他们在那里有一家人。这个家族的首领唐？迭戈对员工的选择非常挑剔。如果你想为他工作，你必须先讨好他的一个党羽。或者在城市里有良好的声誉。}
### {306}{}{Be careful when you find yourself in the eastern slums. Orris's gang runs everything there, it's better not to mess with it.}

### {309}{}{The atomic scientists raised prices again and gave an ultimatum to Aaron. I don't know who will win this battle, but the city will have a hard time anyway.}
{309}{}{原子科学家们再次提高了价格，并向亚伦发出了最后通牒。我不知道谁会赢得这场战斗，但这座城市无论如何都会很艰难。}

{310}{}{如果你告诉我那个地区的情况，我再给你一个瓶盖。}

{311}{}{车站周围有一条有毒的垃圾护城河，陷阱和铁丝网。我也知道地铁直达车站。最有可能的是，它还塞满了对付不速之客的陷阱。}

{314}{}{不多他们用不同的方式谈论他，但很明显，这个男人很霸道，痴迷于他的想法。他们还说，他正在服用某种药物，没有这些药物他就无法生存。}
### {315}{}{Recently, corpses of people have been found more and more often in the subway. Nobody used to go there except squatters. But they have been harmless so far.}
{315}{}{最近，人们在地铁里发现的尸体越来越多。以前除了棚户区居民没有人去那里。但到目前为止，它们是无害的。}
### {316}{}{Here's another cap. Tell me about these squatters.}
{316}{}{这是另一个瓶盖。告诉我这些棚户区的情况。}
### {317}{}{Strange guys living in sewers. They dislike the outside world and only occasionally come to the surface to exchange rat carcasses. If you happen to communicate with them, my advice is just give them something you need, it will immediately loosen their tongue.}
{317}{}{住在下水道里的怪家伙。它们不喜欢外面的世界，只是偶尔浮出水面交换老鼠尸体。如果你碰巧和他们交流，我的建议是给他们一些你需要的东西，他们会立刻放松。}
### {318}{}{One alien type told legends about some kind of Vault, where there is plenty of food and operating technologies. Those who fell for his stories and went in search of this refuge have gone missing.}

{323}{}{来自格兰德之家的传言并没有说谎――这座城市被不断的权力斗争撕裂了。太阳一升起，一位市长就接替另一位市长。当你处于这种情况时，要做好准备，以免上当受骗或陷入麻烦。}

{324}{}{有很多关于住在南方的铁匠的传言。大篷车去那里，但很少有人能和这个神秘的人交易。}
### {325}{}{When the caravans began to go south, bandits immediately lined up along the highways. Highway workers, as they are called, rob and kill travelers.}
{325}{}{当大篷车开始向南行驶时，土匪立即沿着高速公路排起了长队。公路工人，正如他们所说的，抢劫并杀害旅行者。}
