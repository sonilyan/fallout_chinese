#{100}{}{You see a caravaneer Bobby.}
{100}{}{你看到一个商队队员鲍比。}
#{101}{}{You see a badly beaten up caravan merchant.}
{101}{}{你看到一个挨打的商队商人。}
#{110}{}{::moans::}
{110}{}{●呻吟声：}
#{111}{}{Oh, my teeth hurt...}
{111}{}{哦，我的牙齿疼...}
#{112}{}{Time to quit this job}
{112}{}{该辞职了}
#{113}{}{It's the first time in my career}
{113}{}{这是我职业生涯中的第一次}
#{114}{}{All of them should be put under tribunal!}
{114}{}{所有人都应该接受审判！}
#{115}{}{How can you do that!}
{115}{}{你怎么能这样！}
#{116}{}{Damn, I feel like shit...}
{116}{}{妈的，我感觉糟透了...}
#{117}{}{Just like that - in front of everyone!}
{117}{}{就这样-在大家面前！}
#{118}{}{Bastards! Bastards!}
{118}{}{混蛋！混蛋！}
#{119}{}{They're worse than raiders}
{119}{}{他们比袭击者还坏}
#{120}{}{Even the Reno thugs are not that fierce}
{120}{}{连雷诺暴徒也没那么厉害}
#{121}{}{How did I ever get plunged so hard}
{121}{}{我怎么会这么用力地跳水}
#{122}{}{As soon as I stand on my feet - I'll go straight to Vegas immediately. Immediately!}
{122}{}{我一站起来就马上去维加斯。马上！}
#{123}{}{Just started talking - and got one right in the face!}
{123}{}{刚开始说话-一拳打在脸上！}
#{124}{}{Why me?!}
{124}{}{为什么是我？！}
#{125}{}{From now on I should sidestep this settlement}
{125}{}{从现在起我应该避开这个解决方案}
#{200}{}{[You see a beaten up man; he's hurt, he groans, but no one helps him for some reason]}
{200}{}{[你看到一个挨打的人；他受伤了，他呻吟着，但是没有人因为某种原因帮助他]}
#{201}{}{Don't twitch, I'll heal you. I'm a doctor.}
{201}{}{别抽搐，我会治好你的。我是医生。}
#{202}{}{Hold on, I'll call the doctor to help.}
{202}{}{等等，我会叫医生来帮忙的。}
#{203}{}{Well, I have nothing to do with, and I don't care.}
{203}{}{好吧，我跟你没关系，我也不在乎。}
#{204}{}{[Pulls your hand away] What kind of doctor are you?! Don't bother, you'll make everything worse.}
{204}{}{你是什么医生？！别麻烦了，你会让事情变得更糟的。}
#{205}{}{Then, you'll continue to suffer.}
{205}{}{然后，你会继续受苦。}
#{206}{}{[Angrily pulls your hand away] I don't accept handouts for militaries' favorites. Leave me alone!}
{206}{}{[愤怒地把手拉开]我不接受军方喜欢的施舍。别管我！}
#{207}{}{So this is what you like...}
{207}{}{所以这就是你喜欢的...}
#{208}{}{Thanks for the help}
{208}{}{谢谢你的帮助}
#{209}{}{See ya at Vegas, maybe.}
{209}{}{也许在维加斯见。}
#{210}{}{Oh... That's so much better. Thanks for the help.}
{210}{}{哦...好多了。谢谢你的帮助。}
#{211}{}{Now tell me, who painted you like this?}
{211}{}{告诉我，谁把你画成这样的？}
#{212}{}{A couple of soldiers from the garrison! Who else?}
{212}{}{驻军的几个士兵！还有谁？}
#{213}{}{I bet you yourself provoked them. Isn't that right?}
{213}{}{我打赌是你自己惹的祸。不是吗？}
#{214}{}{For real? How could they! They didn't have the reason to do that, right?}
{214}{}{真的吗？他们怎么可能！他们没有理由这么做，对吧？}
#{215}{}{Pretty strange discipline for militarized settlement.}
{215}{}{军事化定居点的纪律很奇怪。}
#{216}{}{Are you out of your mind?! Why should I do that?! It doesn't matter how you act, you'll still get a boot in the face for just like that.}
{216}{}{你疯了吗？！我为什么要这么做？！不管你怎么做，你还是会因为那样的行为而受到惩罚的。}
#{217}{}{You're a good person, and still don't get it. They don't need a *reason*. They'll come up with something when needed.}
{217}{}{你是个好人，但还是不明白。他们不需要理由。他们会在需要的时候想出办法的。}
#{218}{}{Yes, and many are still pretty delusional. But the truth is that it's already in the past. Those are not people who think about your safety. Just give them a reason - they'll rob you to the skin.}
{218}{}{是的，而且很多人还是有点妄想症。但事实是这已经是过去了。那些人不会考虑你的安全。给他们一个理由-他们会把你抢走的。}
#{219}{}{Why are the locals so fierce?}
{219}{}{当地人怎么这么凶？}
#{220}{}{Because of disorder. And they think high about themselves. Who has better gun and thicker armor is the hero of wasteland. Get it? So, they behave like masters in these parts.}
{220}{}{因为混乱。他们对自己的评价很高。谁有更好的枪和更厚的盔甲是荒原英雄。了解了？所以，它们在这些部位表现得像主人。}
#{221}{}{So why did they do this to you?}
{221}{}{那他们为什么这样对你？}
#{222}{}{For my pistol and some change. I shouldn't have shown it before them. Someone ratted to militaries, and soon came that Jimmy with his gang. Requested to hand over the gun. I refused - and here's what happened.}
{222}{}{为了我的手枪和一些零钱。我不该在他们面前展示。有人背叛了军队，很快吉米和他的帮派就来了。要求交出枪。我拒绝了-事情是这样的。}
#{223}{}{Tell me about your gun.}
{223}{}{告诉我你的枪。}
#{224}{}{Who's that Jimmy and where to find him?}
{224}{}{那个吉米是谁？在哪能找到他？}
#{225}{}{Is this forbidden to carry a gun in these parts?}
{225}{}{这些地方禁止携带枪支吗？}
#{226}{}{Now I get it. Okay, bye.}
{226}{}{现在我明白了。好的，再见。}
#{227}{}{"Desert Eagle" with leather grip and improved barrel. Mutated ant falls dead from one shot. Great gun.}
{227}{}{“沙漠鹰”皮革抓地力和改进桶。变异的蚂蚁一枪就死了。很棒的枪。}
#{228}{}{One of privates. He always hangs around the checkpoint. Young and brassy bastard.}
{228}{}{一个士兵。他总是在检查站附近闲逛。又年轻又性感的混蛋。}
#{229}{}{No! You can't walk around carrying weapons only within their garrison. They'll shoot you up for this. As this is free parking, no such rules applied here. But does Jimmy care?}
{229}{}{不！你不能只在他们的驻军里带着武器到处走。他们会为此向你开枪的。因为这是免费停车，所以这里没有这样的规定。但是吉米在乎吗？}
#{230}{}{Hey, thanks for the help. Soon I'll leave this place and try to not come back.}
{230}{}{嘿，谢谢你的帮助。很快我就会离开这个地方，尽量不回来。}
#{231}{}{Hey, thanks for the help. Soon I'll leave this place and try to not come back. I miss my gun, though. It's not reasonable to walk in the wastes without a gun.}
{231}{}{嘿，谢谢你的帮助。很快我就会离开这个地方，尽量不回来。不过，我的枪丢了。不带枪在荒地里走是不合理的。}
#{232}{}{Right. Bye.}
{232}{}{正确的。再见。}
#{233}{}{That Jimmy got what he deserved and now wants to send his apologies.}
{233}{}{吉米得到了他应得的，现在想表达他的歉意。}
#{234}{}{That Jimmy got what he deserved. We had a... Explanatory conversation.}
{234}{}{吉米得到了他应得的。我们有一个...解释性对话。}
#{235}{}{Tell me again, why did they beat you up.}
{235}{}{再说一遍，他们为什么打你。}
#{236}{}{For real? You're tough one! Who else could crank this out and press the soldier to the wall... Oh, by the way - did you manage to get back my belongings?}
{236}{}{真的吗？你是个坚强的人！还有谁能把这个弄出来把士兵推到墙上...哦，顺便问一下-你把我的东西拿回来了吗？}
#{237}{}{Here's your 200 bucks and a handgun.}
{237}{}{这是你的200块钱和一把手枪。}
#{238}{}{Here's your 200 bucks, but he didn't give the pistol.}
{238}{}{这是你的200块钱，但他没给你手枪。}
#{239}{}{Here's your handgun, but money weren't part of the deal.}
{239}{}{这是你的手枪，但钱不是交易的一部分。}
#{240}{}{Too bad, it's too late - couldn't retrieve nothing.}
{240}{}{太糟糕了，太晚了-什么都找不到。}
#{241}{}{My "Desert Eagle"?! Thank you! I'm so glad I met you! By the way, keep the money, consider it my appreciation for you help.}
{241}{}{我的“沙漠鹰”？！谢谢您！很高兴见到你！顺便说一句，把钱留着吧，谢谢你的帮助。}
#{242}{}{Thanks. Take care.}
{242}{}{谢谢。当心。}
#{243}{}{I knew it! They *already* managed to spend all the money. Though, I didn't have much cash. I'll earn twice as much from the first run. More importantly, my beloved "Desert Eagle" returned to me! You just saved me from depression! Thanks.}
{243}{}{我就知道！他们已经把所有的钱都花光了。不过，我没有多少现金。第一次跑步我会赚两倍的钱。更重要的是，我心爱的“沙漠鹰”回到了我身边！你刚刚把我从抑郁中救了出来！谢谢。}
#{244}{}{Yeah. Take care.}
{244}{}{是 啊。当心。}
#{245}{}{Well, I have to say goodbye to my "Desert Eagle"... I think, I'll fall into depression soon enough... You know, whatever happened there, I guess they got what they deserved. Here, take the half. [gives 100 bucks] You earned it. Thank you for everything! See you in Vegas, maybe.}
{245}{}{我得跟我的“沙漠鹰”说再见了...我想，我很快就会陷入抑郁...你知道，不管发生了什么，我想他们得到了应得的。来，拿一半。[给100块]你赢了。谢谢你所做的一切！也许在维加斯见。}
#{246}{}{Maybe so. Goodbye.}
{246}{}{也许是吧。再见。}
#{247}{}{Uh, bad luck. At least I'm in peace knowing that they got what they deserved. Thank you for everything! Other would've just passed by. See you in Vegas, maybe.}
{247}{}{呃，运气不好。至少我知道他们得到了应得的。谢谢你所做的一切！另一个可能只是路过。也许在维加斯见。}
#{248}{}{You're welcome.}
{248}{}{不客气。}
