#{116}{}{Okay, Tuco Bandito something-something, let??s talk about something else.}
{116}{}{好吧，图科强盗什么的，让我们谈谈别的。}
#{150}{}{I'm just going to say this: we don't need business from psychopaths like you. And you can tell Big Louie's other dogs the same thing!}
{150}{}{我要说的是：我们不需要像你这样的精神病患者做生意。你可以告诉大路易的其他狗同样的事情！}
#{151}{}{You'd better hope I don't find you out on the road... }
{151}{}{你最好希望我不会在路上发现你...}
#{152}{}{Fine. I don't need you anyway.}
{152}{}{好的。反正我也不需要你。}
#{153}{}{I'll knock those words out of your mouth, along with your teeth! [Punch him in the jaw]}
{153}{}{我要把你的话和你的牙齿一起打掉！[打他的下巴]}

#{158}{}{[The administrator stands up unsteadily, wiping blood from his mouth, and holds up a hand to the others. They reluctantly holster their weapons.] I haven't been hit like that since my days in the ring! I'll let that go... But there's still no place for you on the stagecoach.}
{158}{}{[管理者摇摇晃晃地站起来，擦去嘴里的血，向其他人举起一只手。他们不情愿地把武器装进枪套里。]自从我在拳击场的日子以来，我从来没有被打成那样！我会让它过去...但是在驿站马车上还是没有你的位置。}
#{159}{}{You'd better watch your mouth next time.}
{159}{}{下次你最好小心你的嘴。}
#{160}{}{We've got nothing more to say.}
{160}{}{我们没什么好说的了。}
#{161}{}{You know, there's respectable jobs for people who can punch like you. Better than being one of Louie's dogs.}
{161}{}{你知道，像你这样会打拳的人有体面的工作。总比做路易的狗强。}

{166}{}{[战斗]}
#{170}{}{Tell me about the package your coach "delivered" to Patrick.}
{170}{}{告诉我你教练给帕特里克的包裹。}
#{171}{}{We upheld the contract. The deal was to take the package to Reno, not to hand-deliver it to his door. The boy living in those slums across the street answered for it. If you want to track it down, look there, not here.}
{171}{}{我们维持了合同。协议是把包裹送到雷诺，而不是亲手送到他家门口。住在街对面那些贫民窟里的男孩应允了。如果你想找到它，看那里，而不是这里。}
#{172}{}{I'll go check it out.}
{172}{}{我去看看。}

#{217}{}{I didn't think there were any functional vehicles left.}
{217}{}{我不认为还有什么功能性车辆。}
#{218}{}{I don't blame you! The Nevada Express may have the last working buses in the world. Some people will tell you a technician in Wind of War is fixing up an old pickup truck, but you shouldn't take them seriously. If he had anything, we'd already know.}
{218}{}{我不怪你！内华达快车可能拥有世界上最后一班可以使用的公共汽车。有些人会告诉你一个技术人员在修理一辆旧皮卡，但你不应该把他们当回事。如果他有什么，我们早就知道了。}
#{219}{}{I see. Thank you.}
{219}{}{我懂了。非常感谢。}
#{220}{}{I could give you the full speech, but your time is valuable, am I right? I see you have a Pip-Boy, the mark of someone who has places to go and people to see! I'll give you this holodisk instead, so you can learn everything you need to know at your leisure!}
{220}{}{我可以给你完整的演讲，但你的时间很宝贵，对吗？我看到你有一个皮普男孩，一个有地方可去，有人可看的人的标志！我给你这个全息光盘，这样你就可以在空闲的时候学到你需要知道的一切！}
#{221}{}{Well, you're right about one thing: I definitely don't have the time to listen to you. Fine, I'll take the holodisk.}
{221}{}{嗯，有一件事你是对的：我绝对没有时间听你的。好吧，我要全息光盘。}

{301}{}{哦，我记得她！我怎么会忘记呢？我们并不是每天都能运送这么好的顾客！}
#{302}{}{Do you remember where she went?}
{302}{}{你记得她去哪儿了吗？}
#{303}{}{Hmm... Yes! It was Vegas! I remember, because it was unusual. Normally people plan a trip to Vegas carefully, but she ran up to us at the last moment. Most customers only do that if they're trying to get out without people knowing... Oh. [he suddenly looks alarmed and hands the photo back to you] I - I don't remember anything else.}
{303}{}{Hmm...对！那是维加斯！我记得，因为这是不寻常的。通常人们计划去维加斯旅行时都很小心，但她在最后一刻跑过来找我们。大多数顾客只有在他们想在别人不知道的情况下离开的时候才会这么做...哦。[他突然看起来很惊慌，把照片还给你]我-我什么都不记得了。}
#{304}{}{Don't worry, Tuco, that's all I need.}

#{310}{}{How reliable are your coaches?}
{310}{}{你的教练有多可靠？}
#{311}{}{You have nothing to worry about, I promise you! In fact, I know what you're thinking of. The biker attack, right? Well, that was the first and last time! Believe me, you're safer on our coaches than you are walking around Reno.}
{311}{}{你没什么好担心的，我保证！事实上，我知道你在想什么。骑自行车的袭击，对吧？嗯，那是第一次也是最后一次！相信我，你坐在我们的教练车上比在里诺转悠安全多了。}
#{312}{}{What biker attack?}
{312}{}{什么摩托车袭击？}
#{313}{}{Fine, I believe you. For now.}
{313}{}{好吧，我相信你。现在。}
#{314}{}{Oh, you don't know? One of our coaches was ambushed by bikers. Only two guards survived. But don't worry - they caught us by surprise once, but never again.}
{314}{}{哦，你不知道？我们的一个教练被摩托车手伏击了。只有两名警卫幸存。但别担心，他们曾让我们大吃一惊，但再也没有了。}
#{315}{}{What do you know about bikers?}
{315}{}{你对摩托车手了解多少？}
#{316}{}{They're shiftless outlaws that can't live in the cities. They rob people of old technology whenever they can. I wish I knew where they sleep, so I could rid the wasteland of them!}
{316}{}{他们是不能住在城市里的无赖。只要有可能，他们就会掠夺人们的旧技术。我真希望我知道他们睡在哪里，这样我就能把他们从荒地里赶走！}

#{322}{}{Good to know. Bye.}
{322}{}{很高兴知道。再见。}
#{323}{}{I wasn't on the rescue operation, so I don't know much myself. But I'll tell you what I can!}
{323}{}{我没有参加救援行动，所以我自己也不太清楚。但我会尽我所能告诉你！}
#{324}{}{Have you sent anyone to investigate?}
{324}{}{你派人去调查了吗？}
#{325}{}{Where are the survivors?}
{325}{}{幸存者在哪里？}
#{326}{}{Why are you so sure that you were attacked by bikers?}
{326}{}{为什么你这么肯定自己被骑自行车的人袭击了？}
#{327}{}{Okay, goodbye.}
{327}{}{好的，再见。}
#{328}{}{The coach called for help over the radio, but before our rescue team could even reach the attack site, they ran into survivors running the other way. They told the rescue team everything as they returned to Reno.}
{328}{}{教练通过无线电呼救，但我们的救援队还没来得及到达袭击地点，他们就遇到了从另一条路跑过来的幸存者。他们回到雷诺时把一切都告诉了救援队。}
#{329}{}{Two of the guards. They're off duty in the Silver Legacy's restaurant now, trying to recover from the shock. It'll be some time before I send them out again. I can't imagine how awful it must have been for them.}
{329}{}{两个警卫。他们现在在银遗产餐厅下班，试图从震惊中恢复过来。我还要过一段时间才能把它们送出去。我无法想象这对他们来说有多可怕。}
#{330}{}{The survivors told us so. We've always known the bikers are troublemakers, but now we know they are thieves and murderers as well! Frankly, it doesn't surprise me. They are the types that cannot survive in a lawful society.}
{330}{}{幸存者告诉我们的。我们一直都知道骑自行车的人是麻烦制造者，但现在我们知道他们也是小偷和杀人犯！坦白说，我并不感到惊讶。他们是无法在合法社会中生存的类型。}
#{331}{}{Do you have any evidence?}
{331}{}{你有证据吗？}
#{332}{}{Well... No, but no ordinary marauders could attack us and live. Each coach is well armored and staffed with a robot and several experienced guards. Only the bikers have the pre-war technology and vehicles to carry out this type of ambush.}
{332}{}{好...不，但是没有一个普通的掠夺者可以攻击我们并活下来。每辆车都装备精良，配备了一个机器人和几名经验丰富的警卫。只有骑自行车的人有战前的技术和车辆来进行这种伏击。}
#{333}{}{You lost an entire coach and didn't even investigate?!}
{333}{}{你失去了一整辆马车，却连调查都没有？！}
#{334}{}{My men are professionals! I trust their word! If they say it was bikers, then I believe them, whether or not they have evidence. Now, if you want to convince me they're wrong - THEN I'll need evidence!}
{334}{}{我的人是专业人士！我相信他们的话！如果他们说是骑自行车的，那我相信他们，不管他们有没有证据。现在，如果你想让我相信他们错了-那我就需要证据！}
#{335}{}{Fine, I'll investigate it myself. I'll find proof one way or the other.}
{335}{}{好吧，我自己调查。不管怎样我都会找到证据的。}
#{336}{}{Really? Well... I know our valued customers have to be sure! It's their discriminating tastes that bring them to the Nevada Express in the first place, after all! You should start with the head of the rescue team. He's on the second floor of the Silver Legacy right now.}
{336}{}{真正地？好...我知道我们尊贵的顾客一定要确定！毕竟，正是他们的鉴赏力把他们带到了内华达快车上！你应该从救援队队长开始。他现在在银遗产的二楼。}
#{337}{}{Fine.}
{337}{}{好的。}
#{338}{}{This is a terrible idea. I'm out of here.}
{338}{}{这是个糟糕的主意。我要走了。}

{339}{}{}
#{340}{}{Once more about the attack on the stagecoach.}
{340}{}{又一次关于对驿站马车的袭击。}
#{341}{}{Alright, but please know, there's no risk of this happening again. Next time, we shoot the bikers on sight. You can trust the Nevada Express with your safety!}
{341}{}{好吧，但请你知道，这种事不会再发生了。下一次，我们一看到就开枪。你可以相信内华达快车的安全！}
#{342}{}{Where do I find the man that led the rescue operation again?}
{342}{}{我在哪里能找到再次领导救援行动的那个人？}
#{343}{}{It's just across the street on the second floor of the Silver Legacy. His room is near the stairs and he's wearing metal armor.}
{343}{}{就在街对面的银遗产二楼。他的房间靠近楼梯，他穿着金属盔甲。}

#{346}{}{Thanks, that's all.}
{346}{}{谢谢，就这些。}
#{347}{}{I know who really attacked the stagecoach.}
{347}{}{我知道谁真正袭击了驿站马车。}
#{348}{}{Oh?}
{348}{}{哦？}
#{349}{}{This holodisk from the attack site explains it. It wasn't the bikers. It was your people.}
{349}{}{这张袭击现场的全息光盘解释了这一点。不是骑自行车的。是你的人。}
#{350}{}{Actually, I don't have the proof with me. Let me get back to you.}
{350}{}{事实上，我没有证据。我再打给你。}
#{351}{}{What?! But - let me see. [he takes the holodisk, disappears into the office, and returns in a state of rage] Those scum! Those traitors! Those - those - I can't believe we were betrayed like this! We gave them honest work, status, everything a man could ask for, but it wasn't enough! They stabbed us in the back for - for MONEY! [he slams a fist into the wall] We'll have to respond.}
{351}{}{什么？！但是-让我看看。[他拿着全息光盘，消失在办公室里，怒气冲冲地回来]那些人渣！那些叛徒！那些-那些-我不敢相信我们被这样背叛了！我们给了他们诚实的工作，地位，一个男人能要求的一切，但这还不够！他们为了钱在背后捅了我们一刀！[他用拳头猛击墙壁]我们必须做出回应。}
#{352}{}{What are you going to do?}
{352}{}{你打算怎么办？}
#{353}{}{That's internal business. Don't you worry about it. You... You've done a great service for the Nevada Express. We won't forget it. If you ever need us again, you can expect a substantial discount, as our thanks.}
{353}{}{那是内部事务。别担心。你...你为内华达快车做了很好的服务。我们不会忘记的。如果您再需要我们，我们会给您很大的折扣，谢谢。}
#{354}{}{Thanks. What do I tell the bikers?}
{354}{}{谢谢。我该怎么跟骑自行车的人说？}
#{355}{}{[He sighs] Please send them our apologies. I know it's not enough, but our reputation will suffer enough as it is when I tell my superiors about this. We can't afford anything more.}
{355}{}{请向他们致歉。我知道这还不够，但当我把这件事告诉我的上级时，我们的声誉就会受到影响。我们再也买不起了。}
#{356}{}{I see. Well, good luck.}
{356}{}{我懂了。好吧，祝你好运。}
#{357}{}{Your investigation has earned you a 20% discount on Nevada Express services.}
{357}{}{你的调查为你赢得了内华达快递20%的折扣。}
