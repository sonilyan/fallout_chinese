{1102}{}{我将不得不重新做每件事。。。}
### {103}{}{Great job... for a smooth-skinned person.}
{103}{}{干得好。。。对于皮肤光滑的人来说。}
### {104}{}{This is the engine room. I hope everything works here, otherwise the station won't be of any use.}
{104}{}{这是机舱。我希望这里一切正常，否则车站就没用了。}
### {105}{}{We're already close. Take me to the console in the control room.}
{105}{}{我们已经接近了。带我到控制室的控制台。}

### {200}{}{I never thought to see normie here. You must have an awl in your ass?}
{200}{}{我从没想过在这里见到诺米。你屁股上一定有锥子？}
### {201}{}{Brand new and straight into hell? That's what I understand! But be careful, it's very dangerous here.}
{201}{}{全新的，直接进入地狱？这就是我所理解的！但是要小心，这里很危险。}

{202}{}{古斯塔沃先生派我来。我能帮你什么？}
### {203}{}{And what are you doing here?}
{203}{}{你在这里干什么？}
### {204}{}{We are trying to do the impossible here ? to force the dam to give electricity. That's just from above it was captured by military robots during the nuclear war. They don't let anyone in.}
{204}{}{我们正在努力做不可能的事? 迫使大坝通电。从上面看，它是在核战争期间被军用机器人捕获的。他们不让任何人进来。}
### {205}{}{And where do you need to get to?}
{205}{}{你需要去哪里？}
### {206}{}{I need to get to the control center. It's somewhere underground. Try to find a safe way. Otherwise, I'm not ready to become a part of the local wonderful nature yet.}
{206}{}{我需要去控制中心。它在地下的某个地方。尽量找一条安全的路。否则，我还没有准备好成为当地美妙自然的一部分。}
### {207}{}{Good. But first I'll try to do it myself.}
{207}{}{好的但首先我会试着自己做。}
### {208}{}{Then come with me. I know how to bypass robots.}
{208}{}{那跟我来吧。我知道如何绕过机器人。}
### {209}{}{First tell me, what is this place?}
{209}{}{首先告诉我，这是什么地方？}
### {210}{}{This is the Bonita Dam. It was created to store water. The power plant was built here already in times of crisis, when there was a shortage of liquid fuel. Its power is barely enough for the needs of Glow. But there is no other surviving station in the city.}
{210}{}{这是博尼塔大坝。它是用来蓄水的。这座发电厂是在危机时期建造的，当时液体燃料短缺。它的能量几乎不足以满足Glow的需要。但是这个城市没有其他幸存的车站。}
### {211}{}{I need to get to the control center. It seems we are on the right track.}
{211}{}{我需要去控制中心。看来我们走在了正确的轨道上。}
### {212}{}{This is the control center. It seems that there has not been a cleaning done for a long time. Nothing, we are not used to... And this, apparently, is the control panel? Wait a minute... so... Done. Hmm. The station is mothballed. I'll have to work with the handles.}
{212}{}{这是控制中心。好像很久没有打扫了。没什么，我们不习惯……这显然是控制面板吗？等一下。。。所以…完成了。嗯，车站被封存了。我得处理把手。}
### {213}{}{What should I do?}
{213}{}{我该怎么办？}
### {214}{}{We need to start the second turbine in the engine room. It may take a lot of effort there.}
{214}{}{我们需要启动机舱里的第二台涡轮机。这可能需要付出很多努力。}
### {215}{}{Clear.}
{215}{}{清楚的}
### {216}{}{This is the engine room. But now we need to get to the control center.}
{216}{}{这是机舱。但现在我们需要到达控制中心。}
### {217}{}{Wait here.}
{217}{}{在这里等候。}
### {218}{}{Follow me.}
{218}{}{跟我来。}

### {220}{}{This dam will remain a pathetic piece of concrete until we make it work for the benefit of the Glow.}
{220}{}{这座大坝将一直是一块可怜的混凝土，直到我们让它为Glow的利益而工作。}
### {221}{}{Don't tell me you're lost here.}
{221}{}{别告诉我你在这里迷路了。}
### {1221}{}{Don't tell me you're lost here.}
{1221}{}{别告诉我你在这里迷路了。}
### {222}{}{Wait a bit. I'll be back soon.}
{222}{}{等一下。我很快就会回来。}
### {223}{}{What should I do now?}
{223}{}{我现在该怎么办？}
### {224}{}{The second turbine is spinning.}
{224}{}{第二台涡轮机正在旋转。}
### {225}{}{Hmm, if the turbine is working, then why is there no current coming from it? There must be a gap in the power grid. Check carefully the entire chain from the turbine to the switch.}
{225}{}{嗯，如果涡轮机在工作，那么为什么没有电流从它出来呢？电网一定有缺口。仔细检查从涡轮机到开关的整个链条。}
### {226}{}{You're kidding...}
{226}{}{你在开玩笑。。。}
### {227}{}{OK.}
{227}{}{好啊}
### {228}{}{It seems that there is no gap in the network now.}
{228}{}{现在网络上似乎没有缺口了。}
### {229}{}{Really... Now I will supply current to the substation... Damn it, the substation is not responding. Probably, it was also preserved. You'll have to go there and run it. Remember: we need to direct energy strictly to the power lines in San Isidro and the Old Town. The remaining circuits need to be disconnected.}
{229}{}{真正地现在我将为变电站供电。。。该死，变电站没有反应。也许，它也被保存了下来。你必须去那里运行它。记住：我们需要严格将能源输送到圣伊西德罗和老城区的电力线上。需要断开其余电路。}
### {230}{}{Yes!}
{230}{}{对}
### {231}{}{It seems like I'm doing all the work here...}
{231}{}{我好像在这里做所有的工作。。。}
### {232}{}{Bonita! Do you hear this wonderful crackling in the transformers and the hum in the wires? It's been a long time since I've heard anything like this. Thank you, amigo. I hope Gustavo will reward you well. Here, take a Geiger counter. You'll need it on your way to San Ysidro.}
{232}{}{博尼塔！你听到变压器发出美妙的噼啪声和电线发出的嗡嗡声了吗？我已经很久没有听到这样的消息了。谢谢你，朋友。我希望古斯塔沃会好好报答你。给，拿个盖革计数器。你在去圣伊西德罗的路上需要它。}
### {233}{}{Bye, Isaac.}
{233}{}{再见，艾萨克。}
### {234}{}{But impassable ruins stretch between the power plant and residential areas...}
{234}{}{但无法通行的废墟在发电厂和居民区之间延伸。。。}
### {235}{}{You're thinking! Even though you're not from our century. Although we are ghouls, we have already launched several working robots and prepared power lines. You don't need much for this.}
{235}{}{你在想！尽管你不是我们这个世纪的人。尽管我们是食尸鬼，但我们已经推出了几个工作机器人，并准备好了电源线。你不需要太多。}
