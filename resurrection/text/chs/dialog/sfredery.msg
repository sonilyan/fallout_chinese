{300}{}{对不起，我得为那个会议做准备。}
#{350}{}{I don't want to hurt you. Please, don't make me do it.}
{350}{}{我不想伤害你。拜托，别逼我这么做。}

{554}{}{有没有人在贵公司订过私人大篷车？}
#{555}{}{I actually have to go. Goodbye.}
{555}{}{我得走了。再见。}
#{600}{}{Oh yes, definitely. You can get a job with the caravan guards, I can use every spare hand, just come on the 9th or the 23rd day of the month. I pay 400 caps for one trip. Also, I'm currently looking for someone to do a couple of things for me here in Sedit.}
{600}{}{哦，是的，当然。你可以在商队警卫那里找到一份工作，我可以动用所有的人手，就在这个月的9号或23号来。一次旅行我付400英镑。此外，我目前正在寻找一个人做一些事情，为我在赛迪特这里。}
#{601}{}{I'm interested in the job with the caravans.}
{601}{}{我对商队的工作很感兴趣。}

#{702}{}{Byee-byee.}
{702}{}{再见再见。}

#{753}{}{I've got to go, see you.}
{753}{}{我得走了，再见。}
#{800}{}{Sedit is a town of caravans and commerce. People from all over the wasteland come here to do business with practically everything that can cross your mind. And if there's something missing, the next caravans can deliver it. That's how the whole town works.}
{800}{}{塞迪特是一个商队和商业聚集的小镇。来自荒原各地的人们来这里做生意，几乎所有你能想到的东西。如果有什么东西不见了，下一批商队可以送过去。整个镇子就是这样运作的。}
#{801}{}{Would you answer me another question?}
{801}{}{你能再回答我一个问题吗？}
#{802}{}{I've got to go, see you.}
{802}{}{我得走了，再见。}
#{850}{}{No, definitely not. I don't run private caravan business. In my company, the merchandise is either transported publicly or not at all. I'm not interested in any kind of criminal activity.}
{850}{}{不，绝对不是。我不经营私人房车生意。在我公司，商品要么公开运输，要么根本不运输。我对任何犯罪活动都不感兴趣。}
#{851}{}{I understand. Would you answer me another question?}
{851}{}{我理解。你能再回答我一个问题吗？}
#{852}{}{I see, I was just wondering. Goodbye.}
{852}{}{我明白了，我只是想知道。再见。}
#{900}{}{You're lucky, the caravans are leaving today. Do you want to go to Corath or Albuquerque? Both routes are for 400 caps.}
{900}{}{你真幸运，商队今天就要出发了。你想去科拉斯还是阿尔伯克基？两条路线都是400个帽。}
#{901}{}{Corath.}
{901}{}{科拉斯。}
#{902}{}{Albuquerque.}
{902}{}{阿尔伯克基。}
#{903}{}{Nowhere, actually. Goodbye.}
{903}{}{实际上，哪儿也没有。再见。}

#{966}{}{Oh well...}
{966}{}{哦，好吧。。。}
#{1000}{}{You've come just in time. You know, I was invited by Sedit Caravan to a private meeting in the official room, apparently because of some issues from the last meeting that haven't been dealt with. It seems suspicious to me. I don't have a particularly good relationship with the management of said company. So instead of going myself, I'd like to send someone able to handle... more demanding situations. Do you feel up to it? I'd pay you well, afterwards.}
{1000}{}{你来得正是时候。你知道，我是受赛迪特商队的邀请去参加一个在正式会议室举行的私人会议的，显然是因为上次会议的一些问题没有得到处理。我觉得很可疑。我和上述公司的管理层关系不是特别好。所以我不想自己去，我想派一个能处理。。。要求更高的情况。你能胜任吗？以后我会给你丰厚的报酬。}

{1001}{}{你来得正是时候。你看，我被塞迪特车队邀请到一个私人会议在正式会议室，显然是因为一些问题，从上一次会议尚未处理。我觉得很可疑。我和上述公司的管理层关系不是特别好。所以我不想自己去，我想派一个能处理。。。要求更高的情况。你能胜任吗？以后我会给你丰厚的报酬。}
#{1002}{}{I sure do, I'll go there right away. There's no sense putting it off.}
{1002}{}{当然，我马上就去。拖延是没有意义的。}
#{1003}{}{Yeah, I agree, something's not right there. The best thing'll be to ask directly at Sedit Caravan.}
{1003}{}{是的，我同意，有些不对劲。最好是直接到赛迪特商队问问。}
#{1004}{}{No. Get someone else for the job.}
{1004}{}{不，找其他人来做这个工作。}
#{1050}{}{I see, I expected they might want to leave. The locals have been treating them bad recently. Yes, they can join one of my caravans. Tell them to come see me as soon as possible so we can discuss the details.}
{1050}{}{我知道了，我以为他们会离开。当地人最近对他们很不好。是的，他们可以加入我的车队。告诉他们尽快来看我，这样我们就可以讨论细节了。}
#{1051}{}{Thank you. I'll send them right away.}
{1051}{}{非常感谢。我马上送过去。}
#{1100}{}{You're not well? Wait, I've got something here... Perhaps it'll help. [He hands you a stimpak.] I hope you know how it's used?}
{1100}{}{你不舒服？等等，我这里有东西。。。也许会有帮助。[他递给你一个兴奋剂]我希望你知道它是怎么用的？}
#{1101}{}{Thankee! Why you here?}
{1101}{}{谢谢！你为什么在这里？}
#{1102}{}{Me usah rightee-oh!}
{1102}{}{我很好哦！}
#{1150}{}{Thank you, you're doing me a big favor. The meeting's tonight. Please, be careful.}
{1150}{}{谢谢，你帮了我一个大忙。今晚开会。拜托，小心点。}
#{1151}{}{Don't worry. I can take care of myself.}
{1151}{}{别担心。我能照顾好自己。}
#{1200}{}{OK, do as you see fit. Sedit Caravan are located on the Main Street. I'll wait here until you get back.}
{1200}{}{好吧，随你怎么办。塞迪特商队位于主街。我在这儿等你回来。}
#{1201}{}{Good.}
{1201}{}{很好。}
#{1250}{}{In that case, I'll go there myself.}
{1250}{}{那样的话，我自己去。}
#{1251}{}{Fine.}
{1251}{}{好的。}
#{1300}{}{I think I've already said that. I run this caravan company.}

#{1301}{}{Caravan?! Whee, huh, want!}
{1301}{}{大篷车？！哦，哈，想要！}
#{1302}{}{Bye-bye.}
{1302}{}{再见。}
#{1350}{}{So what did they tell you at Sedit Caravan?}
{1350}{}{那他们在赛迪特商队跟你说了什么？}
#{1351}{}{Nothing that'd convince me. I still have doubts. I'd better go to that meeting instead of you.}
{1351}{}{没什么能说服我的。我仍然有疑虑。我最好去参加那个会议而不是你。}
#{1352}{}{You've got nothing to worry about. It's just a regular meeting.}
{1352}{}{你没什么好担心的。只是例会而已。}
#{1353}{}{Nothing, yet.}
{1353}{}{还没有。}
#{1354}{}{Uf.}
{1354}{}{佛罗里达州。}
#{1355}{}{I haven't been there. I figured there's no point complicating things. I'll go to the meeting instead of you, as you wanted me to.}
{1355}{}{我没去过那里。我觉得把事情复杂化是没有意义的。我将代替你去开会，正如你所希望的那样。}
#{1356}{}{I haven't been there. I figured there's no point complicating things. I'll go to the meeting instead of you, as you wanted me to.}
{1356}{}{我没去过那里。我觉得把事情复杂化是没有意义的。我将代替你去开会，正如你所希望的那样。}
#{1400}{}{OK, I'll go there myself, then. I guess I've been too suspicious for nothing.}
{1400}{}{好吧，那我自己去。我想我太多疑了。}
#{1401}{}{Yeah, probably.}
{1401}{}{是的，可能吧。}
#{1450}{}{So tell me, what was it like? What happened?}
{1450}{}{告诉我，那是什么感觉？怎么搞的？}
#{1451}{}{There was a woman, dressed in black, and as soon as I walked in, she set her men on me. She certainly wanted to kill you. She was quite disappointed I was there instead of you. I managed to take care of myself, as you can see, but she escaped.}
{1451}{}{有一个女人，穿着黑色衣服，我一走进来，她就把她的人放在我身上。她当然想杀了你。她很失望我代替你去了。你看，我设法照顾好自己，但她逃跑了。}

#{1454}{}{Nicol was there, but as soon as I walked in, she set her men on me. She certainly wanted to kill you. She was quite disappointed I was there instead of you. I managed to take care of myself, as you can see, but she escaped.}

{1455}{}{尼科尔在那里，但我一走进来，她就把她的人放在我身上。她当然想杀了你。她很失望我代替你去了。你看，我设法照顾好自己，但她逃跑了。}
#{1500}{}{That was Nicol, the owner of Sedit Caravan. I was afraid she'd try something like this. There's quite a bit of competition between our companies.}
{1500}{}{那是尼科尔，塞迪特商队的老板。我怕她会这样做。我们公司之间的竞争相当激烈。}
#{1501}{}{What are you going to do now?}
{1501}{}{你现在要做什么？}
#{1502}{}{Interesting. Now I want my reward.}
{1502}{}{很有趣。现在我要我的报酬。}
#{1503}{}{Nicol, the owner of Sedit Caravan? I was afraid she'd try something like this. There's quite a bit of competition between our companies.}
{1503}{}{尼科尔，塞迪特商队的老板？我怕她会这样做。我们公司之间的竞争相当激烈。}
#{1550}{}{I can't do anything. It's just your word against hers, a stranger's word against the word of the owner of a caravan company. On top of that, she's also a member of the Town Council. We must let it be. Here, take your reward and try to forget this whole terrible affair as soon as you can.}
{1550}{}{我什么都做不了。只是你对她的话，陌生人对商队老板的话。除此之外，她还是市议会的成员。我们必须顺其自然。拿着你的奖赏，尽快忘掉这件可怕的事情。}

#{1552}{}{If you say so.}
{1552}{}{如果你这样说。}
#{1600}{}{Sure, here, it's yours. This is actually the only thing I can do at the moment. To confront Nicol would be suicide.}
{1600}{}{当然，给你。这实际上是我目前唯一能做的事。和尼科尔对质就是自杀。}
#{1601}{}{If you say so.}
{1601}{}{如果你这样说。}
#{1650}{}{You know, my company has another problem, an even bigger one. It's the raiders. My caravans've been facing more and more attacks. You've shown you can handle things when in danger, so I was thinking you might want to help me with them.}
{1650}{}{你知道，我的公司还有一个问题，一个更大的问题。是袭击者。我的商队正面临越来越多的袭击。你已经证明了你在危险的时候可以处理事情，所以我想你可能会想帮我。}

{1653}{}{如果钱够的话，我就是你的人。}
#{1654}{}{I don't want to have anything to do with it. Good-bye.}
{1654}{}{我不想和它有任何关系。再见。}
#{1700}{}{Fine. But you have to know it's all more complicated than it may seem at first glance. [He sighs.] The raiders are attacking every important caravan sent out of town. Because they can't watch the whole wasteland, they must have information from someone inside. Someone from my company who knows all about our caravan routes and when the caravans transport really valuable goods. That narrows it down to three people apart from me: Frost, our caravan leader; my deputy Tim; and our assistant Jeremy. Maybe I'm wrong, but I can't take the risk. I want you to take a closer look at those three. Try inviting them for a drink in the pub and when they're in the mood, talk to them. The culprit will perhaps give himself away on his own.}
{1700}{}{好的。但你必须知道这比乍一看要复杂得多。[他叹了口气]袭击者正在袭击每一辆派往城外的重要商队。因为他们看不到整个荒地，他们必须从里面的人那里得到信息。我公司的人知道我们商队的路线，知道商队什么时候运送贵重物品。这就把范围缩小到除了我以外的三个人：弗罗斯特，我们的车队队长，我的副手蒂姆，还有我们的助手杰里米。也许我错了，但我不能冒险。我要你仔细看看那三个。试着邀请他们去酒吧喝一杯，当他们心情好的时候，和他们谈谈。罪犯也许会自首。}

#{2152}{}{No hussle. But I'm not doing the other job. Good-bye.}
{2152}{}{别胡闹。但我不做其他的工作。再见。}
#{2200}{}{As I've already said. We must ensure that crook won't be able to endanger any more lives. You have to get him out of town somehow. There you'll tell him he may never return. But don't hurt him, no matter what. The exile will be sufficient punishment for him.}
{2200}{}{我已经说过了。我们必须确保克鲁克不会再危及生命。你得设法把他弄出去。在那里你会告诉他他可能再也不会回来了。但无论如何，不要伤害他。流放对他来说已经足够了。}
#{2201}{}{You don't have to worry about it. I'll take care of him.}
{2201}{}{你不用担心。我会照顾他的。}
#{2202}{}{I'm sorry, I just can't do that. Good-bye.}
{2202}{}{对不起，我不能那样做。再见。}
#{2250}{}{Thank you, I couldn't have done it on my own. [He gives you }
{2250}{}{谢谢，我不可能一个人做的。[他给了你}
#{2253}{}{ caps.] You deserve the money. And...  I've got another job for you.}
{2253}{}{你应该得到这笔钱。还有。。。我有另一份工作给你。}
#{2251}{}{I'm listening.}
{2251}{}{我在听。}
#{2252}{}{I'm not interested in another job. See you, Frederyk.}
{2252}{}{我对另一份工作不感兴趣。再见，弗雷德里克。}
#{2300}{}{Good. At the time of your absence, I managed to find out where the raiders've set up their main hideout. Those cutthroats are right here in Sedit, more precisely in Lost Town. That's how they are able to attack my caravans right outside the town. Rumor is they're hiding somewhere underground, but I didn't find out how to get to them.}
{2300}{}{很好。你不在的时候，我设法找到了袭击者的主要藏身处。那些杀手就在塞迪特，更确切地说是在失落的小镇。他们就是这样在城外袭击我的商队的。传闻说他们藏在地下，但我不知道怎么找到他们。}
#{2301}{}{What do you want me to do?}
{2301}{}{你要我做什么？}
#{2350}{}{You have to find their hideout. [He sighs.]. And kill all of them. I'm afraid there is no other way to prevent further attacks on the caravans.}
{2350}{}{你必须找到他们的藏身处。[他叹了口气。]。把他们都杀了。恐怕没有别的办法阻止商队遭到进一步袭击。}
#{2351}{}{I'll take care of them. Nobody will survive.}
{2351}{}{我会照顾他们的。没人能活下来。}
#{2352}{}{I'm not risking my skin. Forget it.}
{2352}{}{我没有拿我的皮肤冒险。算了吧。}
#{2353}{}{What's the pay for the job?}
{2353}{}{这份工作的报酬是多少？}
#{2354}{}{It's your lucky day. I've already stumbled upon that hideout and killed all the raiders.}
{2354}{}{今天是你的幸运日。我已经无意中发现了那个藏身处，杀死了所有的袭击者。}
#{2355}{}{It's your lucky day. I've already stumbled upon that hideout and killed all the raiders.}
{2355}{}{今天是你的幸运日。我已经无意中发现了那个藏身处，杀死了所有的袭击者。}
#{2400}{}{I know it's a challenging task but I can't offer you more than }
{2400}{}{我知道这是一项很有挑战性的任务，但我不能给你更多}
#{2401}{}{ caps. That's all I can spare right now.}
{2401}{}{瓶盖。这就是我现在所能节省的。}
#{2402}{}{Fine, I'll deal with the raiders. Nobody will survive.}
{2402}{}{好吧，我来对付袭击者。没人能活下来。}
#{2403}{}{That's not enough. See you, Frederyk.}
{2403}{}{这还不够。再见，弗雷德里克。}
#{2404}{}{It's your lucky day. I've already stumbled upon the raiders and I killed them all.}
{2404}{}{今天是你的幸运日。我已经发现了袭击者，我把他们都杀了。}
#{2405}{}{It's your lucky day. I've already stumbled upon the raiders and killed them all.}
{2405}{}{今天是你的幸运日。我已经偶然发现了袭击者，把他们都杀了。}
#{2450}{}{Thank you. Those raiders nearly took my company out of business. Without their raids, the situation may finally improve. Here, take your reward. [He hands you }
{2450}{}{非常感谢。那些袭击者差点让我的公司倒闭。如果没有他们的突袭，情况可能最终会好转。来，拿你的奖赏。[他递给你]}
#{2454}{}{ caps.] And I've got another offer for you. To offset my losses, I've decided to send a big caravan to Albuquerque. Now that the raider problem's been resolved for good, an enterprise like that has a chance to succeed. How would you like to join with us? All guards'll get paid double.}
{2454}{}{我还有另一个报价给你。为了弥补我的损失，我决定派一辆大篷车去阿尔伯克基。现在突袭者的问题已经解决了，这样的企业有机会成功。你愿意和我们一起去吗？所有警卫都会得到双倍的报酬。}
#{2451}{}{Count me in. I can go right now.}
{2451}{}{把我算进去。我现在可以走了。}
#{2452}{}{You can forget about that. Your caravan will have to make it without me.}
{2452}{}{你可以忘了那件事。你的大篷车不用我也能走。}
#{2453}{}{I'm not against the idea, but you'll have to wait for a while. I've got a few things in Sedit I have to settle first.}
{2453}{}{我不反对这个主意，但你得等一会儿。我有几件事要先解决。}
#{2500}{}{I can delay the caravan's departure by one day, but not more. Will that be enough?}
{2500}{}{我可以把商队的出发时间推迟一天，但不能再推迟了。够了吗？}
#{2501}{}{I'm sure it will. Thanks.}
{2501}{}{我肯定会的。谢谢。}
#{2550}{}{You're here, great. The caravan's ready to depart.}
{2550}{}{你来了，太好了。商队准备出发了。}
#{2551}{}{We can set out, then.}
{2551}{}{我们可以出发了。}
#{2552}{}{Is it possible for other passengers to join a caravan?}
{2552}{}{其他乘客有可能加入商队吗？}
#{2553}{}{Change of plan. Your caravan will have to make it without me.}
{2553}{}{改变计划。你的大篷车不用我也能走。}
#{2554}{}{Hang on a second.}
{2554}{}{等一下。}
#{2555}{}{Uff.}
{2555}{}{不明飞行物。}
#{2600}{}{Definitely not this one. There's too many people in it as it is. I don't want it to attract unnecessary attention in the wastes. But I'm sure we could think of something some other time. Who are they?}
{2600}{}{绝对不是这个。现在人太多了。我不想它在垃圾堆里引起不必要的注意。但我相信我们可以另找时间想点什么。他们是谁？}
#{2601}{}{The ghouls from Falcon's Flight.}
{2601}{}{猎鹰飞行中的僵尸。}
#{2602}{}{No one, actually. Goodbye.}
{2602}{}{实际上，没有人。再见。}
#{2650}{}{The goods from the big caravan were sold in Albuquerque with a large profit. My company thrives once again. You can't imagine how grateful I am for that. What can I do for you?}
{2650}{}{大篷车上的货物在阿尔伯克基出售，获利颇丰。我的公司又兴旺起来了。你无法想象我对此有多感激。有什么事吗？}
#{2651}{}{You could answer a few questions.}
{2651}{}{你可以回答几个问题。}
#{2652}{}{I want to get hired as a caravan guard.}
{2652}{}{我想当一名商队警卫。}
#{2653}{}{Is it possible for other passengers to join a caravan?}
{2653}{}{其他乘客有可能加入商队吗？}
#{2654}{}{Nothing at all. Goodbye, Frederyk.}
{2654}{}{什么都没有。再见，弗雷德里克。}
#{2655}{}{Wanna go caravanin'!}
{2655}{}{想去旅行！}
#{2656}{}{Nuffin', bah! Make bye-bye.}
{2656}{}{努芬，呸！再见。}
#{2700}{}{I'm sorry but the caravan had to leave. I couldn't delay the departure any longer.}
{2700}{}{很抱歉，车队不得不离开。我不能再推迟出发了。}
#{2701}{}{I'm sorry but the caravan had to leave. I couldn't delay the departure any longer.}
{2701}{}{很抱歉，车队不得不离开。我不能再推迟出发了。}
#{2702}{}{I'm sorry to hear that.}
{2702}{}{听到这个消息我很难过。}
#{2703}{}{Boo-hoo.}
{2703}{}{呜呜。}
#{2750}{}{Have you heard? The big caravan to Albuquerque was ambushed right outside Sedit by the raiders. All the guards were killed, the goods stolen. I don't understand how they just appeared there. I guess I'll never be free of those cutthroats. At least until I go out of business for good.}
{2750}{}{你听说了吗？开往阿尔伯克基的大篷车就在塞迪特城外遭到袭击者的伏击。所有的警卫都被杀了，货物被偷了。我不明白他们怎么会出现在那里。我想我永远也摆脱不了那些杀手。至少在我永远停业之前。}
#{2751}{}{Eh... Tough luck. I'll just leave you alone.}
{2751}{}{呃。。。真倒霉。我就让你一个人呆着。}
#{2752}{}{Egh-eh.}
{2752}{}{呃。}
#{2800}{}{I've heard what you've done. Leaving the caravan in the middle of the desert is a big transgression. How could you do that? You've endangered the goods and the other guards. It's a good thing they made the rest of the route without you. [He sighs.] I'll let it be this time but this must never happen again.}
{2800}{}{我听说你做了什么。把大篷车留在沙漠中央是一种严重的违法行为。你怎么能这么做？你危及了货物和其他守卫。幸好他们没带你走完剩下的路。[他叹了口气]这次我就让它过去吧，但这种事决不能再发生了。}

#{2850}{}{You're alive? I thought all the guards in the caravan to Albuquerque perished. Damn those raiders! I don't understand how they just appeared there. I guess I'll never be free of those cutthroats. At least until I go out of business for good.}

{2853}{}{呃。}
#{2900}{}{My company's caravans leave on the 9th and 23rd day of every month. If anyone comes at that time, they can join the caravan as guards. Our caravans travel to Albuquerque and Corath. Unfortunately, we only pay 200 caps. My company can't afford more right now.}
{2900}{}{我公司的商队每个月9号和23号出发。如果当时有人来，他们可以加入商队当警卫。我们的商队前往阿尔伯克基和科拉斯。不幸的是，我们只付200英镑。我的公司现在负担不起更多了。}
