#{100}{}{You see the butcher.}
{100}{}{你看到屠夫了。}
#{101}{}{You see a very strong man. He looks like he was born to a butcher.}
{101}{}{你看到一个非常强壮的人。他看起来像是个屠夫生的。}
#{102}{}{Mr. Luciano's dead. Dead, you hear that?! How are we going to run this place ourselves?}
{102}{}{卢西亚诺先生死了。死了，你听到了吗？！我们自己怎么管理这个地方？}
#{103}{}{You earn 100 experience points for learning about Mr. Luciano and his ranch.}
{103}{}{学习卢西亚诺先生和他的农场，您将获得100个经验点。}
#{110}{}{[You see a bald man with thick, strong arms. He tries to light his cigarette with the campfire and swears when he burns his fingers.]}
{110}{}{[你看到一个秃顶的男人，胳膊又粗又壮。他试着用篝火点燃香烟，烧伤手指时骂道}
#{111}{}{Heh, you could have guessed that would happen.}
{111}{}{嘿，你应该猜到了。}
#{112}{}{Hey, take this lighter. It's a gift.}
{112}{}{嘿，拿着这个打火机。这是一份礼物。}
#{113}{}{[Keep walking.]}
{113}{}{[继续走。]}
#{114}{}{One more word, and you'll be lighting my cigarettes for life.}
{114}{}{再多说一句，你就要为我点燃一辈子的香烟了。}
#{115}{}{Geez, sorry...}
{115}{}{天啊，对不起...}
#{116}{}{[He deliberates for a moment, but decides to take your gift] Thanks. You're new around here, right?}
{116}{}{[他考虑了一会儿，但决定收下你的礼物]谢谢。你是新来的，对吧？}
#{117}{}{Uh, yes. I wanted to see the ranch from the inside.}
{117}{}{嗯，是的。我想从里面看看牧场。}
#{118}{}{Yeah, I get that. It's pretty impressive, ain't it?}
{118}{}{是的，我明白了。很令人印象深刻，不是吗？}
#{119}{}{Can I ask you some questions about the ranch?}
{119}{}{我能问你一些关于牧场的问题吗？}
#{120}{}{That it is. I'm going to keep looking around.}
{120}{}{是的。我要继续四处看看。}
#{121}{}{Go ahead. Maybe I can tell you something.}
{121}{}{前进。也许我可以告诉你一些事情。}
#{122}{}{Tell me about this ranch.}
{122}{}{告诉我这个牧场的情况。}
#{123}{}{What can I say? It's not just our job, it's our home. We're family here. No one leaves from family ties... Mr. Luciano sees that as betrayal, and, heh, you don't want him mad at you. Now that you'd want to, anyway. Reno's never gonna stop needing food, and we've got plenty of it. Things are even better now that we're using slaves to harvest crops. Whatever we can't use, we feed to the brahmin, until they're good to slaughter. It always takes the newbies some time to get used to things, but for us it's just ordinary.}
{123}{}{我能说什么？这不仅是我们的工作，也是我们的家。我们是一家人。没有人离开家庭关系...卢西亚诺先生认为这是背叛，而且，嘿，你不想让他生你的气。既然你愿意，无论如何。雷诺永远不会停止需要食物，我们有很多。现在情况更好了，我们用奴隶收割庄稼。不管我们用不了什么，我们都会喂双头牛，直到他们被屠杀。新手总是需要一些时间来适应事物，但对我们来说这只是普通的事情。}
#{124}{}{So you make food for the entire city?}
{124}{}{所以你为整个城市做食物？}
#{125}{}{No, of course not. There's other farmers around Reno, and they say there's a tribe of Indians to the north-east that grows good harvest. But Mr. Luciano's definitely the biggest producer around here. He's reliable and honest, and his ranch is the biggest around.}
{125}{}{不，当然不是。里诺周围还有其他农民，他们说东北部有一个印第安人部落种植丰收。但卢西亚诺先生绝对是这里最大的制片人。他可靠诚实，他的农场是世界上最大的。}
#{126}{}{How is it possible to run such a large ranch?}
{126}{}{怎么可能经营这么大的牧场？}
#{127}{}{It ain't easy. The land still remembers what humanity did to it sixty tears ago. Even today we've got to deal with sick animals and crop failures. They say the first twenty years after the war, there were no crops at all, but I wouldn't know. Mr. Luciano's the only one who's been here since those times. They say he and his wife Marin worked this land since before the bombs fell. I don't know how much of that is true, but I'll tell you this - no one knows the farming business like Mr. Luciano. He was one of the first to use water exclusively from wells rather than open sources. He was one of the first to use slaves, too, instead of hired hands. The man's will is unbreakable. He never gave up on this ranch, even after his wife passed away.}
{127}{}{这不容易。这片土地仍然记得六十年前人类对它所做的一切。即使在今天，我们也要对付生病的动物和农作物歉收。他们说战后的头二十年，根本没有收成，但我不知道。卢西亚诺先生是唯一一个从那时起来这里的人。他们说他和他的妻子马林在炸弹落下之前就在这片土地上工作。我不知道有多少是真的，但我要告诉你，没有人像卢西亚诺先生那样了解农业。他是第一个完全使用井水而不是开放水源的人。他也是最早使用奴隶代替雇工的人之一。这个人的意志是牢不可破的。他从未放弃过这个牧场，即使在他妻子去世之后。}
#{128}{}{What can you tell me about Mr. Luciano?}
{128}{}{关于卢西亚诺先生，你能告诉我什么？}
#{129}{}{He's the head of the ranch. And I don't just mean he pays us, I mean he's the one that gives life to this place. He's old now, of course, but he's still a man to be respected. He's still standing, even after everything.}
{129}{}{他是牧场主。我不只是说他付钱给我们，我是说他给了这个地方生命。当然，他现在老了，但他仍然是一个值得尊敬的人。他仍然站着，即使一切都结束了。}
#{130}{}{"Even after everything"? What do you mean?}
{130}{}{“即使在一切之后”？什么意思？}
#{131}{}{He lived for his family, but everyone from his family is gone. He's the last Luciano.}
{131}{}{他为家人而活，但家里的人都走了。他是最后一个卢西亚诺。}
#{132}{}{Tell me his story.}
{132}{}{告诉我他的故事。}
#{133}{}{Tell me Mr. Luciano's story.}
{133}{}{告诉我卢西亚诺先生的故事。}
#{134}{}{I don't know much I'm allowed to tell you, but I'll give you what I think is important. He was one of five children in a poor family. A lot of his family died soon after the bombs - some from street fighting, some from radiation, some just from hunger. Mr. Luciano was only about ten at the time, but he remembers those times. He swore he'd rise above that life. He knew he was made for something more.}
{134}{}{我不知道我可以告诉你多少，但我会告诉你我认为重要的事情。他是一个贫困家庭五个孩子中的一个。他的很多家人在炸弹爆炸后不久就死了――一些死于街头战斗，一些死于核辐射，一些死于饥饿。卢西亚诺当时只有10岁左右，但他还记得那些日子。他发誓要超越那种生活。他知道他是天生的。}
#{135}{}{[Next]}
{135}{}{[下一步]}
#{136}{}{He worked hard all his life. It's amazing he's alive now - he's had heart attacks, hemorrhoids, hell, he's even going blind - but he's got spirit like fire, even after losing all his family. His wife died of cancer about two years ago, rest her soul. His first son died in childbirth. Doctors said that was due to the radiation he and his wife picked up from the soil when they worked the soil. His second son was about twenty when he died mysteriously during the war between businesses a decade back. No one ever found the murderer.}
{136}{}{他一生都在努力工作。令人惊讶的是他现在还活着――他心脏病发作，痔疮，见鬼，他甚至失明了――但他精神如火，即使失去了所有的家人。他的妻子大约两年前死于癌症，安息吧。他的第一个儿子死于分娩。医生说，那是因为他和妻子在耕作土壤时从土壤中吸收了辐射。十年前，他的第二个儿子在企业间的战争中神秘死亡，当时他大约二十岁。没人找到凶手。}
#{137}{}{[Next]}
{137}{}{[下一步]}
#{138}{}{Not many people could keep going after all that. But look at this ranch - it's a goddamn miracle, is what it is! And Mr. Luciano made it happen. His food has given so much life to Reno. There's a lot of people that wouldn't be alive today if it weren't for him.}
{138}{}{没多少人能坚持下去。但看看这个牧场-这是个他妈的奇迹，就是这样！卢西亚诺先生促成了这一切。他的食物给了雷诺如此多的生命。如果不是他，很多人今天都活不了。}
#{139}{}{What a grim story. I can tell Luciano stops at nothing for his business. What do you know about his participation in the current war in Reno?}
{139}{}{多可怕的故事啊。我可以告诉卢西亚诺为了他的生意什么都不做。你对他参与里诺战争了解多少？}
#{140}{}{Is it war, really? It's just some gangsters from the wasteland trying to steal what we've built. It's disgusting that anyone in Reno takes their side. Mr. Luciano actually stands for something. He fights for his ranch, and that's more important than whatever struggle for power that is going on in the city. I don't know what he's up to, but if you ask me, we'd all be better off if those gangsters got out of the city and never came back.}
{140}{}{真的是战争吗？只是一些从荒地来的歹徒想偷我们建的东西。里诺的人都站在他们一边真恶心。卢西亚诺先生实际上代表了一些东西。他为自己的牧场而战，这比城市里正在进行的任何权力斗争都重要。我不知道他在干什么，但如果你问我，如果那些歹徒出城再也不回来，我们都会过得更好。}
#{141}{}{Well, thanks for the story. It's given me food for thought.}
{141}{}{好吧，谢谢你的故事。它给了我思考的食物。}
#{142}{}{Sure. Take care.}
{142}{}{当然。当心。}
#{143}{}{Take care.}
{143}{}{当心。}
