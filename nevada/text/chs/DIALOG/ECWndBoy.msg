#{100}{}{You see a young soldier.}
{100}{}{你看到一个年轻的士兵。}
#{101}{}{You see a rookie from the Wind of War. It is clear that he is not happy with this duties.}
{101}{}{你看到一个来自战争之风的菜鸟。很明显，他对这一职责不满意。}
#{110}{}{Not now! Danger from all sides!}
{110}{}{不是现在！四面八方都有危险！}
#{111}{}{It's dangerous! Don't move out of the cover!}
{111}{}{太危险了！别离开掩护！}
#{112}{}{Hey, you're not one of those raiders? If you can't help, don't bother!}
{112}{}{嘿，你不是袭击者吗？如果你帮不上忙，就别管了！}
#{113}{}{No time to explain, the enemies are everywhere!}
{113}{}{没时间解释，敌人到处都是！}
#{114}{}{Hey, you got a gun? Then shoot, for your life!}
{114}{}{嘿，你有枪吗？那就开枪吧，为了你的生命！}
#{120}{}{Phew... [breathing heavily, grabs his chest and sits on the ground leaning on his arms] Hey, you're lucky that I didn't took you for a raider, or you would lie down on the ground, like the others.}
{120}{}{呸...[喘着粗气，抓住他的胸口，靠在胳膊上坐在地上]嘿，你很幸运，我没有把你当成袭击者，否则你会像其他人一样躺在地上。}
#{121}{}{Yeah, sure. Anyway, what happened?}
{121}{}{是的，当然。不管怎样，发生了什么？}
#{122}{}{There were three of us, we patrolled the area, when the raiders attacked us from their cover. I was quick to fight back and run, but they continued to follow me. Hell, just a little more time and I would have been roasted hard.}
{122}{}{我们有三个人，我们在这个地区巡逻，这时袭击者从他们的掩护下袭击了我们。我很快就反击逃跑了，但他们继续跟着我。天哪，只要再多一点时间，我就会被烤得很硬。}
#{123}{}{Hmm. Show me your clip... Oh, I see.}
{123}{}{嗯。给我看看你的剪辑...哦，我明白了。}
#{124}{}{Damn, because I'm a rookie, I was given little ammunition. What were they thinking, dammit! And you? At least you could help!}
{124}{}{妈的，因为我是新手，我没什么弹药。他们在想什么，该死的！和你？至少你能帮上忙！}
#{125}{}{I have to save ammo, ha-ha.}
{125}{}{我得省下弹药，哈哈。}
#{126}{}{Sorry, it was difficult for me to understand what's going on.}
{126}{}{对不起，我很难理解发生了什么事。}
#{127}{}{Oh, really? Well then, don't be angry if someone *mistakenly* just kicks you up the ass from the Wind of War. And now I have to go join my brothers in arms and tell them the whole story. You go your own way, wanderer.}
{127}{}{哦，真的吗？好吧，如果有人误打误撞地把你从战争的风口浪尖上踢了起来，别生气。现在我要和我的兄弟们一起去告诉他们整个故事。你走你自己的路，流浪者。}
#{128}{}{Yeah.}
{128}{}{是 啊。}
#{129}{}{That so? Hmm. Sounds plausible. Anyway, now I should go join my brothers in arms in the Wind of War and tell them the whole story. You go your own way, wanderer.}
{129}{}{是这样吗？嗯。听起来有道理。不管怎样，现在我应该去和我的兄弟们一起在战争的风中战斗，告诉他们整个故事。你走你自己的路，流浪者。}
#{130}{}{Wait, can you show where the Wind of War is?}
{130}{}{等等，你能告诉我战风在哪里吗？}
#{131}{}{Take care.}
{131}{}{当心。}
#{132}{}{Open your map. Go along the road, then turn North then so and so. Here is the station, where caravans stop, this is just the place for visitors like you. Now I gotta go.}
{132}{}{打开地图。沿着这条路走，然后向北，然后某某。这是火车站，商队在此停留，这正是像你这样的游客的去处。现在我得走了。}
#{133}{}{Thanks.}
{133}{}{谢谢。}
#{134}{}{You got the exact coordinates of the Wind of War.}
{134}{}{你得到了战争之风的精确坐标。}
#{140}{}{Phew... [breathing heavily, grabs his chest and sits on the ground leaning on his arms] Thank you, wanderer, if not for you, I would be burning in hell.}
{140}{}{呸...[喘着粗气，抓住胸口，靠着胳膊坐在地上]谢谢你，流浪汉，如果不是你，我会在地狱里燃烧。}
#{141}{}{What happened?}
{141}{}{怎么搞的？}
#{142}{}{I see, your ammo is almost gone.}
{142}{}{我明白了，你的弹药快没了。}
#{143}{}{Damn, right, as a rookie I was given a very few rounds. What were they thinking, dammit! I was lucky to meet you along the way.}
{143}{}{他妈的，对，作为一个菜鸟，我有过几次机会。他们在想什么，该死的！我很幸运在路上遇到你。}
#{144}{}{Yeah...}
{144}{}{是 啊...}
#{145}{}{Look, I will get back to my brothers in arms in the Wind of War, I will tell them about your help. Surely they will appreciate it. But now I have to go. Thanks again.}
{145}{}{听着，我会在战争之风中回到我的战友那里，我会告诉他们你的帮助。他们一定会感激的。但现在我得走了。再次感谢。}
#{146}{}{Take care.}
{146}{}{当心。}
#{147}{}{Your help to the recruit increased your reputation in the Wind of War.}
