### {103}{}{I'm Darren and I'm guarding this bridge, nothing more. [Breaks into a beaming smile.] That's the best damn answer I've given in months. People just walk by, never say a thing. When they see someone with a gun, they immediately assume trouble and stay quiet. They just don't get it that I'm here to prevent that. So, what brings you here stranger?}
{103}{}{我是达伦，我守护着这座桥，没有别的。[突然露出灿烂的笑容。]这是我几个月来给出的最好的答案。人们只是路过，什么也不说。当他们看到有人拿着枪时，他们立刻承担了麻烦并保持沉默。他们只是不明白我来这里是为了防止这种情况发生。那么，是什么把你带到这里来的陌生人？ -- I'm Darren and I'm guarding this bridge, nothing more.

{105}{}{我顺道去买些补给品，也许是个过夜的地方。你的工作到底是什么？ -- I stopped by to get some supplies, maybe a place for the night. What exactly is your job?}
### {106}{}{I'm the sheriff's deputy. I've been working here for a few years now. This may seem boring at first but let me tell you something, it turned out to be unexpectedly profitable. You see, a town of this size attracts traders and travelers from hundreds of miles around. And where there are goods there are bandits following them, who then choose to camp in the surrounding woodland. Some of these groups bring serious firepower, but... [He smiles.]}
{106}{}{我是警长的副手。我已经在这里工作了几年了。这一开始可能看起来很无聊，但让我告诉你，它出乎意料地有利可图。你看，这样大的城镇吸引了数百英里外的商人和游客。在有货物的地方，有土匪跟着他们，然后他们选择在周围的林地露营。其中一些团体拥有强大的火力，但是。。。[他笑了。] -- I'm the sheriff's deputy. I've been working here for a few years now. This may seem boring at first but let me tell you something, it turned out to be unexpectedly profitable.

{107}{}{但是 -- But...?}
### {108}{}{We got the brains. We have several snipers, hidden somewhere, covering the area. After the dust settles, all we have to do is to get rid of the bodies and collect the good stuff... sell some of it to the military, the rest to traders, it pays well enough.}
{108}{}{我们有头脑。我们有几个狙击手，藏在某个地方，掩护着这个地区。尘埃落定后，我们所要做的就是清除尸体，收集好东西。。。把其中一部分卖给军方，剩下的卖给贸易商，这样就足够划算了。 -- We got the brains. We have several snipers, hidden somewhere, covering the area.

{113}{}{谢谢你提供的信息。 -- Thanks for the info.}
### {114}{}{Well, I'm limited to what I can carry which is mostly ammo but if I would come across an interesting piece, why not. It's not like someone is going to rise from the dead and ask for his weapon back. But if someone does, maybe we're already in luck as they can only use their teeth. [Laughs.] Either way, I stick with my rifle here.}
{114}{}{嗯，我只能携带弹药，但如果我能遇到一件有趣的东西，为什么不呢。这并不是说有人会从死里复活并要求归还他的武器。但如果有人这样做了，也许我们已经很幸运了，因为他们只能用牙齿。[笑]不管怎样，我都会把步枪留在这里。 -- Well, I'm limited to what I can carry which is mostly ammo but if I would come across an interesting piece, why not.

### {121}{}{I can't tell you much since I'm mostly on duty, either guarding the bridge or walking the perimeter further out. I rarely take a stroll through town.

[Laughs.]}
{121}{}{我不能告诉你太多，因为我大部分时间都在值班，要么守着桥，要么走得更远。我很少在城里散步。[他笑了笑。]不过你可以问警长，他在这方面比我更足智多谋。我相信他会很高兴和你聊一聊。。。每天都有十几个人。[大笑。] -- I can't tell you much since I'm mostly on duty, either guarding the bridge or walking the perimeter further out.

{124}{}{我想偷偷溜进他们的基地，好好看看那个军械库。 -- I was thinking about sneaking into their base and have a good look at that armory.}
### {125}{}{[Smiles.] Well, good luck with that. They don't allow civilians even near the place. You have to be either military or someone from the law enforcement. Anyway, [whispering] just between us, I don't like those guys too much but their money is as good as any other. You know, speaking of business, mine started to involve more risk as bandits became better armed and organized. So I wanted to ask for a favor, in return I can get you something you'll find useful... like an access card for that military base, interested?}
{125}{}{[微笑]好吧，祝你好运。他们甚至不允许平民靠近这个地方。你必须要么是军人，要么是执法部门的人。不管怎样，只是在我们之间窃窃私语，我不太喜欢那些家伙，但他们的钱和其他人一样好。你知道，说到商业，随着土匪武装和组织的加强，我的风险开始增加。所以我想请你帮个忙，作为回报，我可以给你一些你会觉得有用的东西。。。比如那个军事基地的出入卡，感兴趣吗？ -- [Smiles.] Well, good luck with that.

### {128}{}{Like I said, the threat to our society has increased. We manage to compensate our lack of manpower with better gear, but those things cost, and are quite rare these days. I thought you have a better chance of finding some of the stuff we need.

{128}{}{正如我所说，对我们社会的威胁已经增加。我们设法用更好的装备来弥补人力不足，但这些东西很贵，而且现在很少见。我以为你有更好的机会找到我们需要的东西。我的一个朋友建议我买金属盔甲，说它比这种皮革更好耐用，所以我想从它开始。通常我会让我的一位同事这样做，或者自己去，但现在离开我的岗位风险太大了。我可以指望你，对吧？ -- Like I said, the threat to our society has increased.
