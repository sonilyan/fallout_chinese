### {100}{}{You see Frank.}
{100}{}{你看到弗兰克了。}
### {101}{}{Here is a resident of the asylum. He looks pretty fresh and clean compared to any inhabitant of the wasteland.}
{101}{}{这是收容所的一位居民。与荒地上的任何居民相比，他看起来都很清新干净。}

### {200}{}{P-please don't hit us! We are peaceful people and do not want problems.}

### {1201}{}{Why are you afraid of me? I didn't do anything wrong.}

### {202}{}{Then stop bleating, it annoys me.}
{202}{}{那就别叫了，这让我很恼火。}
### {203}{}{So... aren't you a raider?}
{203}{}{那么…你不是袭击者吗？}
### {204}{}{No, I'm }

### {205}{}{. And who are you?}

### {207}{}{Why?}

{208}{}{这个旧避难所一碰就碎了。生命支持系统出现故障，发电机未满负荷工作。我们不知道如何解决它。}

### {210}{}{And are these your problems? Ugh!}
{210}{}{这些是你的问题吗？啊！}
### {211}{}{Besides, there are raiders waiting for us outside. Over the past few months, they have carried out a dozen raids to seize the Vault. So far, they are being held back by a large door, but with such problems, we ourselves will soon go outside so as not to suffocate. I'm afraid to imagine what they will do to us. They've already caught Fred and are probably torturing him.}
{211}{}{此外，外面还有袭击者在等我们。在过去的几个月里，他们进行了十几次突袭以夺取避难所。到目前为止，他们被一扇大门挡住了，但有了这样的问题，我们自己很快就会走出去，以免窒息。我不敢想象他们会对我们做什么。他们已经抓住了弗雷德，可能正在折磨他。}
### {212}{}{How can I help you?}
{212}{}{我能帮你什么？}
### {213}{}{Well, I'm just solving all sorts of problems. Not for nothing, of course.}
{213}{}{我只是在解决各种各样的问题。当然不是白来的。}

### {216}{}{And now stand and look at the work of a professional.}

### {235}{}{How to restore life support?}
{235}{}{如何恢复生命支持？}
### {236}{}{After starting the generator, just use the computer to turn on the life support system. Then all we'll have to do is fix the robo-eye so that it can patrol the Vault and protect us from enemies.}
{236}{}{启动发电机后，只需使用计算机打开生命支持系统。然后我们要做的就是修复机器人眼，这样它就可以在避难所巡逻，保护我们免受敌人的攻击。}
### {237}{}{Tell me about this Vault.}
{237}{}{告诉我这个保险库的情况。}
### {238}{}{The Vault was built a hundred years ago. Our ancestors survived the nuclear war here. But it is no longer possible to fully survive in the Vault. We lock ourselves in here only when there is some kind of threat.}
{238}{}{避难所建于一百年前。我们的祖先在这里的核战争中幸存下来。但是，在保险库中完全生存已经不可能了。只有当存在某种威胁时，我们才会把自己锁在这里。}

{244}{}{我们没有太多有用的东西。给，穿上这件连身裤。他有点受伤，但仍然能很好地应对自然力的影响。}
### {245}{}{We don't have many useful things. Here, take this camping flask. The caretaker said that she brought him good luck when he traveled through the desert. With her, he never ran out of water, even in the hottest and driest places.}
{245}{}{我们没有太多有用的东西。拿着这个野营烧瓶。管理员说，当他穿越沙漠时，她给他带来了好运。和她在一起，即使在最热、最干燥的地方，他也从不缺水。}
