{119}{}{现在你将看到当你背叛社区时会发生什么！}
#{120}{}{Not now, outsider. We'll talk after we deal with this - [spits in disgust] - piece of shit.}

#{127}{}{Exactly!}
{127}{}{确切地！}
#{128}{}{[He growls in frustration] Fine! Listen, outsider. This bastard - [he points at the prisoner] - was supposed to watch the community's water pump. But when it overheated and had to be shut down, his dumb ass was asleep! Now we're all gonna die of thirst thanks to his carelessness! [he grabs the prisoner's hair and violently shakes his head back and forth]}
{128}{}{[他沮丧地咆哮]很好！听着，局外人。这个混蛋-[他指着囚犯]-本该看着社区的水泵。但当它过热，不得不关闭，他的蠢驴睡着了！多亏了他的粗心，我们都会渴死的！[他抓住犯人的头发，前后剧烈地摇摇头]}
#{129}{}{I can fix the water pump, if you give me time.}
{129}{}{如果你给我时间，我可以修水泵。}

#{133}{}{What if I buy his life?}
{133}{}{如果我买了他的命怎么办？}
#{134}{}{This really isn't any of my business. Do as you will.}
{134}{}{这真的不关我的事。你想怎么做就怎么做。}
#{135}{}{[His eyes blaze with anger] What?! What did you just say to me? Shut your mouth! Nobody asked you!}

#{138}{}{Yes, I'm a decent mechanic.}
{138}{}{是的，我是个不错的机械师。}
#{139}{}{No, but I have connections. This is going to be easy.}
{139}{}{不，但我有关系。这很容易。}
#{140}{}{Hmm... [he looks over at the crowd] Why should we trust you, outsider?}
{140}{}{隐马尔可夫模型。。。[他看着人群]我们为什么要相信你，局外人？}
#{141}{}{Do you have a choice?}
{141}{}{你有选择吗？}
#{142}{}{No, we don't... Fine. We won't kill him, at least for now. But he's not going anywhere until you fix the pump. And if you don't, I'll take care of him myself.}
{142}{}{不，我们不。。。好的。我们不会杀他，至少现在不会。但在你修好水泵之前他哪儿也不会去。如果你不去，我会自己照顾他。}
#{143}{}{What if I buy him out?}
{143}{}{如果我收买他呢？}
#{144}{}{Actually, I changed my mind. I don't care about that guy. Burn him!}

#{145}{}{Fine, we have a deal. I'll come back for him when the pump is fixed.}
{145}{}{好吧，我们说好了。泵修好后我会回来接他的。}

{148}{}{你让他多活了几天。}

#{162}{}{Fine, goddammit... Fine. This kid's lucky for your silver tongue. [leans in close] But I catch you doing anything dirty, anything at all, you're not walking out of here. Get it?}
{162}{}{好吧，该死的。。。好的。这孩子真幸运，你的舌头真好。但我发现你做了任何肮脏的事，任何事，你都不能离开这里。了解了？}
#{163}{}{Okay, Gerlach. I got it.}
{163}{}{好吧，杰拉克。我得到了它。}
#{164}{}{[He gives you a wild stare and hisses] Who the hell are you to know? You're going to give me - ME! - a lecture about life?! To a caravan guard with ten years of experience? Stop messing with me or get the hell away from here!}

{171}{}{哦，是你，局外人。你还在这里？}
#{172}{}{About the pump... }
{172}{}{关于泵。。。}
#{173}{}{Can I speak to the prisoner?}
{173}{}{我能和囚犯说话吗？}
#{174}{}{I want to buy the prisoner's life.}
{174}{}{我想买犯人的命。}
#{175}{}{}
{175}{}{}
#{176}{}{I'll come back later.}
{176}{}{我一会儿回来。}
#{177}{}{After all that's happened, I didn't even think we'd meet again.}
{177}{}{在这一切发生之后，我甚至没想到我们还会再见面。}
#{180}{}{What the hell for? You got a good reason, or are you just trying to help him escape?}
{180}{}{为什么？你有充分的理由，还是你只是想帮他逃走？}
#{181}{}{No way... }
{181}{}{不可能。。。}
#{182}{}{I want to talk to him about the repairing the pump.}
{182}{}{我想和他谈谈修理水泵的事。}
#{183}{}{Hmm. Fine, have it your way. You can talk to him. Rico's watching him in the next building.}
{183}{}{嗯。好吧，随你的便。你可以和他谈谈。里科在隔壁大楼看着他。}
#{184}{}{Thanks.}
{184}{}{谢谢。}
#{185}{}{I don't think so. His dumb ass broke the pump in the first place, and now you want his advice? Go ask a real mechanic and don't bother me with this crap.}
{185}{}{我不这么认为。一开始他就把水泵弄坏了，现在你想听听他的建议吗？去问问真正的机械师，别用这些废话来烦我。}
#{186}{}{Nice try, Mister Fixit. I know a working man's hands when I see them - you'll do just fine without that dumbass's help.}
{186}{}{干得好，修车先生。我知道一个工人的手，当我看到他们-你会做得很好，没有那个笨蛋的帮助。}
#{187}{}{Well, that didn't work.}
{187}{}{好吧，那没用。}
#{188}{}{We'll wait. For now, he's our prisoner.}
{188}{}{我们等着。现在，他是我们的囚犯。}
#{189}{}{Fair deal. [he hides the money in his pocket] He's free to go. But I can't figure why you give a damn about that idiot.}
{189}{}{公平交易。[他把钱藏在口袋里]他可以走了。但我不明白你为什么要管那个白痴。}
#{190}{}{You can't understand everything just with your mind, Gerlach. I'll see you around.}
{190}{}{你不可能只凭你的头脑就能理解一切，杰拉克。回头见。}
#{191}{}{Without the pump, we'll have no water. We'll have to leave this place.}
{191}{}{没有水泵，我们就没有水了。我们得离开这个地方。}
#{192}{}{What can be done?}
{192}{}{有什么办法？}
#{193}{}{I'm no mechanic, but some part of the pump seems to have broken. We've got two choices: find someone to repair it, or replace the part.}
{193}{}{我不是机械师，但泵的某些部分好像坏了。我们有两个选择：找人修理，或者更换零件。}
#{194}{}{What will I get in return if I fix the pump?}
{194}{}{如果我修了泵，我能得到什么回报？}
#{195}{}{I'll get the pump working for you.}
{195}{}{我来帮你把水泵修好。}
#{196}{}{I'll make it worth your while. I've got connections in... Well, it doesn't matter what kind of connections. I can get you a good weapon, if you're interested.}
{196}{}{我会让你觉得值得的。我在。。。好吧，什么样的关系并不重要。如果你有兴趣的话，我可以给你买件好武器。}
#{197}{}{I'll do it!}
{197}{}{我会的！}
#{198}{}{Not interested.}
{198}{}{不感兴趣。}
#{199}{}{Well, think of something. Or have you forgotten what you saw when you first arrived here? That was that idiot's last chance. Now think about the rest of the community - how long will they last without water?}
{199}{}{好吧，想想办法。或者你忘了你刚到这里时看到了什么？那是那个白痴最后的机会。现在想想社区的其他人――没有水他们还能活多久？}
#{200}{}{Of course, I'll try to help you.}
{200}{}{当然，我会尽力帮助你的。}
#{201}{}{You know, I don't care anymore. Deal with it yourself.}
{201}{}{你知道，我不在乎了。你自己处理吧。}
#{202}{}{Good! I look forward to any news from you. No one else here can deal with this.}
{202}{}{很好！我期待着你的任何消息。这里没人能处理这个。}
#{203}{}{Too bad, but I've got to go.}
{203}{}{太糟了，但我得走了。}
#{204}{}{The pump is working again.}
{204}{}{泵又工作了。}
#{205}{}{Really? We can drink fresh water again? I was starting to lose hope! Thank you. These dumbasses couldn't have done it on their own.}
{205}{}{真正地？我们又能喝淡水了？我开始失去希望了！非常感谢。这些笨蛋不可能自己做的。}
#{206}{}{What about my reward?}
{206}{}{我的报酬呢？}
#{207}{}{Don't mention it.}
{207}{}{不用谢。}
#{208}{}{I'll get you a decent weapon of your choice. What would you prefer?}
{208}{}{我会给你选一件像样的武器。你喜欢什么？}
#{209}{}{10mm pistol and some ammo.}
{209}{}{10毫米手枪和一些弹药。}
#{210}{}{10mm SMG with fully loaded clip.}
{210}{}{10mm SMG，带全负荷夹。}
#{211}{}{Cattle prod with some batteries.}
{211}{}{牛用电池戳。}
#{212}{}{7 frag grenades.}
{212}{}{7枚碎片手榴弹。}
#{213}{}{A double-barreled shotgun and 20 shells.}
{213}{}{一把双管猎枪和20发炮弹。}
#{214}{}{I think I'm good. Free that guy, it's all that matters.}
{214}{}{我觉得我很好。释放那个家伙，这才是最重要的。}
#{215}{}{I don't want anything. I'm leaving.}
{215}{}{我什么都不要。我要走了。}
#{216}{}{Are you serious? I've never seen anything like that. I won't make this offer a second time.}
{216}{}{你是认真的吗？我从没见过这样的事。我不会再提这个条件了。}
#{217}{}{You're right, there must be something wrong with me! I need a weapon.}
{217}{}{你说得对，我一定有毛病！我需要武器。}
#{218}{}{Let that guy go.}
{218}{}{放开那家伙。}
#{219}{}{I'm sure. I don't need anything. Take care.}
{219}{}{我肯定。我什么都不需要。当心。}
#{220}{}{Fine, I'll let Steve go.}
{220}{}{好吧，我放史蒂夫走。}
#{221}{}{Excellent!}
{221}{}{杰出的！}
#{222}{}{Hmm... Let me think. Yes, I can get you that SMG.}
{222}{}{隐马尔可夫模型。。。让我想想。是的，我可以帮你拿那个SMG。}
#{223}{}{Sounds good.}
{223}{}{听起来不错。}
#{224}{}{Yeah, yeah. He'd just better stay the hell out of my sight.}
{224}{}{是的，是的。他最好离我远点。}
#{225}{}{No problem.}
{225}{}{没问题。}
#{226}{}{Good choice! But you'll have to wait a day or two for my courier to pick up the package.}
{226}{}{不错的选择！但你得等一两天我的快递员来取包裹。}
#{227}{}{I'll wait then.}
{227}{}{那我就等。}
#{228}{}{My courier's not back yet. Just wait a little longer.}
{228}{}{我的信使还没回来。再等一会儿。}
#{229}{}{Okay.}
{229}{}{可以。}
#{230}{}{Here's your payment! It may not look like much, but it's the best I can give you. You take care of yourself, now.}
{230}{}{这是你的报酬！可能看起来不多，但这是我能给你的最好的。你照顾好自己，现在。}
#{231}{}{Fine.}

{236}{}{那么，我的报酬呢？}
#{237}{}{You got a cattle rod with some batteries.}
{237}{}{你有带电池的牛棍。}
#{238}{}{Cattle rod and some batteries for it.}
{238}{}{牛棍和一些电池。}
#{250}{}{Do you always execute people when they screw up?}
{250}{}{你总是在人们搞砸的时候处决他们吗？}
#{251}{}{His "screw up" threatened all of our lives. It was too much to forgive. Everyone must know our community won't tolerate this kind of carelessness.}
{251}{}{他的“搞砸”威胁到我们所有人的生命。这太让人无法原谅了。每个人都必须知道我们的社区不会容忍这种粗心大意。}
#{252}{}{Tough town. But I'll risk asking just one more question.}
{252}{}{艰难的城市。但我会冒险再问一个问题。}
#{253}{}{What are you, some kid fresh out of the vault, wanting to save the world? Ha! Don't make the old man laugh. If not for my rules, everyone here would be lost in the sands of the wasteland.}
{253}{}{你是什么，一个刚从保险库出来的孩子，想要拯救世界？哈！别逗老人笑。如果没有我的规矩，这里的每个人都会迷失在荒地的沙滩上。}
#{254}{}{Hey outsider, wait. Was that you sneaking around my house? No? Well, watch yourself - I don't want to see any bullshit from you. We solve those kinds of problems fast around here. Clear?}
{254}{}{嘿，外人，等等。是你在我家鬼鬼祟祟的吗？不？好吧，小心点-我不想看到你胡说八道。我们很快就解决了这些问题。明白了吗？}
#{255}{}{Uh, sure, clear. Whatever you say.}
{255}{}{嗯，当然，没问题。不管你说什么。}
#{270}{}{It sure is quiet around here lately, isn't it Gerlach?}
{270}{}{最近这里真的很安静，不是吗？}
#{271}{}{[He laughs bitterly] I didn't expect anything else from those idiots. A collective community... Where the fuck did I even get that bullshit? Every animal just wants to eat. But here, at least, they owned their meals. There? They'll just be someone's slaves. They paid for their food with their freedom.}
{271}{}{[他苦笑]我没想到那些白痴会给我什么。一个集体社区。。。我他妈的从哪弄来的？每只动物都想吃东西。但至少在这里，他们拥有自己的食物。在那里？他们只是某人的奴隶。他们用自己的自由为食物付钱。}
#{272}{}{Hmm, that's not far from the truth. But they made their choice.}
{272}{}{嗯，那离事实不远了。但他们做出了选择。}
#{273}{}{Well, Gerlach, your community is about to leave you. Are you aware of that?}
{273}{}{嗯，杰拉克，你的社区就要离开你了。你知道吗？}
#{274}{}{Idiots! I should have known. A collective community... Where the fuck did I even get that horseshit? Every animal just wants to eat. That's why they're leaving, so they'll know where their next meal is coming from. A utopia, in times like these.}
{274}{}{白痴！我早该知道的。一个集体社区。。。我他妈的从哪弄来的狗屎？每只动物都想吃东西。这就是他们离开的原因，这样他们就知道下顿饭从哪里来了。一个乌托邦，在这样的时代。}
#{275}{}{Hmm, you may be right. Time will tell.}
{275}{}{嗯，你可能是对的。时间会证明一切的。}
#{276}{}{As a representative of Vault 8, I propose that you come work for us in exchange for food, shelter and protection.}
{276}{}{作为保险库8的代表，我建议你来为我们工作，以换取食物、住所和保护。}
#{277}{}{Vault, you say? Hmm... I can't make that kind of decision. You can ask the people here yourself. But I'm not going anywhere!}
{277}{}{你说金库？隐马尔可夫模型。。。我不能做那种决定。你可以自己问问这里的人。但我哪儿也不去！}
#{278}{}{I'll go talk to the community then.}
{278}{}{那我就去社区谈谈。}
#{280}{}{Can you tell me the history of this place?}
{280}{}{你能告诉我这个地方的历史吗？}
#{281}{}{[He nods] With pleasure. You want the long or the short version?}
{281}{}{[他点头]很高兴。你要长版还是短版？}
#{282}{}{Short.}
{282}{}{很短。}
#{283}{}{Tell me everything.}
{283}{}{告诉我一切。}
#{284}{}{Forget it, I changed my mind.}
{284}{}{算了吧，我改变主意了。}
#{285}{}{Few years back, I offered the people I knew in Reno the chance to create our own community. Crazy enough, a few of them agreed, and we founded this place. After the first few raider attacks, we earned a good name for ourselves, and more people came. Now we're totally self-sufficient.}
{285}{}{几年前，我给我在里诺认识的人提供了创建自己社区的机会。太疯狂了，他们中的一些人同意了，我们建立了这个地方。在最初的几次袭击之后，我们为自己赢得了一个好名声，更多的人来了。现在我们完全自给自足了。}
#{286}{}{Tell me more!}
{286}{}{告诉我更多！}
#{287}{}{I think I've heard enough. Let's talk about something important now.}
{287}{}{我想我已经听够了。我们现在谈谈重要的事情。}
#{288}{}{Well, the real story goes back long before I actually came to this place. It started a long time back, probably about ten years ago.}
{288}{}{好吧，真正的故事要追溯到很久以前，我才真正来到这个地方。很早以前就开始了，大概十年前吧。}
#{289}{}{I'm listening.}
{289}{}{我在听。}
#{290}{}{Oh no, is it too late to get the short version?}
{290}{}{哦，不，现在买短版是不是太迟了？}
#{291}{}{Maybe we should end it at that. Take care.}
{291}{}{也许我们应该就此结束。当心。}
#{292}{}{I worked as a caravan guard back then. We wandered all over California - or what was left of her. Bad as it is now, it was worse then. Every town and village had at least one gang waiting to fuck you.}
{292}{}{那时候我当过商队警卫。我们在加州到处游荡――或者说她还剩下什么。虽然现在很糟糕，但那时更糟。每个城镇和村庄都至少有一帮人等着操你。}
#{293}{}{More?}
{293}{}{更多？}
#{294}{}{Caravan fell on hard times - our own people betraying us, or just walking away. Didn't do much for my opinion of people, let me tell you. But then... }
{294}{}{商队在艰难时期倒下了――我们自己的人背叛了我们，或者就这样走开了。我告诉你，我对别人的看法没什么帮助。但是。。。}
#{295}{}{We found a small village, all one big family. Inbred as all hell - you could see their kids were fucked up. But they protected their own, didn't even let us close to them.}
{295}{}{我们发现了一个小村庄，都是一个大家庭。近亲繁殖-你可以看到他们的孩子被搞砸了。但他们保护自己，甚至不让我们靠近他们。}
#{296}{}{Each of them would give their last drop of blood to protect their children. It surprised me. I was an orphan - I couldn't understand it.}
{296}{}{他们每个人都会献出最后一滴血来保护自己的孩子。我很惊讶。我是个孤儿-我不明白。}
#{297}{}{I thought about it for a long time. In the end, I realized, that's what we needed - a collective community where people don't just live for themselves, but for the common good. A small community where everyone would know each other, where everyone would be responsible for their work, where everyone would be *unified*. And anyone who couldn't pull their weight would be cast out.}
{297}{}{我想了很久。最后，我意识到，这就是我们所需要的――一个集体社区，人们不仅为自己而活，而且为共同利益而活。在一个小社区里，每个人都互相认识，每个人都对自己的工作负责，每个人都“团结一致”。任何一个不能控制自己体重的人都会被淘汰。}
#{298}{}{I talked to people in Reno about this. A lot of them laughed. But some of the others... They saw what I was saying.}
{298}{}{我和雷诺的人谈过这件事。很多人都笑了。但是其他一些。。。他们看到了我说的话。}
#{299}{}{Together, we found this place and actually made it livable! Now, most of them were killed by raiders early on, but we managed to fend them off. Once word got out, new people came.}
{299}{}{我们一起找到了这个地方，让它变得宜居！现在，他们中的大多数人很早就被袭击者杀死了，但我们设法把他们赶走了。消息一出，新来的人就来了。}
#{300}{}{Now we have everything we need. We're pretty much independent. And I hope it stays that way!}
{300}{}{现在我们需要的东西都有了。我们很独立。我希望它一直这样！}
#{301}{}{Thanks. I have no more questions, Mister Gerlach.}
{301}{}{谢谢。我没有问题了，杰拉克先生。}
#{310}{}{Has anyone from New Reno come here recently? His name's Mark. He was a prospector.}
{310}{}{最近有新里诺的人来过这里吗？他叫马克。他是个探矿者。}
#{311}{}{We haven't had new settlers in quite some time. Anyone coming to these parts probably went to Black Rock. They're taking in a lot of new people.}
{311}{}{我们已经很久没有新的定居者了。到这些地方来的人可能都去了黑岩。他们吸收了很多新人。}
#{312}{}{Thanks, that will be all.}
{312}{}{谢谢，就这些。}
#{313}{}{Do you know anything about Milo's disappearance?}
{313}{}{你知道米洛失踪的事吗？}
#{314}{}{No. Why should I? The desert's a dangerous place. Geckos, radscorpions, even raiders. If he doesn't come back, it's going to be hard on his wife. You understand.}
{314}{}{不，我为什么要？沙漠是个危险的地方。壁虎，蝎子，甚至袭击者。如果他不回来，他妻子会很难过的。你明白的。}
#{315}{}{Milo is married? Maybe I should talk to her.}
{315}{}{米洛结婚了？也许我应该和她谈谈。}
#{316}{}{Hmm... [looks at everybody] Perhaps... There is something about you, wanderer.}
{316}{}{隐马尔可夫模型。。。[看着每个人]也许。。。你有点不对劲，流浪汉。}
#{1120}{}{Not now, outsider. We'll talk after we deal with this - [spits in disgust] - piece of shit.}
{1120}{}{现在不行，局外人。我们处理完这事再谈-[恶心地吐口水]-狗屎。}
#{1126}{}{[Someone yells from the crowd] Gerlach, let her speak! She should know why we're doing this!}
{1126}{}{[人群中有人喊道]杰拉克，让她说话！她应该知道我们为什么要这么做！}
#{1128}{}{[He growls in frustration] Fine! Listen, outsider. This bastard - [he points at the prisoner] - was supposed to watch the community's water pump. But when it overheated and had to be shut down, his dumb ass was asleep! Now we're all gonna die of thirst thanks to his carelessness! [he grabs the prisoner's hair and violently shakes his head back and forth]}
{1128}{}{[他沮丧地咆哮]很好！听着，局外人。这个混蛋-[他指着囚犯]-本该看着社区的水泵。但当它过热，不得不关闭，他的蠢驴睡着了！多亏了他的粗心，我们都会渴死的！[他抓住犯人的头发，前后剧烈地摇摇头]}
#{1135}{}{[His eyes blaze with anger] What?! What did you just say to me? Shut your mouth! Nobody asked you!}
{1135}{}{什么？！你刚才对我说了什么？闭嘴！没人问你！}
#{1140}{}{Hmm... [he looks over at the crowd] Why should we trust you, outsider?}
{1140}{}{隐马尔可夫模型。。。[他看着人群]我们为什么要相信你，局外人？}
#{1144}{}{Actually, I changed my mind. I don't care about that guy. Burn him!}
{1144}{}{实际上，我改变主意了。我不在乎那个家伙。烧死他！}
#{1163}{}{Okay, Gerlach. I got it.}
{1163}{}{好吧，杰拉克。我得到了它。}
#{1170}{}{Ah, wanderer, come in! How can I help you?}
{1170}{}{啊，流浪汉，进来！我能帮你什么？}
#{1171}{}{Oh, it's you, outsider. You're still here?}
{1171}{}{哦，是你，局外人。你还在这里？}
#{1185}{}{I don't think so. His dumb ass broke the pump in the first place, and now you want his advice? Go ask a real mechanic and don't bother me with this crap.}
{1185}{}{我不这么认为。一开始他就把水泵弄坏了，现在你想听听他的建议吗？去问问真正的机械师，别用这些废话来烦我。}
#{1186}{}{Nice try, Miss Fixit. I know a working woman's hands when I see them - you'll do just fine without that dumbass's help.}
{1186}{}{干得好，菲希特小姐。我知道一个工作妇女的手，当我看到他们-你会做得很好，没有那个笨蛋的帮助。}
#{1217}{}{You're right, there must be something wrong with me! I need a weapon.}
{1217}{}{你说得对，我一定有毛病！我需要武器。}
#{1254}{}{Hey outsider, wait. Was that you sneaking around my house? No? Well, watch yourself - I don't want to see any bullshit from you. We solve those kinds of problems fast around here. Clear?}
{1254}{}{嘿，外人，等等。是你在我家鬼鬼祟祟的吗？不？好吧，小心点-我不想看到你胡说八道。我们很快就解决了这些问题。明白了吗？}
#{1284}{}{Forget it, I changed my mind.}
{1284}{}{算了吧，我改变主意了。}
#{1316}{}{Hmm... [looks at everybody] Perhaps... There is something about you, wanderer.}
{1316}{}{隐马尔可夫模型。。。[看着每个人]也许。。。你有点不对劲，流浪汉。}
