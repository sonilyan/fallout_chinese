#ОПИСАНИЕ КРИТТЕРА
#
# до знакомства
{1}{}{You see a handsome, well-built officer.}
{2}{}{His equipment is in perfect condition.}
#
# после знакомства
{3}{}{You see captain Richards.}
{4}{}{He reminds you of the Olympus itself - equally unshakeable and identifiable.}
#
#ЗДЕСЬ НАЧИНАЕТСЯ ДИАЛОГ
#
{10}{}{Greg? I started to think that you have taken roots in Tartarus, with all of your preachings. How are you doing? [you notice his badge, which reads "Cpt. Richards"]}
{11}{}{Douglas! If you are here, then you've brought all the stuff for these eggheads! Right? [you notice his badge, which reads "Cpt. Richards"]}
{12}{003}{Fine. Decided to rest a little.}
{13}{002}{I'm fine. Who're you?}
{14}{008}{As I see it, it's you who has taken roots in this place, Richards!}
{15}{012}{Yes, I gathered everything...}
{16}{011}{No, I decided to get some rest before venturing forth.}
{17}{020}{Yes sir! I brought everything.}
{18}{020}{No sir! I decided to get some rest before venturing forth.}

{20}{}{What? [he freezes for a moment] ALARM! AN INTRUDER HERE! GET HIM!}
{21}{998}{[fight]}

{30}{}{Ha, you still got a mouth on you! [he pauses] If you want to warm-up a little for old time's sake, I have a mission from Philipp Gray. Interested?}
{31}{004}{Sure, why not?}
{32}{007}{Maybe. Is there a reward for this warm-up?}

{40}{}{Then you're going to need good equipment. Your bathrobe won't do. Wait... [he takes out a worn-out armor and hands it to you. Then he gives you a small package] Here's a pheromone injection which you are gonna be using, and also the coordinates of an old bunker. A bunch of Chimeras inhabited the place, so, now it's their den, I guess. You will need to inject Queen Chimera with this shit and bring it to Gray. But remember this VERY well - our nerds said that the beast is really huge, so the effect of the serum won't last for more than a week. When you bring the Queen to me, I'll give you the key from a Biology level, where you meet Gray.}
{41}{005}{A Chimera's den? Couldn't you start with that?}
{42}{006}{Chimeras? I love Chimeras.}
{43}{999}{Sounds good! But I better, uh, go...}

{50}{}{Greg, don't tell me you've gone completely soft in this Tartarus. Come on, goddamn it, don't be a girl, It would be good for you! I can't look at what you are turning into.}
{51}{999}{Okay, I'm going to go get prepared for this "warm-up".}

{60}{}{[Richards laughs and pats you on the shoulder] Just like old times. After you finish with it, I suggest we go grab a drink.}
{61}{999}{Definitely.}

{70}{}{Ha, you're at it again. I think it's you who will be paying, just for a given chance to breathe some fresh air.}
{71}{004}{You wish... Okay, tell me details.}

{80}{}{[he laughs]Are you hinting that I owe you a case of booze because of the last argument? I had my arm broken! I couldn't go into Radius, so the bet is off!}
{81}{009}{Really? Well... Okay.}

{90}{}{By the way, if you want to warm-up a little for old time's sake, I have a mission from Philipp Gray. Interested?}
{91}{004}{Sure, why not?}
{92}{007}{Maybe. Is there a reward for this warm-up?}

{95}{}{I didn't mean you have to jump into a Chimera's lair right away, don't take me wrong! I think that it's actually a pretty dangerous assignment... So you should rest a little first. Talk to the guys around. By the way, Jock is getting too nervous lately - maybe you can help him. [he winks]}
{96}{004}{I'll keep that in mind.}

{110}{}{Damn, Doug, are you getting old? If I see you without this trash you're looking for our smart-asses, you're going to owe me a bottle of wine from Livos. No, a box! [he laughs] Okay, get some rest. And I guess I should write a report about why our nerds are not getting their toys in time.}
{111}{}{Do you remember about the wine? [he laughs] Okay, I'll let it slide this time. But I am going to remind you of it every chance I get! }
{112}{}{Damn, Doug, it's not funny anymore.  Next time you'll be the one writing the report.}
{113}{999}{Okay...}

{120}{}{That's how we do it! Let's check... [Richards looks through the list and nods] Good job. But I won't let you sit around! There's an urgent task from Philipp Gray. [he hands you a small package] Here - the coordinates and the serum. Your mission is to infiltrate the Chimera's den in an old bunker, inject Queen Chimera with the serum and bring her here. Questions? No questions. Come on, Doug, I'm counting on you.}
{121}{}{At last! I started to think that our eggheads will eat my brain. And don't forget, you owe me! Now let's check... [Richards looks through the list and nods] Good job. But I won't let you sit around! There's an urgent task from Philipp Gray. [he hands you a small package] Here - the coordinates and the serum. Your mission is to infiltrate the Chimera's den in an old bunker, inject Queen Chimera with the serum and bring her here. Questions? No questions. Dismissed.}
{122}{999}{[end of dialogue]}

{100}{}{Greg! I see your task went great...}
{101}{}{Greg, are you still here? I'm going to ask you to hurry - Grey is getting on my nerves.}
{102}{}{Douglas, I hope you are here not to loiter around, but to make me happy?}
{103}{}{Douglas! Glad you're made it... Holy shit, what a huge thing! Go, take her to Gray, I'm not actually a fan of these creatures.}
{104}{}{Douglas, I see you, but I don't see the Chimera. I'm going to assume that you still didn't venture into Radius.}
{105}{}{Greg, come by later, we'll go grab a drink, but now I'm a little busy...}
{106}{}{Douglas, I have no missions for you. Go and get some rest.}
{1001}{013}{[continue]}
{1002}{999}{I was just wrapping up some unfinished things. Moving out.}
{1003}{012}{Yes, I brought everything...}
{1004}{011}{No, I got back to get some rest before going on a mission.}
{1005}{014}{[continue]}
{1006}{999}{I'm going! Already going!}
{1007}{999}{Okay, I'll come later.}
{1008}{999}{Okay, I'll come later.}
{1009}{10a}{I wanted to clarify something: Jock has been mentioning some Timmy. Do you know who he is?}

{114}{}{Of course I know who he was! All these guys are like a family to me. And I remember Timmy, such a nice young lad. I heard the rumors about Jock bullying him, but never witnessed the thing with my own eyes. Fellas have been saying that Jock made Timmy go into the Purgatory for something - and no one saw Timmy since... Believe me, I won't let some shit like this happen again.}
{115}{999}{I see. Okay, I need to go do my job.}

{130}{}{I know you would handle it better than anyone! We are an old school, after all. Okay, now I'm going to ask you to take this thing to Gray, and fast - I'm not a fan of them, unlike Philipp, and I would prefer to rip its guts instead of giving her a tour around the place. [he hands you a keycard] Here, use it to get to an Organic level, or how was it... Okay, take this holy shit away from me.}
{131}{999}{Okay.}

{140}{}{[he hands you a keycard] Here, use it to get to an Organic level, or how was it... Okay, take this holy shit away from me.}
{141}{999}{Okay.}

{200}{}{Sir? What the hell is wrong with you? }
{201}{022}{Just an old habit. Picked it in Radius. It has some tough stuff going on, you know.}
{202}{021}{Uhh...}

{210}{}{Do you even remember my name?}
{211}{002}{Captain?}
{212}{002}{Richards?}
{213}{002}{John?}
{214}{002}{Eddie?}

{222}{}{Looks like the idea to give you "an interesting mission outside of Olympus" was not that great...}
{220}{012}{It's alright, really! As I said, I brought everything.}
{221}{011}{It's alright, really! I just needed to get some rest.}
