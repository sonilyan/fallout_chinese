### {10}{}{[The ghoul walks circles around the man's bloodied corpse, fending off flies. Suddenly, he jumps to the body and starts shaking it by the shoulders] Come on, reborn, you fucking idiot! Why do I have to wait for you for so long? [seeing you, he puts his rotten finger to his toothless mouth] Shhh! Quiet! The reborn is in progress!!}
{10}{}{【食尸鬼绕着那人血迹斑斑的尸体转了一圈，挡住了苍蝇。突然，他跳到尸体前，开始摇晃尸体的肩膀】来吧，重生吧，你这个该死的白痴！为什么我要等你这么久？[看到你，他把腐烂的手指放在没有牙齿的嘴里]嘘！轻声的重生正在进行中！！}

{13}{999}{我想我最好离开。}


### {1001}{}{[seeing you, he friendly nods with his wrinkled, skinny skull, covered with sticking remains of hair. His eyes are feverishly bulging out, arms clinging belt of a shotgun, hanging on his back.] Howdy, stranger! Did you come to witness a moment of Lenny and Carl's reunion? }
{1001}{}{[见到你了，他友好地点头，他那布满皱纹、瘦骨嶙峋的头骨上长满了粘在一起的头发。他的眼睛狂热地瞪大，双臂紧紧抓住挂在背上的猎枪腰带。]你好，陌生人！你是来见证莱尼和卡尔重聚的吗？}
### {101}{011}{Uhh... What are you talking about?}
{101}{011}{嗯。。。你在说什么？}
### {102}{019}{Reunion? Are you going to shag him, or something?}
{102}{019}{重聚你打算和他上床吗？}

{104}{999}{没有，我只是路过。}
### {1002}{}{[tries to hug you with his skinny, saggy hands, giving you a smell of decay, sweat, and rotten food] My friend! I'm so glad to see you! I have a whole colony of some bugs under my shoulder blade - can you help me to put them out?}
{1002}{}{[试图用他瘦骨嶙峋的手拥抱你，给你一股腐烂、汗水和腐烂食物的味道]我的朋友！见到你我很高兴！我的肩胛骨下有一群虫子，你能帮我把它们扑灭吗？}
### {105}{019}{Get lost, you freak, until I puked all over this wrinkled ass-head of yours!!}
{105}{019}{迷路吧，你这个怪胎，直到我吐了你这个满是皱纹的屁股！！}

{106}{999}{我也很高兴见到你，莱尼。我现在没有时间，但我以后一定会见到你的。}
### {1003}{}{[he stops peeling scrubs on his sunken chest and nods] Oh. it's you! You're lucky to see me - my fella is hanging out somewhere, I'm going to go look for him.}
{1003}{}{[他停止在凹陷的胸部上剥磨砂膏，点了点头]哦。是你！你很幸运看到我――我的伙计在某个地方闲逛，我要去找他。}
### {107}{999}{Good luck with the search. I need to go.}
{107}{999}{祝你搜索顺利。我得走了。}
### {108}{019}{He just decided to screw you over. Looks like even the ghouls take you for a freak, ha-ha!}
{108}{019}{他只是决定搞砸你。看起来连食尸鬼都把你当成怪物，哈哈！}
### {1004}{}{[considering he has no lips, you can't understand if he is smiling or angry at you] You're still here, stranger? I'm going to get out. Somehow, no one wants to talk to me here. I wish Carl was around...}
{1004}{}{[考虑到他没有嘴唇，你无法理解他是在对你微笑还是生气]你还在这里，陌生人？我要出去。不知怎么的，这里没人愿意和我说话。我希望卡尔在身边。。。}
### {109}{999}{Good luck, ghoul. Maybe your life gets better someday.}
{109}{999}{祝你好运，食尸鬼。也许有一天你的生活会变得更好。}
### {1010}{019}{That's right, get the hell out! Ugly freaks like you should be shot on sight!}
{1010}{019}{没错，滚出去！像你这样丑陋的怪胎应该被当场枪决！}


### {110}{}{What's here you can't see? Are you thick or something? No worries, I'll explain... I'm Lenny, this is my best friend Carl. We used to hang around Radius together, looking for loot. Everything was good with the two of us. But one time I decided to go alone - into some old ruins, where Geiger counter screams non-stop. And I stepped on a mine. Carl found the pile of shit I became and got me out, but I still received enough radiation. The result is in front of you.}
{110}{}{你看不见的是什么？你是不是很胖？不用担心，我会解释。。。我叫莱尼，这是我最好的朋友卡尔。我们过去常常一起在Radius附近寻找战利品。我们俩一切都很好。但有一次我决定独自一人去一些古老的废墟里，盖革计数器不停地尖叫。我踩到了地雷。卡尔发现了我变成的一堆大便，把我救了出来，但我仍然受到了足够的辐射。结果就在你面前。}
### {111}{012}{And? How does this explain the current situation?}
{111}{012}{和这如何解释目前的情况？}


### {120}{}{[he spits out a fountain of green saliva, scratching a hole, which was once his nose] It's obvious, you see - Carl needs to become a ghoul too! And then we will continue doing our things together! I did everything by the book - put a grenade into his toilet, carried him into the same ruins I was in. Then I waited for some time and brought him back here, so he could be reborn in comfort. I even reserved the table in the bar to celebrate! See? He's already changing! Look at these spots on his skin. And the smell...}
{120}{}{[他吐出一股绿色的唾液，抓了一个洞，这个洞曾经是他的鼻子]很明显，你看，卡尔也需要成为一个食尸鬼！然后我们将继续一起做我们的事情！我照章办事――把一枚手榴弹放进他的厕所，把他带到我所在的废墟里。然后我等了一段时间，把他带回了这里，这样他就可以舒适地重生了。我甚至预定了酒吧的桌子来庆祝！看见他已经在变了！看看他皮肤上的这些斑点。气味。。。}
### {121}{019}{You... Your brains are completely eaten away by radiation, you freak! You should be put down before you start attacking people on the streets!}
{121}{019}{你你的大脑被辐射完全吞噬了，你这个怪胎！在你开始攻击街上的人之前，你应该被打倒！}
### {122}{013}{This is called decay. Your friend is literally dead.}
{122}{013}{这叫做衰变。你的朋友真的死了。}
### {123}{999}{It's... Unusual. I may be able to help you, but first I need to think it over.}
{123}{999}{这是。。。特别的我也许能帮你，但首先我需要考虑一下。}


### {130}{}{No! Don't you dare to piss into my ears! Carl's alive! I just need to wait for a little more! If you don't want to help - move along!}
{130}{}{不你敢往我耳朵里撒尿！卡尔还活着！我只需要再等一会儿！如果你不想帮忙，那就继续前进！}
### {131}{019}{I should put you down, you sick freak. Out of pity, at least.}
{131}{019}{我应该放下你，你这个变态。至少出于怜悯。}
### {132}{999}{Calm down. Let's talk about it later.}
{132}{999}{冷静我们稍后再谈。}


### {140}{}{[he squints] What's there to discuss? It's all obvious.}
{140}{}{[他斜视]有什么要讨论的？这一切都是显而易见的。}
### {141}{015}{I just wanted to say that I can cover for you here. Maybe you need to go away for something.}
{141}{015}{我只是想说，我可以在这里为你做掩护。也许你需要离开去做点什么。}
### {142}{016}{Listen, your friend is dead. You know it, you just don't want to admit it. And if you go on like this... You wanted to do what's best, but - do you realize that you killed your only friend?}
{142}{016}{听着，你的朋友死了。你知道，你就是不想承认。如果你继续这样下去。。。你想做最好的事，但你意识到你杀了你唯一的朋友吗？}
### {143}{016}{Hey, it's wrong to let dead people lay around! Until you bury the body, he won't be at peace! So, do it - and you can be sure he will wait for you on the other side.}
{143}{016}{嘿，让死人躺着是不对的！除非你把尸体埋了，否则他不会平静的！所以，去做吧――你可以肯定他会在另一边等你的。}
### {144}{018}{Lenny, your friend just screwed you over! You worked so hard, and he isn't even thinking about being reborn! You know, I can be your new best friend!}
{144}{018}{莱尼，你的朋友刚刚把你搞砸了！你这么努力，他甚至没有想过要重生！你知道，我可以成为你最好的新朋友！}
### {145}{019}{I see how it is. I should put you out of your misery. Get ready, ghoul.}
{145}{019}{我明白了。我应该让你摆脱痛苦。准备好了，食尸鬼。}
### {146}{999}{You are right, we have nothing to talk about for now.}
{146}{999}{你是对的，我们现在没有什么可谈的。}

### {150}{}{[he loudly exhales, fending off the flies] At last! The only normal guy around here! I'm already getting tired of carrying him around. And you're just in time, I need to take off some load real fast... Don't worry, I'll be right back. [he runs off, unzipping his pants in the process]}
{150}{}{[他大声呼气，挡开了苍蝇]终于！这里唯一的正常人！我已经厌倦了带他到处走了。你来得正是时候，我需要很快卸下一些负载。。。别担心，我马上回来。[他跑了，在这个过程中拉开了裤子的拉链]}
### {151}{020}{Take your time... [wait for him to get out of your sight, then call for your ghoul ally and utilize Carl's body]}
{151}{020}{慢慢来。。。[等他离开你的视线，然后召唤你的食尸鬼盟友并利用卡尔的尸体]}
### {152}{999}{I need to do something else. Lie here for now, Carl. }
{152}{999}{我需要做些别的事情。暂时躺在这里，卡尔。}

### {160}{}{[Looks like Lenny is going to throw himself at you at any moment... But he starts sobbing instead] Man, I screwed up, big time... Murdered my best bud! What's wrong with me? Looks like my brains got completely messed up from that explosion... You... Thanks for your compassion. No one gives a shit about anyone around here... You know, actually, you're right!! We can meet with him on the other side!!! [suddenly, he drops his shotgun from shoulder and puts it to his belly]}
{160}{}{[看来莱尼随时都会扑向你。。。但他却开始哭泣。。。谋杀了我最好的宝贝！我怎么了？看起来我的大脑完全被那次爆炸搞砸了。。。你谢谢你的同情。这里没有人在乎任何人。。。事实上，你是对的！！我们可以在另一边和他见面！！！[突然，他把猎枪从肩上放下，放在肚子上]}
### {161}{999}{Uhh...}
{161}{999}{嗯。。。}

### {170}{}{[Looks like Lenny is going to throw himself at you at any moment... But he starts sobbing instead] Man, I screwed up, big time... Murdered my best bud! What's wrong with me? Looks like my brains got completely messed up from that explosion... You... Thanks for your compassion. No one gives a shit about anyone around here... I don't have much, but still - take my bullets, you can trade them for batteries.}
{170}{}{[看起来莱尼随时都会扑向你……但他却开始哭泣]伙计，我搞砸了，大人物。。。谋杀了我最好的宝贝！我怎么了？看起来我的大脑完全被那次爆炸搞砸了。。。你谢谢你的同情。这里没有人在乎任何人。。。我没有多少，但还是――拿着我的子弹，你可以用它们换电池。}
### {171}{999}{Thanks, Lenny. I'll make good use of them.}
{171}{999}{谢谢，莱尼。我会好好利用它们。}

### {180}{}{[he stares at the corpse, sometimes looking at you. For a moment, his sight becomes clear - but then it is immediately clouded by madness.] Damn, you are so right! I am busting my ass here for him, and he... Man, I'm so lucky to have you opening my eyes! Lemme hug you... Oh! Wait! Take this - as a sign of our friendship! [hands you his shotgun] And I need to go drop this pile of shit into a cesspool. [he grabs corpse by its feet and drags it somewhere]}
{180}{}{[他盯着尸体，有时还看着你。一时间，他的视线变得清晰起来，但随后立即被疯狂笼罩。]妈的，你说得太对了！我在这里为他拼命，而他。。。伙计，我很幸运有你睁开我的眼睛！让我拥抱你。。。哦等待把这个当作我们友谊的象征！[把他的猎枪递给你]我得把这堆屎扔进污水池。[他抓住尸体的脚，把它拖到某处]}
### {181}{999}{Thanks, uh... Friend. Won't bother you anymore.}
{181}{999}{谢谢，呃。。。朋友不会再打扰你了。}

### {190}{}{[He may be crazy, but not slow. Shotgun, hanging out on his back, now magically appears in his hands, pointing at you] What did you just say, you son of a bitch?! Carl, come on, get up - there's another asshole to put down!}
{190}{}{[他可能疯了，但速度不慢。背上挂着的猎枪现在神奇地出现在他的手中，指着你]你刚才说什么，你这个婊子养的？！卡尔，来吧，站起来――还有一个混蛋要放下！}
### {191}{998}{Your first, dead meat!}
{191}{998}{你的第一个，死肉！}
### {192}{998}{Yeah, go try it...}
{192}{998}{是的，去试试吧。。。}

### {200}{}{[The plan goes down rather swimmingly. Seeing reborn "Carl", Lenny starts to jump around, yelling with excitement. Delighted, he hands you his shotgun. Then the couple walks away in the bar's direction.]}
{200}{}{[这个计划进展得相当顺利。看到重生的“卡尔”，莱尼开始跳来跳去，兴奋地大叫。很高兴，他把猎枪递给你。然后，这对夫妇朝酒吧的方向走去。]}
### {201}{999}{That was too easy. And quite bizarre.}
{201}{999}{那太容易了。而且很奇怪。}

### {500}{}{What do you want? [he patiently looks at you]}
{500}{}{你想要什么？[他耐心地看着你]}
### {501}{}{An outsider? What do you need?}
{501}{}{一个局外人？你需要什么？}
### {502}{}{You again? Is there something you want?}
{502}{}{你又来了？你想要什么吗？}
### {503}{}{There's an option for you to obtain the support of one nice guy... Of your kind. With a shotgun [wink]. All you need is to substitute yourself for another man's corpse.}
{503}{}{你可以选择获得一个好人的支持。。。你的同类。用猎枪[眨眼]。你所需要的只是用另一个人的尸体代替自己。}
### {504}{}{Nothing, just walking around.}
{504}{}{没什么，只是四处走走。}
### {505}{}{Not impressed. Deal with it yourself.}
{505}{}{没有留下深刻印象。自己处理。}
### {506}{}{You know, it actually sounds like a good idea! I could use a friend with a shotgun. Lately, there are strange rumors going around, about the Drop... What do you need me to do?}
{506}{}{你知道，这听起来确实是个好主意！我可以用一个带猎枪的朋友。最近，有一些奇怪的谣言在流传，关于Drop。。。你需要我做什么？}
### {507}{}{Great! I will find you when the moment is right!}
{507}{}{太棒了时机成熟时我会找到你的！}
### {508}{}{Okay, it's your decision... [squint and leave]}
{508}{}{好吧，这是你的决定。。。[斜视离开]}
