#{302}{}{That monster will be gone from my place on the double! And you with it.}
{302}{}{那个怪物会从我的替身上消失！你也能接受。}
#{400}{}{I'm not going to tolerate this in here!}
{400}{}{我不能容忍这里发生这种事！}

#{505}{}{Nothing at all. Goodbye.}
{505}{}{什么都没有。再见。}
#{550}{}{I'm glad to hear it. The price is a mere 150 caps. If you want, you can look all of my girls over first. I'm sure you'll find something you like. And if you're low on cash at the moment, you could always rent my brahmin Dolly for 20 caps. That's a very popular service among the miners.}
{550}{}{我很高兴听到这个消息。价格只有150英镑。如果你愿意，你可以先看看我所有的女孩。我相信你会找到你喜欢的东西。如果你现在现金不足，你可以以20英镑的价格租我的双头牛洋娃娃。那是矿工中很受欢迎的服务。}
#{551}{}{I'd prefer a girl. Here are 150 caps.}
{551}{}{我更喜欢一个女孩。这儿有150顶瓶盖。}
#{552}{}{I'll try the brahmin, why not. Here are 20 caps.}

#{553}{}{Here are 150 caps for a girl - for Keri. She will surely not refuse.}
{553}{}{这是给一个女孩的150顶瓶盖――给克里的。她一定不会拒绝的。}
#{554}{}{[Give her 150 caps.] I'm paying for Lystra, to try something new.}
{554}{}{[给她150个瓶盖]我付钱给莱斯特拉，试试新东西。}
#{555}{}{[Give her 150 caps.] I'm paying for Gabriel, to let him enjoy himself a little.}
{555}{}{[给她150个瓶盖]我付钱给加布里埃尔，让他玩得开心一点。}
#{556}{}{Right, I will take a look around first. See you later.}
{556}{}{好的，我先四处看看。再见。}
#{600}{}{[She takes your money.] Have you chosen already, or should I choose for you?}
{600}{}{[她拿走了你的钱]你已经选择了，还是我应该为你选择？}
#{601}{}{[She takes your money.] Have you chosen already, or should I choose for you?}
{601}{}{[她拿走了你的钱]你已经选择了，还是我应该为你选择？}
#{602}{}{I'll leave the choice to you.}
{602}{}{我把选择权留给你。}
#{603}{}{Take me to Abby.}
{603}{}{带我去找艾比。}
#{604}{}{I want to have Marylin.}
{604}{}{我想要马里林。}
#{605}{}{Take me to Suzan.}
{605}{}{带我去苏姗。}
#{606}{}{I've chosen Trixie.}

#{701}{}{[Follow her to the girl.]}
{701}{}{[跟着她去找那个女孩。]}
#{750}{}{You'll find Suzan in the first room on the right. Don't press her too much, she's pretty shaken up from the attack, poor thing.}
{750}{}{你会在右边的第一个房间找到苏姗。别逼她太多了，她已经被袭击吓坏了，可怜的家伙。}
#{751}{}{I'll try.}
{751}{}{我试试看。}
#{800}{}{Him? [She frowns.] He's been standing around for a few days now and he never spends a cap. I'm surprised he even had the courage to ask you. But OK, we can make an arrangement. Otherwise I wouldn't make any money on him anyway. The standard rate is 150 caps. And this miner of yours must give me a third of that. In exchange, you can use one of my rooms. The one at the end of the hall on the left is free right now. What do you say?}
{800}{}{他？[她皱眉]他已经站了好几天了，从来没花过一顶瓶盖。我很惊讶他竟然有勇气问你。但是好吧，我们可以做个安排。否则我就不会靠他赚钱了。标准价格是150英镑。你的矿工必须给我三分之一。作为交换，你可以用我的房间。左边大厅尽头的那个现在是空的。你怎么说？}
#{801}{}{It's a deal. See you later, Wanda.}
{801}{}{就这么定了。再见，旺达。}
#{802}{}{I'd rather not. Let's forget it.}
{802}{}{我宁愿不要。算了吧。}
#{850}{}{I hope you've gotten your money's worth. [Wanda smiles.] Just before you leave, I have a proposition for you. I need to obtain a certain something and you seem the right person to get it. You're certainly more right than most of my local clients.}
{850}{}{我希望你的钱物有所值。在你离开之前，我有一个提议给你。我需要得到某种东西，而你似乎是得到它的合适人选。你肯定比我的大多数本地客户都对。}
#{851}{}{I hope you've gotten your money's worth. [Wanda smiles.] Just before you leave, I have a proposition for you. I need to obtain a certain something and you seem the right person to get it. You're certainly more right than most of my local clients.}
{851}{}{我希望你的钱物有所值。在你离开之前，我有一个提议给你。我需要得到某种东西，而你似乎是得到它的合适人选。你肯定比我的大多数本地客户都对。}
#{852}{}{I'm listening.}
{852}{}{我在听。}
#{900}{}{It's like this. One of my girls has a sister here in Iron District. The sister looks just like her, they are both very attractive and having them both here would certainly attract customers. However, Valery, unlike her sister Abby, lives with one miner and doesn't want to work for me. But I won't believe she cannot be convinced. There must be one hundred ways to do it, especially for someone like you. If you'd do it, I'd pay you handsomely.}
{900}{}{就像这样。我的一个女儿在铁区有个妹妹。姐姐长得和她一模一样，她们都很吸引人，把她们俩都带到这里一定能吸引顾客。然而，瓦莱丽，不像她的妹妹艾比，住在一个矿工，不想为我工作。但我不相信她不会被说服。一定有一百种方法可以做到，尤其是对于像你这样的人。如果你愿意，我会给你丰厚的报酬。}
#{901}{}{I'm on it.}
{901}{}{我会的。}
#{902}{}{I would never do a thing like that. Goodbye.}
{902}{}{我决不会做那样的事。再见。}
#{950}{}{You'll find Valery in the house across from Nestor's villa. I hope you won't fail me.}
{950}{}{你会在内斯特别墅对面的房子里找到瓦莱里。我希望你不会让我失望。}
#{951}{}{Don't you worry.}
{951}{}{别担心。}
#{1000}{}{Welcome. What can I offer you this time?}
{1000}{}{欢迎光临。这次我能给你什么？}
#{1001}{}{I'd like a girl.}
{1001}{}{我想要个女孩。}
#{1002}{}{I'd like to pay for a girl for the whole week. How much would Abby cost?}

#{1050}{}{I'm glad you like it here. The price is still 150 caps per hour.}
{1050}{}{很高兴你喜欢这里。价格仍然是每小时150顶。}
#{1051}{}{I'm glad you like it here. The price is still 150 caps per hour. And now I can also offer you two girls at once: the sisters, Abby and Valery. For you only at half-price, 200 caps.}
{1051}{}{很高兴你喜欢这里。价格仍然是每小时150顶。现在我可以同时给你们两个女孩：艾比和瓦莱里姐妹。只给你半价，200顶。}
#{1052}{}{In that case, I'll take the two sisters.}
{1052}{}{那样的话，我就带这两个姐妹去。}
#{1053}{}{OK. I'll leave the choice to you.}
{1053}{}{好 啊。我把选择权留给你。}
#{1054}{}{One girl is enough. I'll leave the choice to you.}
{1054}{}{一个女孩就够了。我把选择权留给你。}
#{1055}{}{Take me to Abby.}

#{1101}{}{[Follow her to them.]}

#{1150}{}{[She makes an angry face.] Now why would you do a thing like that? Is it by any chance connected with the job you're doing for me?}
{1150}{}{[她一脸生气]现在你为什么要做那样的事？这和你为我做的工作有关吗？}
#{1151}{}{[She makes an angry face.] Now why would you do a thing like that? Is it by any chance connected with the job you're doing for me?}

#{1152}{}{Well... Yes. I think that in a week Abby could convince Valery to start working for you.}
{1152}{}{好。。。对。我想一周后艾比就能说服瓦莱里开始为你工作了。}
#{1153}{}{Um, not really.}
{1153}{}{嗯，不太好。}
#{1200}{}{I don't know. The two of them are sisters, granted, but they're not really chummy. Abby always mentions Valery with contempt. But you haven't come up with anything better, have you? So OK, you can rent Abby for a week. And at a good rate. All it will cost is 400 caps.}
{1200}{}{我不知道。他们两个是姐妹，当然，但他们不是真正的好朋友。艾比总是轻蔑地提到瓦莱里。但你还没有想出更好的办法，是吗？好吧，你可以租艾比一个星期。而且速度很快。总共需要400顶瓶盖。}

{1202}{}{同意。这是钱。}
#{1203}{}{I don't have that much on me. Forget it.}
{1203}{}{我身上没那么多。算了吧。}
#{1250}{}{Well, Valery is working for me now, together with Abby. Whatever you did to get her here, you've earned the money. [She gives you 500 caps.] I'm convinced the investment will pay off very soon.}
{1250}{}{好吧，瓦莱里现在和艾比一起为我工作。不管你做了什么让她来，你都赚了钱。[她给你500个上限]我相信这笔投资很快就会有回报。}

{1300}{}{[她拿走了你的钱]那女孩在等你。}
#{1301}{}{[Follow her.]}
{1301}{}{[跟着她。]}
#{1350}{}{You've missed your chance. Abby quit, so I don't need Valery any more. What's more, the two apparently now live together. That stupid bitch must really think she'll be better off this way. [She winces.] She's just ruined her life.}
{1350}{}{你错过了机会。艾比辞职了，所以我不再需要瓦莱里了。更重要的是，两人现在显然住在一起。那个愚蠢的婊子一定真的认为这样会更好。她毁了自己的生活。}

#{1352}{}{You can't know that. Bye.}
{1352}{}{你不会知道的。再见。}
#{1400}{}{You can forget your money. You plan has failed. Valery has somehow convinced Abby to leave this place. That stupid bitch must really think she'll be better off like this. [She winces.] She's just ruined her life.}
{1400}{}{你可以把钱忘了。你的计划失败了。瓦莱里说服了艾比离开这里。那个愚蠢的婊子一定真的认为她这样会更好。她毁了自己的生活。}
#{1401}{}{You can't know that. Bye.}
{1401}{}{你不会知道的。再见。}
#{1450}{}{I still can't believe what that disgusting madman did. Not only did he kill Suzan, he cut out her tongue as well. [She sighs.] Why did she have to go there? She hasn't been drawing too many customers lately, but still I made a pretty penny on her.}
{1450}{}{我还是不敢相信那个恶心的疯子做了什么。他不仅杀了苏珊，还割下了她的舌头。她为什么要去那里？她最近没有吸引太多顾客，但我还是从她身上赚了不少钱。}
#{1451}{}{Yes, I believe you did. Goodbye Wanda.}
{1451}{}{是的，我相信你有。再见，万达。}
#{1500}{}{The girl is waiting. [She takes Keri to her.]}

#{1601}{}{[Let him enjoy his 60 minutes.]}
{1601}{}{[让他享受他的60分钟。]}
#{1650}{}{In that case, I don't see why I should allow it. I need Abby here. She has been very popular among the customers lately.}
{1650}{}{那样的话，我不明白为什么我应该允许。我需要艾比在这里。她最近在顾客中很受欢迎。}
#{1651}{}{As you wish. Bye.}
{1651}{}{如你所愿。再见。}
