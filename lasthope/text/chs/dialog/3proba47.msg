You have to help me, everyone else thinks there's nothing to worry about but they are so wrong.}
{104}{}{有一件紧急的事情不能再等了。伦纳德不明白，但我需要尽快更换等离子体变压器，我们什么都不做只是在找麻烦。你必须帮助我，其他人都认为没什么可担心的，但他们错了。}

### {119}{}{No, I don't have it.}

### {126}{}{OK.}
{126}{}{好啊}

{127}{}{[零件更换后几分钟，一切仍然正常。听起来更好，你注意到了。]很好。。。甚至声音也不一样，干得好。我会再做几次测试，看看它有多稳定。对不起，现在。。。}
