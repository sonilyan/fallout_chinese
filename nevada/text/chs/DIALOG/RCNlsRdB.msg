#{100}{}{You see Kelly.}
{100}{}{你看到凯利了。}
#{101}{}{You see a miner armed with a rifle. His look is cold and piercing.}
{101}{}{你看到一个拿着步枪的矿工。他的表情冷峻刺骨。}
#{110}{}{Sheriff?}
{110}{}{警长？}
#{111}{}{Yes?}
{111}{}{对？}
#{112}{}{Bye.}
{112}{}{再见。}
#{113}{}{I'm in haste to deliver the news about Tony's death.}
{113}{}{我正赶着把托尼的死讯传出去。}
#{114}{}{[Kelly didn't even flinch] Thanks, I'll keep in mind.}
{114}{}{[凯利甚至没有退缩]谢谢，我会记住的。}
#{115}{}{Aren't you a cold-blooded guy. Okay, I'll go tell everyone else.}
{115}{}{你不是个冷血的家伙吗。好吧，我去告诉其他人。}
#{116}{}{I'm going to finish off the mutants in the mine. Are you with me?}
{116}{}{我要干掉矿井里的变种人。你和我在一起吗？}
#{117}{}{Do you really know what to do? I'm not sure I should help you.}
{117}{}{你真的知道该怎么办吗？我不确定我是否应该帮助你。}
#{118}{}{So, will you help me?}
{118}{}{那么，你能帮我吗？}
#{119}{}{Maybe you'd advise something in terms of weapons for fighting mutants?}
{119}{}{也许你会给我一些关于对付变种人的武器的建议？}
#{120}{}{If you're bad with the weapons, then stay away from the mine. Worms are serious threat, they can't be shot down with a single bullet. Ask for access to the arsenal from Marilyn, dynamite from Nelson or just hack this damn safe with weapons. Oh, yes, Nelson should still have some ammo cartridges left.}
{120}{}{如果你不擅长武器，那就离地雷远点。蠕虫是一种严重的威胁，它们不可能被一颗子弹击落。从玛丽莲那里弄到军火库，从尼尔森那里弄到炸药，或者干脆用武器破解这个该死的保险箱。哦，是的，纳尔逊应该还有一些弹药筒。}
#{121}{}{Marylin has an arsenal?}
{121}{}{马里林有军火库？}
#{122}{}{Nelson holds dynamite in reserve?}
{122}{}{尼尔森拿着炸药？}
#{123}{}{What safe you were talking about?}
{123}{}{你在说什么保险箱？}
#{124}{}{Could you tell me about ammo, please?}
{124}{}{你能告诉我弹药的情况吗？}
#{125}{}{The cabinet in the bar, easy to see. Only she wouldn't give it all away just like that. However, there's nothing really powerful.}
{125}{}{吧台里的柜子，很容易看。只是她不会就这样把一切都泄露出去。然而，没有什么真正强大的。}
#{126}{}{Yes, the mine has a room where Nelson pulled the last stocks of dynamite. Very little of that left. }
{126}{}{是的，矿上有一个房间，纳尔逊在那里取出最后一批炸药。剩下的很少了。}
#{127}{}{He carries the key to the doors with him, on his neck. So you have to negotiate somehow.}
{127}{}{他脖子上带着门的钥匙。所以你必须协商。}
#{128}{}{Safe in the guild's building. We have long laid eyes on it, but who would have opened? The irony is that everyone knows about the content. The owner safely died in the mine, during the first appearance of mutants. He did not yet know what had happened under the ground, he thought it was another drunk joke of the workers, so he left his submachine gun with ammo in the safe and went downstairs. That's it.}
{128}{}{在公会大楼里安全。我们早就注意到了，但谁会打开它呢？讽刺的是，每个人都知道内容。矿主在突变体第一次出现时安全地死在了矿井里。他还不知道地下发生了什么事，他以为这是工人们又一次酒后开玩笑，于是把装有弹药的冲锋枪放在保险箱里，下楼去了。就这样。}
#{129}{}{I saw Nelson making ammo when he still had a sawed-off shotgun, surely he hid them somewhere at home. If I had the skills and the bench, I could make coin shot ammo for a shotgun. Just what you need for shooting worms.}
{129}{}{我看到纳尔逊还在做弹药，他还拿着一把锯下来的猎枪，肯定把枪藏在家里的某个地方了。如果我有技术和板凳，我可以为猎枪制造投币子弹。正是你射虫子所需要的。}
#{130}{}{Thanks for the help, this should be enough.}
{130}{}{谢谢你的帮助，这应该够了。}
#{131}{}{You can use me as a bait and shoot the mutants yourself.}
{131}{}{你可以把我当诱饵，自己杀变种人。}
#{132}{}{I have a brahmin as a bait.}
{132}{}{我有一个双头牛作为诱饵。}
#{140}{}{Look, two of us could handle it better. I'll be a bait, and you'll be shooting from afar.}
{140}{}{听着，我们两个能处理得更好。我当诱饵，你从远处开枪。}
#{141}{}{Good thought. But keep in mind - if these creatures start to chew you, I'll just watch the show to the end and go back. I don't want to waste ammunition in vain.}
{141}{}{好主意。但请记住-如果这些生物开始咬你，我只会看节目到最后再回去。我不想白白浪费弹药。}
#{142}{}{Go to the place, I'll arrive after you.}
{142}{}{去那个地方，我会跟在你后面的。}
#{143}{}{I'll tell you when to move. Just stand here for now.}
{143}{}{我告诉你什么时候搬家。现在就站在这里。}
#{144}{}{Don't get distracted, they're somewhere nearby.}
{144}{}{别分心，他们就在附近。}
#{145}{}{You need ammo?}
{145}{}{你需要弹药吗？}
#{146}{}{Good.}
{146}{}{很好。}
#{147}{}{Nicely done. Three corpses - this is the amount Nelson told us about.}
{147}{}{干得好。三具尸体-这是纳尔逊告诉我们的数量。}
#{148}{}{If you have a .30-caliber ammo, then put it in my backpack, it'll be very useful.}
{148}{}{如果你有0.30口径的子弹，放在我的背包里，会很有用的。}
#{149}{}{We talked - and that's enough. I'll go get busy.}
{149}{}{我们谈过了-够了。我要去忙了。}
#{150}{}{I'm just curious about how someone like you ended up in this place.}
{150}{}{我只是好奇像你这样的人怎么会来到这里。}
#{151}{}{Almost by accident. I had to find a quiet place for living. But this is not of your concern.}
{151}{}{几乎是偶然的。我得找个安静的地方住。但这不关你的事。}
#{152}{}{I'll tell you how it is - it's weird. You have good weapons, ammunition, excellent accuracy and a cold calculating mind - and you rot in a half-dead settlement. What's the deal?}
{152}{}{我告诉你怎么回事-很奇怪。你有很好的武器，弹药，出色的准确性和冷静的计算头脑-你在一个半死不活的解决腐烂。怎么回事？}
#{153}{}{I never thought I would meet a detective here. Well, you already guessed that I'm hiding. Someone put a hit on someone, and I took the job. Now I need a quiet place to sit tight. But don't try to fish the details out of me - I won't say anything.}
{153}{}{我从没想过会在这里遇到侦探。你已经猜到我藏起来了。有人袭击了某人，我就接受了这份工作。现在我需要一个安静的地方坐着。但别想从我嘴里套出细节-我什么也不说。}
#{154}{}{You have gained experience for applying the methods of investigation, once again justifying the deserved reputation of a private detective.}
{154}{}{你已经获得了运用调查方法的经验，再次证明了私家侦探应有的声誉。}
#{155}{}{Alright, whatever you say.}
{155}{}{好吧，随你怎么说。}
#{156}{}{Maybe we'd talk about something else?}
{156}{}{也许我们可以谈点别的？}
#{157}{}{You are good with rifles, am I right? And the gun you have here is quite unusual.}
{157}{}{你擅长步枪，对吗？你这里的枪很不寻常。}
#{158}{}{What's your opinion on Nelson?}
{158}{}{你对纳尔逊有什么看法？}
#{159}{}{Why didn't you leave, like everyone else?}
{159}{}{你为什么不和其他人一样离开？}
#{160}{}{An old,, but reliable rifle. I bought it at the Wind of War. They usually keep good weapons for themselves and sell whatever is left. I was lucky to catch one of the best among those that were on the stock. However, this one too has flaws. As for gunner... Yes, I have to count every shot, because bullets aren't cheap. That's how I trained.}
{160}{}{一把旧的，但可靠的步枪。我冒着战争的危险买了它。他们通常为自己保留好武器，把剩下的都卖掉。我很幸运地抓住了存货中最好的一个。然而，这个也有缺陷。至于枪手...是的，我得数一数每一发子弹，因为子弹不便宜。我就是这样训练的。}
#{161}{}{I try to stay away from crazy ones, but this one seems more with the head. At least I see no one better here at organizing stuff.}
{161}{}{我试着远离疯狂的人，但这一个似乎更与头部。至少我觉得这里没有人比我更擅长组织东西。}
#{162}{}{I need a quiet place to live. I do not like big cities.}
{162}{}{我需要一个安静的地方住。我不喜欢大城市。}
#{163}{}{Wind of War? Can you show me where it is?}
{163}{}{战争之风？你能告诉我它在哪里吗？}
#{164}{}{Only if on the map... It's here, in the east, right in the middle of the ruins of the old town.}
{164}{}{只有在地图上...就在这里，在东边，就在古城废墟的中间。}
#{165}{}{Thanks.}
{165}{}{谢谢。}
#{166}{}{I try to stay away from crazy ones, but this one seems more with the head. At least I see no one better at organizing stuff. But is it important now?}
{166}{}{我试着远离疯狂的人，但这一个似乎更与头部。至少我认为没有人比我更擅长组织事情。但现在重要吗？}
#{167}{}{"Flawed" you say. What's the problem?}
{167}{}{你说“有缺陷”。有什么问题吗？}
#{168}{}{Recently, misfires started to happen more often. Probably problems with the shutter. I cleaned my rifle, but it didn't help. Do you understand weapons?}
{168}{}{最近，失火事件开始频繁发生。快门可能有问题。我把枪擦干净了，但没用。你懂武器吗？}
#{169}{}{I have lots of experience in weaponcraft. Let me take a look, I'll try to fix it.}
{169}{}{我在武器方面有很多经验。让我看看，我会试着修好的。}
#{170}{}{If the problem is the mechanics, it is on my part. Just give me a screwdriver and I'll get down to business..}
{170}{}{如果问题出在机械上，那是我的问题。只要给我一把螺丝刀，我就开始干正事了。。}
#{171}{}{Too bad this is not my profile. Let's change the subject.}
{171}{}{可惜这不是我的个人资料。我们换个话题吧。}
#{172}{}{[Disassembling the receiver, you found and fixed the malfunction of the trigger mechanism] Thanks, hope it helps.}
{172}{}{[拆卸接收器，你发现并修复了触发机构的故障]谢谢，希望有帮助。}
#{173}{}{My pleasure. Let's talk about something else.}
{173}{}{我的荣幸。我们再谈点别的吧。}
#{174}{}{You're always welcome. And now I must go.}
{174}{}{随时欢迎你。现在我必须走了。}
#{1153}{}{I never thought I would meet a detective here. Well, you already guessed that I'm hiding. Someone put a hit on someone, and I took the job. Now I need a quiet place to sit tight. But don't try to fish the details out of me - I won't say anything.}
{1153}{}{我从没想过会在这里遇到侦探。你已经猜到我藏起来了。有人袭击了某人，我就接受了这份工作。现在我需要一个安静的地方坐着。但别想从我嘴里套出细节-我什么也不说。}
