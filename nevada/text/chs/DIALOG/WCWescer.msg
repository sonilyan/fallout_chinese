#{100}{}{You see a general.}
{100}{}{你看到一个将军。}
#{101}{}{Attention! It's General Wesker!}
{101}{}{注意！我是韦斯克将军！}
#{110}{}{Civilian?! What do you want?}
{110}{}{平民？！你想要什么？}
#{111}{}{Report!}
{111}{}{报告！}
#{112}{}{I'm going, sir.}
{112}{}{我要走了，先生。}
#{113}{}{I have a complaint about your subordinates.}
{113}{}{我对你的下属有意见。}
#{114}{}{I need to discuss an important question with you.}
{114}{}{我需要和你讨论一个重要的问题。}
#{115}{}{Do you have a job for me?}
{115}{}{你有工作给我吗？}
#{116}{}{I'm listening.}
{116}{}{我在听。}
#{117}{}{Nevermind.}
{117}{}{没有关系。}
#{118}{}{Don't rush your decision. Think about it, my skills and knowledge of the outside world could be useful.}
{118}{}{别急着做决定。想想看，我的技能和对外界的了解可能会有用。}
#{119}{}{Who do you call a greenhorn?! Many of your soldiers could learn a lot from my survival skills.}
{119}{}{你管谁叫新手？！你们很多士兵可以从我的生存技能中学到很多。}
#{120}{}{I don't have any jobs for a greenhorn. Grow up and then we'll talk.}
{120}{}{我没有新手的工作。长大了我们再谈。}
#{121}{}{Let me ask another question then.}
{121}{}{那我再问一个问题。}
#{122}{}{Too bad.}
{122}{}{太糟糕了。}
#{123}{}{Hm... There's one assignment. I don't think it'll be too hard for you.}
{123}{}{嗯...有一个任务。我不认为这对你来说太难。}
#{124}{}{I'm listening.}
{124}{}{我在听。}
#{125}{}{I need a smart person capable to get in Hawthorne Base and bring some things back from there. Interested?}
{125}{}{我需要一个聪明的人，能够进入霍桑基地，从那里带回一些东西。有兴趣吗？}
#{126}{}{Yes! Tell me the details.}
{126}{}{对！告诉我细节。}
#{127}{}{Well, it depends on my risks. How dangerous it is?}
{127}{}{好吧，这取决于我的风险。有多危险？}
#{128}{}{I don't engage myself in such matters. Hire someone else.}
{128}{}{我不参与这种事情。雇佣其他人。}
#{129}{}{Well, if you don't want to risk - I don't need you. Get out.}
{129}{}{好吧，如果你不想冒险-我不需要你。走出。}
#{130}{}{Well okay...}
{130}{}{好吧，好吧...}
#{131}{}{Hawthorne? I don't know such place. What kind of base is it?}
{131}{}{霍桑？我不知道这样的地方。这是什么样的基地？}
#{132}{}{An abandoned military base, not far to the west of New Reno. I'll tell the details if we cooperate. Still interested in this job?}
{132}{}{一个废弃的军事基地，在新雷诺以西不远。如果我们合作的话，我会告诉你细节的。对这份工作还感兴趣吗？}
#{133}{}{Then I have to explain the situation. We are descendants of those who served in Hawthorne more than 70 years ago. Those who knew the secret of our lineage are already feeding the worms. But that's beside the point...}
{133}{}{那我得解释一下情况。我们是70多年前在霍桑服役的人的后代。那些知道我们世系秘密的人已经在喂虫子了。但这不是重点...}
#{134}{}{So...}
{134}{}{所以...}
#{135}{}{There should still be some commemorative evidence of our ancestors left - personal belongings, information in databases, something like that. Collect everything you find and bring it here for a reward. Got any questions?}
{135}{}{应该还有一些我们祖先留下的纪念证据――个人物品，数据库里的信息，诸如此类的东西。把你找到的东西都收集起来，带到这里来作为奖励。有什么问题吗？}
#{136}{}{Yes, I need to know something before I go.}
{136}{}{是的，在我走之前我需要知道一些事情。}
#{137}{}{No more questions, sir.}
{137}{}{没有问题了，先生。}
#{138}{}{Good. I am waiting for good news then. And here's some advice. Hawthorne is still protected by an active automated defense system. Be careful when you enter the garrison territory. Another problem are the raiders which are sometimes found in the vicinity of Hawthorne. These are not ordinary criminals, they carry far better equipment. That's all. Good luck.}
{138}{}{很好。我在等好消息呢。这里有一些建议。霍桑仍然受到主动自动防御系统的保护。当你进入守军领地时要小心。另一个问题是有时在霍桑附近发现的袭击者。他们不是普通的罪犯，他们携带的装备要好得多。这就是全部。祝你好运。}
#{139}{}{[Leave]}
{139}{}{[离开]}
#{140}{}{Why don't you give this assignment to some of your people?}
{140}{}{你为什么不把这个任务交给你的人呢？}
#{141}{}{For starters I don't want to risk my people, it's far simpler for me to hire a scavenger. Secondly they're busy and gathering an expedition is quite troublesome. Finally, not all my people can be trusted with this matter. I need... A person with a slightly different mindset.}
{141}{}{首先，我不想拿我的人冒险，我雇一个拾荒者要简单得多。其次，他们很忙，召集探险队相当麻烦。最后，不是所有我的人都能信任这件事。我需要...心态稍有不同的人。}
#{142}{}{It's all old history. Why do you need it?}
{142}{}{都是过去的事了。你为什么需要它？}
#{143}{}{I expect that some evidence of bygone merits of our ancestors will help lift the spirits of our soldiers. It all depends on what you find.}
{143}{}{我希望我们祖先过去功绩的一些证据将有助于鼓舞我们士兵的精神。这完全取决于你发现了什么。}
#{144}{}{If you ancestors came from Hawthorne, then why are you here and not at the base?}
{144}{}{如果你的祖先来自霍桑，那你为什么在这里而不在基地？}
#{145}{}{I have the same question. They didn't live in the garrison after the Great War, they hid in a nearby vault. Perhaps, Hawthorne were to become the target of nuclear bombs, so staying there would be dangerous. We also couldn't return on base for a number of reasons. Crumbling buildings, working security system, matters of our current settlement and many other ones.}
{145}{}{我也有同样的问题。战后他们没有住在卫戍区，而是躲在附近的一个地下室里。也许霍桑会成为核弹袭击的目标，所以留在那里会很危险。我们也因为一些原因不能回到基地。摇摇欲坠的建筑物，运转中的安全系统，我们现在的定居点和许多其他的问题。}
#{146}{}{What I'll get for this?}
{146}{}{我能得到什么？}
#{147}{}{I'll pay cash. Like me, my word is cast in iron. You can trust the integrity of our deal.}
{147}{}{我付现金。像我一样，我的话是铁铸的。你可以相信我们交易的完整性。}
#{148}{}{Okay, what exactly?}
{148}{}{好吧，具体是什么？}
#{149}{}{}
{149}{}{}
#{150}{}{About the task in Hawthorne.}
{150}{}{关于霍桑的任务。}
#{151}{}{Report, I'm listening.}
{151}{}{报告，我在听。}
#{152}{}{Nothing much, just wanted to clarify something.}
{152}{}{没什么，只是想澄清一下。}
#{153}{}{Still nothing to report.}
{153}{}{还是没什么好报道的。}
#{154}{}{I was able to find a pre-war full dress uniform in Hawthorne.}
{154}{}{我在霍桑找到了一套战前的礼服制服。}
#{155}{}{I was able to find information about your ancestors, a group of deserters who had settled in this place.}
{155}{}{我找到了关于你祖先的信息，一群逃兵在这里定居。}
#{156}{}{Never saw anything like it! If I show up dressed in this uniform on the next flag raising, then I make a desirable effect on my men. This is what I was talking about! Keep it up, private! Uh... I mean, good job, civilian!}
{156}{}{从没见过这样的事！如果我在下一次升旗时穿着这身制服出现，那么我会对我的人产生一种理想的效果。这就是我说的！继续，列兵！Uh...我是说，干得好，平民！}
#{157}{}{Then my part of assignment is done. What about the payment?}
{157}{}{那我的任务就完成了。付款呢？}
#{158}{}{Deserters? Damn it... I thought that the old men were hiding something from us, but this... This information should not leak into the ranks of ordinary people and privates. It seems that there is nothing in the remains of Hawthorne for us. We'll have to sort this out on our own.}
{158}{}{逃兵？该死的...我以为老人们对我们隐瞒了什么，但这...这些信息不应该泄露到普通人和私人的队伍中。看来霍桑的遗骸对我们来说什么都没有。我们得自己解决这个问题。}
#{159}{}{You didn't disappoint, maybe we'll make a real soldier out of you. *chuckles* Here's your money.}
{159}{}{你没有失望，也许我们会让你成为一个真正的士兵。*这是你的钱。}
#{160}{}{Great.}
{160}{}{伟大的。}
#{161}{}{What can be done to boost the spirit of your soldiers?}
{161}{}{怎样才能提高士兵们的精神？}
#{180}{}{Did you know that some of your subordinates attacked one of the Vegas caravans?}
{180}{}{你知道你的下属袭击了维加斯的一个商队吗？}
#{181}{}{I've heard the rumors. I wonder who is spreading this misinformation and why.}
{181}{}{我听说了谣言。我想知道是谁在传播这个错误信息，为什么。}
#{182}{}{Misinformation? So you straight out deny that possibility? I happened to had a chance to visit the site of the attack and found a personal tag of one of your soldiers. What do you say to that?}
{182}{}{误传？所以你直接否认这种可能性？我碰巧有机会参观了袭击现场，发现了你的一名士兵的个人标签。你怎么说？}
#{183}{}{[Pauses] I should have known. My men are not the same as before.}
{183}{}{[停顿]我应该知道的。我的人和以前不一样了。}
#{184}{}{What does it mean? I thought Wind of War was known as a defender of the offended and helpless...}
{184}{}{这是什么意思？我以为战争之风是被冒犯和无助的卫士...}
#{185}{}{It is. But to keep order in our region is hard work. And sometimes the guys need to let off some steam. Apparently, they smelled some easy money to get and succumbed to temptation.}
{185}{}{它是。但是维持我们地区的秩序是一项艰苦的工作。有时候他们需要发泄一下。显然，他们闻到了一些容易得到的钱的味道，并屈服于诱惑。}
#{186}{}{It's not the first time, right? So, your men are gradually turning into raiders?}
{186}{}{这不是第一次，对吧？所以，你的人逐渐变成了袭击者？}
#{187}{}{I have to admit that this is partially true. I try to constrain them, give them more worthy ideas to think of, but the level of motivation and discipline is still falling constantly. This problem appeared not just yesterday.}
{187}{}{我不得不承认这部分是真的。我试图约束他们，给他们更多值得思考的想法，但他们的动机和纪律水平仍在不断下降。这个问题不仅仅出现在昨天。}
#{188}{}{Right. So what about the stolen goods?}
{188}{}{正确的。那赃物呢？}
#{189}{}{Let me see, what I can do about that.}
{189}{}{让我想想，我能做些什么。}
#{190}{}{I'll wait...}
{190}{}{我等着...}
#{191}{}{The boys have split and showed me the stash. Here, that's all they have left, $ 1,500 and some sort of technical device.}
{191}{}{孩子们分开了，给我看了藏匿处。在这里，他们只剩下1500美元和一些技术设备。}
#{192}{}{Well, at least something survived. What are do you going to do with these creeps?}
{192}{}{好吧，至少有些东西幸存了下来。你打算怎么对付这些怪物？}
#{193}{}{Those who committed the robbery will have to answer... Doing hard labor. That will be a good lesson for the others.}
{193}{}{抢劫犯必须回答...做苦工。这对其他人来说将是一个很好的教训。}
#{194}{}{It is good that at least criminals will be punished.}
{194}{}{至少罪犯会受到惩罚，这是好事。}
#{195}{}{Okay, that's your business.}
{195}{}{好吧，那是你的事。}
#{200}{}{You are not an exception.}
{200}{}{你也不例外。}
#{201}{}{However... Looking like you want to beat me up any second, I don't really feel like complaining anymore... [leave]}
{201}{}{然而...看起来你随时都想揍我，我真的不想再抱怨了...[离开]}
#{202}{}{Enough of this! Let's see how you think about things tomorrow. Throw him in the cell!}
{202}{}{够了！让我们看看你明天怎么想。把他扔进牢房！}
#{203}{}{No! Let me go! Not in the prison!}
{203}{}{不！放开我！不是在监狱里！}
#{204}{}{Oh, well then, that explains a lot of things. Thanks for the warning, goodbye.}
{204}{}{哦，那么，这就解释了很多事情。谢谢你的警告，再见。}
#{210}{}{Do you allow your guys to drink alcohol?}
{210}{}{你允许你的人喝酒吗？}
#{211}{}{It's strictly forbidden. For those, who violate the order, awaits some corrective labor.}
{211}{}{这是严格禁止的。对于那些违反命令的人，等待一些矫正劳动。}
#{212}{}{So you have to know this then: Your Quartermaster at the station bought a whole case of alcohol from me! Can you imagine that?}
{212}{}{所以你得知道：你在车站的军需官向我买了一整箱酒！你能想象吗？}
#{213}{}{A case of alcohol? I'll go right now and check that out. If he doesn't have it... You know what I do with false informers?}
{213}{}{一箱酒？我现在就去看看。如果他没有...你知道我怎么对付假线人吗？}
#{214}{}{He got the stock. He tried to explain that it is for resale to caravaneers, but I don't buy this crap. He is punished by couple of days of hard labor. Thank you for your help, we'll take it from here.}
{214}{}{他拿到了股票。他试图解释这是为了转售给商队，但我不相信这些废话。他受到几天苦工的惩罚。谢谢你的帮助，我们从这里开始。}
#{215}{}{Yeah, you're welcome. I didn't do it for personal gain you know, but, for the sake of justice, so to speak... See you, general.}
{215}{}{是的，不客气。我不是为了个人利益，但是，为了正义，可以说...再见，将军。}
#{216}{}{That will not do, because he could have time to dispose of his stock. I don't think I will risk that.}
{216}{}{那不行，因为他有时间处理他的存货。我想我不会冒险的。}
#{217}{}{So be it. I know that the truth is on my side.}
{217}{}{就这样吧。我知道真相在我这边。}
#{218}{}{Ahem... Ahem!}
{218}{}{啊哼...啊哼！}
#{219}{}{What? Ah yes, it's fair to pay for the information, otherwise you may not give me good info in the future. Here's $100.}
{219}{}{什么？啊，是的，这是公平的支付信息，否则你可能不会给我好的信息在未来。这是100美元。}
#{220}{}{Two of your privates attacked and wanted to rob me!}
{220}{}{你的两个士兵袭击了我，想抢劫我！}
#{221}{}{How interesting. I want to hear the details.}
{221}{}{真有趣。我想听听细节。}
#{222}{}{So, it started like this...}
{222}{}{所以，事情是这样开始的...}
#{223}{}{I... Apologize on behalf of the general staff of the Wind of War. Is that enough for you?}
{223}{}{一、 ...代表总参谋部向战争之风道歉。对你来说够了吗？}
#{224}{}{Well... NOPE! You think I'm an idiot!? On your knees! ON YOUR KNEES I SAY!}
{224}{}{好...不！你认为我是个白痴！？跪下！我说跪下！}
#{225}{}{Chief, tell me... You are keepeng a blind eye to the faults of your people, aren't you?}
{225}{}{头儿，告诉我...你对你人民的错误视而不见，是吗？}
#{226}{}{An apology is enough. Not every day it's possible to hear them from such important people.}
{226}{}{道歉就够了。不是每天都能从这么重要的人那里听到。}
#{227}{}{This answer does not satisfy me, but I'll have to settle for it. Bye.}
{227}{}{这个答案我不满意，但我只好接受了。再见。}
#{228}{}{Exactly. It's a hard time for everyone. I need to deal with it.}
{228}{}{确切地。对每个人来说都很艰难。我需要处理它。}
#{229}{}{You see? Your own conduct is the reason for it. Even if the guys were trying to let off some steam - you still don't deserve better treatment.}
{229}{}{你看到了吗？你自己的行为就是原因。即使那些家伙想发泄一下-你还是不应该得到更好的治疗。}
#{230}{}{In fact, you are wrong. I have never touched anyone of them in a lifetime. And then two of them in a row... Ugh... That's hard to bear.}
{230}{}{事实上，你错了。我一辈子都没碰过他们。然后他们两个连在一起...呃...这很难忍受。}
#{231}{}{You are largely mistaken by my account. But I prefer not to talk about myself too much, to prevent a feeling of arrogance.}
{231}{}{我说你大错特错了。但我不喜欢谈论自己太多，以防止一种傲慢的感觉。}
#{232}{}{Yeah-yeah. Even more bullshit.}
{232}{}{是的，是的。更胡说八道。}
#{233}{}{Well, I guess I really need [lowers his voice and says through clenched teeth] to apologize... Usually wastelanders are not worthy of good treatment. They are the same cattle as the rest. Maybe I really made a mistake about you. And maybe not, I'm not to judge. But my guys were doing the wrong thing, so for this - I am sorry.}
{233}{}{嗯，我想我真的需要[压低声音，咬紧牙关说]道歉...通常荒地者不值得好好对待。他们和其他的牛一样。也许我真的弄错你了。也许不是，我不去评判。但是我的人做错了，所以我很抱歉。}
#{234}{}{Oh, those words seem sincere. I accept your apology.}
{234}{}{哦，那些话似乎很真诚。我接受你的道歉。}
#{240}{}{I know that your physician brews some shit for visitors.}
{240}{}{我知道你的医生为来访者酿造了一些狗屎。}
#{241}{}{I had a suspicion that he had some dark business. Now we'll check it. You just wait here. If I find out that you misinformed me... Well, you'll see that I will do.}
{241}{}{我怀疑他有什么阴谋诡计。现在我们来检查一下。你就在这里等着。如果我发现你误导了我...好吧，你会看到我会的。}
#{242}{}{Um, it seems I have no choice...}
{242}{}{嗯，看来我别无选择...}
#{243}{}{We caught that snake! Ha! Now the boys will quiet down. We will destroy the lab as a precedent. Here in Wind of War we do not tolerate drugs. I express to you an official gratitude for providing the information, even though I don't like the spirit of this discovery. You are free to go.}
{243}{}{我们抓住那条蛇了！哈！现在孩子们安静下来。作为先例，我们将摧毁实验室。在战争之风中，我们不能容忍毒品。尽管我不喜欢这个发现的精神，但我还是对你提供的信息表示官方的感谢。你可以走了。}
#{244}{}{That's it? I don't get anything? What a bummer.}
{244}{}{就这样？我什么都没有？真倒霉。}
#{250}{}{That technician from railway station hired killers for my assassination! But they needed to think twice before choosing the wrong target.}
{250}{}{那个火车站的技术员雇了杀手来暗杀我！但在选择错误的目标之前，他们需要三思而后行。}
#{251}{}{What? A poor technician ordered an assassination of a wanderer? If that's some kind of joke, you will go to jail.}
{251}{}{什么？一个可怜的技师下令暗杀一个流浪者？如果那是个玩笑，你会进监狱的。}
#{252}{}{You wish! Your technician is not poor anymore. He's richer than the owner of "Three-card Monte"!}
{252}{}{想得美！你的技师不再穷了。他比“三卡山”的主人还有钱！}
#{253}{}{If one considers that the local mafia... Wait! Is that a hint?}
{253}{}{如果有人认为当地的黑手党...等待！这是暗示吗？}
#{254}{}{No. I bought the pickup from him for a heap of money. A great car, among other things.}
{254}{}{不，我花了一大笔钱从他那儿买了那辆皮卡。一辆好车，还有其他的。}
#{255}{}{Pickup? The one from the garage? He told me he couldn't fix it.}
{255}{}{皮卡？车库里的那个？他告诉我他修不好。}
#{256}{}{He couldn't, until I helped him. The purchase was fair, but when I arrived in Vegas, two grunts with assault rifles were waiting for me there.}
{256}{}{他不能，除非我帮他。购买是公平的，但当我到达维加斯时，两个拿着突击步枪的家伙在那里等我。}
#{257}{}{Are you stupid? Every single street punk would want to cut your throat for that pickup. Why the hell did you decide that it's our technician who sent "killers" after you?}
{257}{}{你傻吗？每一个街头混混都会为了那辆皮卡割断你的喉咙。你为什么认定是我们的技术人员派“杀手”来追你？}
#{258}{}{I have a proof. [Show a receipt from a killer's corpse]}
{258}{}{我有证据。[出示凶手尸体的收据]}
#{259}{}{Well... Who else might do this?!}
{259}{}{好...还有谁会这么做？！}
#{260}{}{Civilian, if you are still *able* to use you brain, remember what I said a minute ago. And if you'll continue... You will be sent to jail for slander. Is that clear?}
{260}{}{平民，如果你还能用脑子，记得我刚才说的话。如果你继续...你将因诽谤罪被送进监狱。明白了吗？}
#{261}{}{Clear. I'll try to find proof.}
{261}{}{清除。我会努力找到证据的。}
#{262}{}{Dammit... That's very bad.}
{262}{}{该死的...那太糟糕了。}
#{263}{}{What, feel ashamed? How do you watch for your men, if they are doing such things?!}
{263}{}{什么，感到羞耻？你怎么看你的人，如果他们做这种事？！}
#{264}{}{Don't be so conceited. You're right, the boys got out of hand. I'm trying to deal with this problem, but so far there are no visible results.}
{264}{}{别那么自负。你说得对，孩子们失控了。我正在努力解决这个问题，但到目前为止还没有明显的结果。}
#{265}{}{And what will do about the technician?}
{265}{}{那技师怎么办？}
#{266}{}{Grrm... I will put him for questioning, issue a warning, make him labor his ass off... And for you - just a bit of advice: to circumvent his shop.}
{266}{}{格瑞...我会审问他，发出警告，让他拼命工作...给你一点建议：绕过他的商店。}
#{267}{}{Is that not a too lenient punishment?}
{267}{}{这不是太轻的惩罚吗？}
#{268}{}{I'm afraid I cannot lose a man so useful for the whole settlement. He maintains the automation and power supply, he repairs weapons, makes ammo... Without him, our settlement will go to hell soon, and a replacement will be very difficult to find. And you... Your problem has been solved, isn't it? So you have nothing to worry about.}
{268}{}{恐怕我不能失去一个对整个定居点如此有用的人。他负责自动化和供电，修理武器，制造弹药...没有他，我们的定居点很快就会下地狱，很难找到替代者。和你...你的问题已经解决了，不是吗？所以你没什么好担心的。}
#{269}{}{What a hell of a disappointment... But as I won't achieve anything with you, I'll go on about my business.}
{269}{}{真让人失望...但既然我和你一事无成，我就继续干我的事。}
#{270}{}{I demand justice! Two of your privates beat up a caravaneer.}
{270}{}{我要求正义！你的两个士兵打了一个商队。}
#{271}{}{That is correct. We have to maintain the law, occasionally - by force. It's all for keeping order.}
{271}{}{这是正确的。我们必须维护法律，偶尔-通过武力。都是为了维持秩序。}
#{272}{}{But he didn't do anything! They just beat him up for no reason!}
{272}{}{但他什么也没做！他们无缘无故地打了他！}
#{273}{}{That's what everyone says. And usually it's a lie. How do I know that the caravaneer is innocent?}
{273}{}{大家都这么说。通常都是谎言。我怎么知道商队的人是无辜的？}
#{274}{}{They took away his handgun and money. Their goals were clear. In the wasteland it's called "robbery".}
{274}{}{他们拿走了他的手枪和钱。他们的目标很明确。在荒地里，这叫“抢劫”。}
#{275}{}{Hmm... We can shake the guys, but if they don't have the gun, *you* will go to jail for insulting my soldiers!}
{275}{}{Hmm...我们可以甩掉那些家伙，但如果他们没有枪，*你*会因为侮辱我的士兵而进监狱的！}
#{276}{}{You know, it's not even my problem, which means also not my responsibility. So long.}
{276}{}{你知道，这甚至不是我的问题，也意味着不是我的责任。这么久。}
#{277}{}{That's fair, let's do it this way. If I'm lying, then I'll go to jail.}
{277}{}{这很公平，让我们这样做吧。如果我撒谎，那我就坐牢。}
#{278}{}{The boys cracked and returned the loot. Here's the gun and $200. But we're not going to apologize.}
{278}{}{男孩们破口大骂并归还了赃物。这是枪和200美元。但我们不会道歉。}
#{279}{}{Why so?!}
{279}{}{为什么？！}
#{280}{}{Think. Try to imagine the reaction of the caravaneers when we'll show up again after what happened.}
{280}{}{想想看。试着想象一下，当我们在事情发生后再次出现时，商队的反应。}
#{281}{}{Hmm, right, it may start a conflict.}
{281}{}{嗯，对，可能会引起冲突。}
#{282}{}{So I ask *you* to convey the money and weapon, along with our apologies.}
{282}{}{所以我请你把钱和武器连同我们的道歉一起转达给我。}
#{283}{}{Well, in that case...}
{283}{}{好吧，那样的话...}
#{284}{}{So, that's it, the guy was still armed? A shady business, huh?}
{284}{}{就这样，那家伙还带着枪？不正当的生意，是吗？}
#{285}{}{Um, actually... Now I understand why you are avoiding any proceedings. Maybe I can convince you in the future. Or not. Let's talk about it later.}
{285}{}{呃，实际上...现在我明白你为什么回避诉讼了。也许将来我能说服你。不管怎样。我们以后再谈吧。}
#{290}{}{Did you know someone at the station is involved in espionage?}
{290}{}{你知道车站有人参与间谍活动吗？}
#{291}{}{Is that so?}
{291}{}{是这样吗？}
#{292}{}{He has asked me to copy the data on the patrol radio frequencies. I hope this information will help you?}
{292}{}{他让我复制巡逻无线电频率上的数据。我希望这些信息能对你有所帮助？}
#{293}{}{This information would *really* help us... But you have to play along, so we are sure that you're not lying.}
{293}{}{这些信息真的会帮助我们...但你必须配合，所以我们确信你没有撒谎。}
#{294}{}{Err... Of course...}
{294}{}{呃...当然...}
#{295}{}{Thanks for the help. My people will appreciate your deed, but don't think too much about it.}
{295}{}{谢谢你的帮助。我的人民会感激你的行为，但不要想太多。}
#{296}{}{Very well, but what was this guy shouting when you were tying him? Something about revenge for his brethren...}
{296}{}{很好，但你绑他的时候他在喊什么？关于为他兄弟报仇的事...}
#{297}{}{Certainly, no problem.}
{297}{}{当然，没问题。}
#{298}{}{I do not know exactly how my men offended him, but there were cases when our troops were unable to protect settlements in need against aggressors. Some fell victim to raiders, others were captured by slavers. We can't take care of the whole region! The resource and manpower demand for the maintenance of outposts and organizing patrols is too heavy.}
{298}{}{我不知道我的部下究竟是怎么得罪他的，但有时我们的部队无法保护有需要的定居点免受侵略者的攻击。一些人成为袭击者的牺牲品，另一些人被奴隶贩子俘虏。我们不能照顾整个地区！前哨维护和组织巡逻的资源和人力需求太大。}
#{299}{}{So, you did all you could? Well, in any case, it will remain on your conscience. Goodbye.}
{299}{}{你已经尽力了？好吧，不管怎样，这都是你的良心问题。再见。}
#{300}{}{}
{300}{}{}
#{301}{}{}
{301}{}{}
#{302}{}{Deal.}
{302}{}{处理。}
#{303}{}{My answer is NO!}
{303}{}{我的回答是不！}
#{304}{}{Lift!}
{304}{}{举起来！}
#{305}{}{Sorry, sir! Yes, sir!}
{305}{}{对不起，先生！是的，先生！}
#{306}{}{I can sell heavy machine gun ammunition from Hawthorne.}
{306}{}{我可以卖霍桑的重机枪弹药。}
#{307}{}{That is our caliber! These bullets were meant for heavy machine guns from a small speedboat fleet. We got a couple of them, dragged them from Hawthorne a few years ago. Now we can load them. An excellent find! I will buy a box for $ 750.}
{307}{}{这是我们的口径！这些子弹是为小型快艇舰队的重机枪准备的。我们有几个，几年前从霍桑拖过来的。现在我们可以装了。一个极好的发现！我要花750美元买一盒。}
#{308}{}{In Hawthorne I managed to find an ceremonial gun. It looks impressive...}
{308}{}{我在霍桑找到了一把礼炮。它看起来令人印象深刻...}
#{309}{}{Well, let's take a look... Wait, that's the personal sidearm of my ancestor! The man who saved our people during the Great War. And here I am, holding a piece of his past, a certificate of deeds long forgotten. I will buy this weapon for $ 1,000.}
{309}{}{好吧，让我们看看...等等，那是我祖先的私人武器！那个在大战中拯救我们人民的人。我就在这里，手里拿着他的一段往事，一份早已被遗忘的事迹证明。我要花1000美元买这个武器。}
#{320}{}{I am an official representative from Salt Lake City's Nuka-Cola factory and I have a mutually beneficial offer for you.}
{320}{}{我是盐湖城努卡可乐厂的官方代表，我有一个互惠互利的提议。}
#{321}{}{We have a quartermaster at the entrance. You should resolve such questions with him.}
{321}{}{入口处有个军需官。你应该和他一起解决这些问题。}
#{322}{}{A trader in the old station? Okay, I'll talk to him.}
{322}{}{旧车站的商人？好的，我会和他谈谈。}
#{323}{}{He said he wouldn't commit such deals without your permission.}
{323}{}{他说没有你的允许他不会做这种交易。}
#{324}{}{And he did the right thing. Where is the guarantee that you are who you're representing? And how can we trust you?}
{324}{}{他做了正确的事。你是谁的保证在哪里？我们怎么能相信你？}
#{325}{}{In that case my license can convince you.}
{325}{}{那样的话，我的驾照可以说服你。}
#{326}{}{You're not welcoming to such rare trade partners. Your loss...}
{326}{}{你不欢迎这种罕见的贸易伙伴。你的损失...}
#{327}{}{...And no one knows where did you get that. Prove yourself that you can be trusted. As for paper, there are better uses for them at the toilet.}
{327}{}{…没人知道你从哪儿弄来的。证明你自己是可以信任的。至于纸，它们在厕所里有更好的用途。}
#{328}{}{Hmm, you don't look like a charlatan. At least your actions say otherwise. I think we can give you a chance. I will contact the quartermaster by  radio, and you go and talk to him about the details of the deal.}
{328}{}{嗯，你看起来不像江湖骗子。至少你的行为说明了这一点。我想我们可以给你一个机会。我会用无线电联系军需官，你去和他谈谈交易的细节。}
#{329}{}{Yes, sir!}
{329}{}{是的，先生！}
#{330}{}{Wait, let me explain it for you using my figures and diagrams....}
{330}{}{等等，让我用我的图表给你解释一下...。}
#{331}{}{[listens carefully and looks interested] Hmm, talented traders are rare to be seen nowadays, I don't want to miss a profitable partner, whoever he is... I think we will give you a chance. I'll contact the quartermaster by the radio, and you go and talk to him about the details of the deal.}
{331}{}{[仔细听，看起来很感兴趣]嗯，现在很少见到有才华的交易员，我不想错过一个有利可图的合伙人，不管他是谁...我想我们会给你一个机会。我会用无线电联系军需官，你去和他谈谈交易的细节。}
#{400}{}{Wait a minute. I have a further request, if you do not mind.}
{400}{}{等一下。如果你不介意的话，我还有一个要求。}
#{401}{}{Yes?}
{401}{}{对？}
#{402}{}{I got reports about a couple of rednecks making some fuss at the checkpoint. But the reports have some issues, so I could use your help to clarify the situation.}
{402}{}{我接到报告说有几个乡巴佬在检查站大惊小怪。但是报告有一些问题，所以我可以请你帮忙澄清情况。}
#{403}{}{I will be glad to help you. What should I do?}
{403}{}{我很乐意帮助你。我该怎么办？}
#{404}{}{You know, scavengers like me don't know the word "help". Goodbye.}
{404}{}{你知道，像我这样的拾荒者不知道“帮助”这个词。再见。}
#{405}{}{I would be glad to help, but I've got to leave this place, too much trouble here. You will somehow sort things out without me.}
{405}{}{我很乐意帮忙，但我得离开这里，这里太麻烦了。你不用我也能解决问题。}
#{406}{}{Talk with the guards at the checkpoint, then go down to the station and find those rednecks who stirred up everything. Talk to them, find out their version of the incident. They'll be more willing to talk with you than with military of the garrison.}
{406}{}{和检查站的警卫谈一谈，然后到车站去找那些捣乱一切的乡巴佬。和他们谈谈，找出他们对事件的看法。他们更愿意和你谈话，而不是和驻军的军队。}
#{407}{}{Sounds easy.}
{407}{}{听起来很简单。}
#{408}{}{I look forward to the report. The guards will help you.}
{408}{}{我期待着这份报告。卫兵会帮你的。}
#{409}{}{[Leave]}
{409}{}{[离开]}
#{410}{}{Regarding the incident at the checkpoint.}
{410}{}{关于检查站的事件。}
#{411}{}{So, what happened?}
{411}{}{那么，发生了什么？}
#{412}{}{Funny story. It turned out, Private Derren committed intercourse with the redneck's daughter while collecting taxes. Father came here for justice and was denied to enter.}
{412}{}{有趣的故事。原来，二等兵德伦在收税的时候和雷德内克的女儿发生了性关系。父亲来这里讨公道，却被拒绝进入。}
#{413}{}{Can't say exactly. These rednecks have gone back to the village, and the guards don't care about them.}
{413}{}{不能确切地说。这些乡巴佬已经回村里去了，卫兵根本不关心他们。}
#{414}{}{I'm afraid it's impossible to figure out. Because at the station was a commotion among newcomers. And the rednecks happened to be in the firing line.}
{414}{}{恐怕不可能搞清楚。因为在车站，新来的人骚动起来。而红人正好在射击线上。}
#{415}{}{I still have not managed to find out the details. I'll be back when I hear anything.}
{415}{}{我还没弄清楚细节。有消息我会回来的。}
#{416}{}{Okay, I believe you. In any case, I am glad that I wasn't disappointed in my men once again.}
{416}{}{好吧，我相信你。无论如何，我很高兴我没有再次对我的人失望。}
#{417}{}{Yes, that's alright.}
{417}{}{是的，没关系。}
#{418}{}{Private Derren is a good guy. It's strange that he got into such situation. However, it can be easily understood, since very few women live in the garrison. If he had a "crush" on the village girl, it's not a bad thing itself. Tell me, is she still at the station?}
{418}{}{二等兵德伦是个好人。奇怪的是他陷入了这样的境地。不过，这很容易理解，因为驻军里很少有妇女。如果他“迷恋”了村里的女孩，本身也不是坏事。告诉我，她还在车站吗？}
#{419}{}{I'm afraid not.}
{419}{}{恐怕不行。}
#{420}{}{Yes, she is still there with her dad.}
{420}{}{是的，她仍然和她爸爸在一起。}
#{421}{}{It's a pity. I could give him and the rest of the men an indicative hearing as a lesson. But have to confine with some explanatory conversation. Thank you for your intelligence on the matter.}
{421}{}{真遗憾。我可以给他和其他人一个指示性的听证会作为教训。但必须限于一些解释性的谈话。谢谢你在这件事上的情报。}
#{422}{}{You're welcome.}
{422}{}{不客气。}
#{423}{}{Perhaps the old man hoped that he would be able to send his daughter to the garrison. I don't think that my people would be pleased by that. But this is exactly what I need! *I* will make Derren marry her and take the girl to live with him. This will be an example to others and should make soldiers to treat people of the wasteland better. Thanks for the help.}
{423}{}{也许老人希望能把女儿送到卫戍区去。我不认为我的人民会对此感到高兴。但这正是我需要的！*我会让德伦娶她，然后带着这个女孩和他一起住。这将是其他人的榜样，应该使士兵更好地对待荒地人民。谢谢你的帮助。}
#{424}{}{Take the 100 bucks for what I made you run around. Don't hurry to leave, your continued assistance in external relations would be very useful.}
{424}{}{我让你到处乱跑，你就拿这100块吧。别急着走，你在对外关系上继续提供帮助会很有用的。}
#{425}{}{What I need to do?}
{425}{}{我需要做什么？}
#{426}{}{Thank you, but I must continue my journey. I can't stay here for long. Goodbye.}
{426}{}{谢谢，但我必须继续我的旅程。我不能在这里呆太久。再见。}
#{427}{}{We have problems with the meat supply from one of the farmers. There is a reason to believe that farmer just doesn't trust us. It can be understood, given the reputation of the garrison. We need your help to restore confidence in us and re-establish contact with the farmer. Speak to the quartermaster, if you'll decide to take the job.}
{427}{}{我们有一个农民的肉供应问题。有理由相信农夫就是不信任我们。可以理解，考虑到驻军的声誉。我们需要你的帮助，以恢复对我们的信心，并重新建立与农民的联系。如果你决定接受这份工作，就和军需官谈谈。}
#{428}{}{I'll talk to him.}
{428}{}{我会和他谈谈。}
#{429}{}{Take the 100 bucks for making you run around. Sorry to see you leave, your assistance would be useful in external relations. But so far I have no more assignment for you. Farewell.}
{429}{}{拿100块钱让你到处乱跑。很抱歉看到你离开，你的帮助在对外关系中是有用的。但到目前为止我没有更多的任务给你。再会。}
#{500}{}{It has become known to me that the nearby vault is crawling with mutants. I could deal with that.}
{500}{}{据我所知，附近的避难所里爬满了变种人。我能应付的。}
#{501}{}{Hmm. So, our operators are chitchatting again... Although, such situation is indeed the reason of our concern. I wouldn't take risks of dispatching my people, but if you know the location and willing to do everything by yourself - you're welcome to try. Report to me if it's done.}
{501}{}{嗯。所以，我们的接线员又在聊天了...尽管如此，这种情况确实是我们关注的原因。我不会冒险派遣我的人，但如果你知道的位置，并愿意自己做的一切-欢迎你尝试。完成后向我汇报。}
#{502}{}{I had a change of plans. Deal with it yourself.}
{502}{}{我改变了计划。你自己处理吧。}
#{503}{}{Good, I'll come by later.}
{503}{}{很好，我一会儿过来。}
#{504}{}{The mutants are all dead. They won't be a problem anymore.}
{504}{}{变种人都死了。他们不再是问题了。}
#{505}{}{Our patrols are already confirmed that. Now we could fix the place up and find some usage for it... Oh, and here's your reward [hands you 2000$].}
{505}{}{我们的巡逻队已经证实了这一点。现在我们可以把这个地方修好并找到一些用途...哦，这是你的报酬[给你2000美元]。}
#{506}{}{Glad to help.}
{506}{}{很乐意帮忙。}
#{507}{}{You cound not be so cheap at least for once...}
{507}{}{你不能这么便宜至少一次...}
#{1202}{}{Enough of this! Let's see how you think about things tomorrow. Throw her in the cell!}
{1202}{}{够了！让我们看看你明天怎么想。把她扔进牢房！}
#{1230}{}{In fact, you are wrong. I have never touched anyone of them in a lifetime. And then two of them in a row... Ugh... That's hard to bear.}
{1230}{}{事实上，你错了。我一辈子都没碰过他们。然后他们两个连在一起...呃...这很难忍受。}
#{1251}{}{What? A poor technician ordered an assassination of a wanderer? If that's some kind of joke, you will go to jail.}
{1251}{}{什么？一个可怜的技师下令暗杀一个流浪者？如果那是个玩笑，你会进监狱的。}
#{1254}{}{No. I bought the pickup from him for a heap of money. A great car, among other things.}
{1254}{}{不，我花了一大笔钱从他那儿买了那辆皮卡。一辆好车，还有其他的。}
#{1256}{}{He didn't until I helped him. The purchase was fair, but when I arrived in Vegas two grunts with assault rifles waited for me.}
{1256}{}{直到我帮助他，他才知道。购买是公平的，但当我到达维加斯时，两个拿着突击步枪的家伙在等我。}
#{1257}{}{Are you stupid? Every single street punk will want to cut your throat for that pickup. Why the fuck you decided that it's our technician who sent "killers" after you?}
{1257}{}{你傻吗？每一个街头混混都会为了那辆皮卡割你的喉咙。你他妈的为什么认定是我们的技术人员派“杀手”来追你？}
#{1260}{}{Civilian, if you still are *able* to use you brain, remember what I said a minute ago. And if you continue... You will be sent to jail for slander. Is that clear?}
{1260}{}{平民，如果你还能用脑子，记得我刚才说的话。如果你继续...你将因诽谤罪被送进监狱。明白了吗？}
#{1324}{}{And he did the right thing. Where is the guarantee that you are who you're representing? And how can we trust you?}
{1324}{}{他做了正确的事。你是谁的保证在哪里？我们怎么能相信你？}
#{1403}{}{I will be glad to help you. What should I do?}
{1403}{}{我很乐意帮助你。我该怎么办？}
#{1405}{}{I would be glad to help, but I've got to leave this place, too much unspend testosterone. You will somehow sort things out without me.}
{1405}{}{我很乐意帮忙，但我得离开这个地方，太多没用的睾丸激素了。你不用我也能解决问题。}
#{5004}{}{The mutants are all dead. They won't be a problem anymore.}
{5004}{}{变种人都死了。他们不再是问题了。}
#{5006}{}{Glad to help.}
{5006}{}{很乐意帮忙。}
