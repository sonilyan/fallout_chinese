{100}{}{Hello, can I help you with something?}
{101}{}{Who are you?}
{102}{}{What is this place?}
{103}{}{Actually I don't have time for this, goodbye.}
#
{104}{}{Welcome back stranger, something else you wanted?}
#who are you?
{105}{}{I'm Brian, chief of security here. Have you come for the job?}
{106}{}{Nope, what job are you talking about?}
{107}{}{Sorry, not interested. Let me ask you something else.}
#nope, what...?
{108}{}{I have put a notice on the bulletin board, that we need someone skilled with guns.}
{109}{}{What for?}
#
{110}{}{There are some serious issues. We got many problems inside the administration. One of them is security.
 Since all the money we make is spent on repairs and maintenance, there's very little left to pay for guards. People just
 walk away and don't want to work for us anymore.}
{111}{}{So, how is that affecting your business here?}
#
{112}{}{There are always bandits, raiders... And they all want the same thing... Since we lost so many people, our
 defenses are very weak. We can't hold those attacks anymore so we decided to force it while we still have
 strength.}
{113}{}{So, what's the plan?}
#
{114}{}{It's very simple. This is our land and they will play by our rules. We're going to tighten our position here,
 secure all entrances to this power plant. They're itching to attack, which may very well occur sooner
 than later. I'm not sure when... but I can feel something is going to happen very soon.}
{115}{}{What about those people in the city? They are the plant workers, are they safe?}
#
{116}{}{I can assure you they are. Bandits were never interested in them because we give them food and clothes,
 but no money. So practically there's nothing to steal from them. And besides that, all of our workers live and work at
 the plant which is in the underground facility complex.}
{117}{}{I'm not sure I understand you...?}
#
{118}{}{You will have a chance if we succeed. Now, we have a more important matter to discuss. Tell me, what do
 you think about helping us in exchange for some money and supplies?}
{119}{}{How much money are we talking about?}
{120}{}{I don't like this at all. I'll be going now.}
#how much money?
{121}{}{Say about $1000.}
{122}{}{OK, I'm in.}
{123}{}{Could you raise that amount? I'm supposed to be shoot at.}
#i'm in.
{124}{}{Excellent, I'm glad I have you with us. After we finish our operation your money will be waiting here. Once
 you are ready, report to me.}
{125}{}{I think I'm ready now.}
{126}{}{I'll be back when I'm ready.}
#Raise...
{127}{}{Risk is part of the job. So... no, I make the rules! Take it or leave it.}
{128}{}{I'll take it.}
{129}{}{Forget it, I'm gone.}
#Back and job not taken... or not ready yet.
{130}{}{Just say what's on your mind.}
{131}{}{About that job?}
{132}{}{Nothing at the moment.}
#
{133}{}{Have you changed your mind?}
#this place...
{134}{}{This is Duntown's power plant. With our little reactor we are powering several areas around Duntown.
 We are also exporting uranium ore for similar types of reactors and some other types of generators designed to use this
 kind of fuel.}
{135}{}{How can one procure some uranium?}
{136}{}{You said you have a nuclear reactor, it must be very small to fit in that room.}
{137}{}{Interesting, let me ask you something else.}
# how does one can get uranium...
{138}{}{There's a procedure for that. I'm too busy right now to tell you all the details. Talk to Leonard in the
 administration building. He's in charge of the administrative work, so he could help you. The administration building
 is just north from here.}
{139}{}{Thanks. There's something else I wanted to ask you.}
#reactor very small...
{140}{}{I thought you would ask about that. Well, the reactor is actually underground. For safety reasons I can tell you
 only that.}
{141}{}{That makes sense, thanks for the info.}
#posao uzet...
{142}{}{We must wait now. They could attack any second, so prepare yourself!}
{143}{}{I'm ready for this.}
#
{144}{}{We did it! You really got skills and could be very valuable to us. You earned this... There's a locker with your
 reward. I really could use your presence here, but first you deserve to know things about us. Here's a key which will
 give you access to the lower levels. There you will find any answers you seek. }
{145}{}{Thanks.}
#
{146}{}{Keep that key with you all the time. And by the way... if somebody asks, you are a new worker here, OK?}
{147}{}{Sure thing, thanks again.}
#
{148}{}{Hello again, how are things going with you?}
{149}{}{Fine, thanks.}
#dude touch Brian's locker
{150}{}{Don't touch that!}
{151}{}{What are you doing!?}
{152}{}{Leave that locker alone!}
#
{153}{}{Hello there, something you wanted?}
{154}{}{I think I found the cause of your financial problems.}
{155}{}{Nothing at the moment.}
#
{156}{}{So, what have you got?}
{157}{}{I found this account book with some things you might be interested in, here you go. [You hand him the book.]}
#
{158}{}{Let me see... [Reading the book.] Hah, I knew it. I knew there was something wrong with those bills...
 But, who would do such a thing. Maybe someone with an outside connection...}
{159}{}{And who might that be?}
#
{160}{}{I have no idea. I will need at least one day to analyze this book. It's best if you come back tomorrow. We must
 expose the person responsible for this as soon as possible, before he causes more trouble.}
{161}{}{OK, see you tomorrow then.}
#
{162}{}{I'm not finished yet, I need more time.}
{163}{}{I'll leave you to it.}
#
{164}{}{You're here just on time. I have finished studying those accounts... And everything points to one man... Damn,
 this is harder than I thought it would be.}
{165}{}{What's wrong?}
#
{166}{}{The accountant in charge during the time those accounts were written, was Mr. Charles. Unfortunately he died
 under mysterious circumstances about a year ago. And if you want to know who got his job afterwards, the answer is
 nobody did.}
{167}{}{Why is that?}
#
{168}{}{Because of the financial situation that took place again... However, something else draw my attention.
 There's a possibility that somebody else was involved because there's a different handwriting on a few pages...}
{169}{}{So, what are you going to do?}
#
{170}{}{It looks like we have to find this person or there could be more of them. Are you with me?}
{171}{}{Yes.}
{172}{}{Not just yet.}
#yes...
{173}{}{Good. The best thing now is that you start your search here. I have my suspicions about one person,
 Christopher. He's the cleaning guy, but I never managed to find the whole truth about him. It also seems like some
 people are protecting him, don't really know why... That means you must act as a new guy and find out whatever you
 can. Our time is short... And keep me informed.}
{174}{}{Sure thing, Brian.}
#
{175}{}{You are here, so did you find out anything?}
{176}{}{I have spoken to Christopher and it looks like he murdered Charles and took the money that Charles stole
 from you. And there's also something about him... I don't know how to tell you...}
{177}{}{Nothing yet.}
#after line 190
{178}{}{That bastard... And still he is stealing money from me. But selling drugs to my workers... That's a more
 serious crime. He's going to pay for all of this. And Charles... He was a good man. Did you find any of that money
 which he had stolen?}
{179}{}{Unfortunately, there's a little problem. You see, he's dead. He killed himself before I could find out anything.
 I'm sorry.}
#
{180}{}{Well, I feel pity only because I haven't shoot him myself. Nevertheless, the fool is dead, he got what he
 deserved. Thank you for your services. Here's some money for your trouble. That was some great service, stranger.
 You are welcome here at any time, and stay as long as you like.}
{181}{}{Thanks. I'll be off then.}
#
{182}{}{Is there some reward for the job?}
#reward...
{183}{}{Of course. I always respect and reward fair work. After the job is done, we'll talk about your reward.}
{184}{}{OK, I'm in.}
{185}{}{I'll be back when I'm ready.}
#
{186}{}{You're back, are you going to help me with this?}
#
{187}{}{Welcome back stranger, how's it going?}
{188}{}{OK, I'll be going now.}
#added 22.11.05... answer to line 176
{189}{}{Tell me what you know... There's nothing more disastrous than all this mess he brought upon us all.}
{190}{}{You're right about that... He sold drugs to the workers, so many of them became addicted that he was actually
 making a lot of money...}
#
{191}{}{As chief of security, haven't you noticed anything unusual, like a major radiation leak on the third level?}
#
{192}{}{I don't know anything about a leak. That level was deemed off limits a long time ago. Besides, my focus is up
 here where the real danger is. Still, the safety of the people working here IS my concern, as such it would help if you'd
 stay away from that level, it would make my job a lot easier.}
{193}{}{Is there anything you can do about it?}
{194}{}{Who would be in charge of this matter?}
{195}{}{Why don't you send someone to fix the problem?}
{196}{}{Gee, that's good advice, thanks.}
#193, 194, 195... gvar19->2
{197}{}{We don't have the equipment to deal with it. And personally, I won't risk any lives until our hand is forced.
 Look, I don't have all the answers, Leonard is the one you should be talking to. If he decides to do something about it,
 then we can talk some more.}
{198}{}{You're so incompetent and full of crap! You don't care at all!} #triggers hostility
{199}{}{Alright, I guess we'll see each other later.}
