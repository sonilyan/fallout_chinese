{100}{}{Can you spare any bullets?}
{101}{}{Where did you come from?}
{102}{}{Can you help us?}
{103}{}{Talk to our leader, not me.}
{104}{}{I can't talk to you.}
{105}{}{Bother somebody else, okay?!}
#
{106}{}{You're the man!}
{107}{}{My thanks to you, stranger.}
{108}{}{Now we can breathe easier.}
{109}{}{I'm just fine here, thanks.}
#
{110}{}{You bitch!}
{111}{}{Go back to your mommy!}
{112}{}{No, I'm not the damn boss!}
{113}{}{What a stupid...}
{114}{}{Get outta here!}
{115}{}{You heard me!}
#
{116}{}{Is there any beer for me?}
{117}{}{This place sucks.}
{118}{}{We are hiding in this cave like rats.}
{119}{}{Just like the old days.}
{120}{}{If only I had some Nukas.}
{121}{}{When are we going to get out of this place?}
{122}{}{I wish I knew what's going on here.}
{123}{}{This sure isn't what I signed up for.}
{124}{}{Iguana on a stick, that's tasty.}
{125}{}{Somebody close the fridge, please... Coincidentally, do we have a fridge?!}
{126}{}{I just stand here, I don't get to do anything.}
