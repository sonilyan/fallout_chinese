#{124}{}{Uh... [she gives you a quizzical look] ...you don't know? Listen, hire my girls and you can find out. Actions speak louder than words, yeah?}
{124}{}{Uh...[她疑惑地看了你一眼]…你不知道？听着，雇我的女儿，你会发现的。行动胜于雄辩，是吗？}
#{125}{}{Is it... Safe?}
{125}{}{它是...安全吗？}
#{126}{}{Oh yeah, yeah! Of course! Perfectly safe... The same-sex option is the safest... Anyway, I'm not talking about that whores near the nightclub. Gonna catch something nasty with those girls.}

#{136}{}{Locals know we're the best in the city. It's a status thing, really, to come here. And out-of-towners, well, they need someone that'll treat them right after a long journey. But you know, it's core, it's just the way people are. *Everybody* wants what we're selling. It's just human instinct.}
{136}{}{当地人知道我们是城里最好的。来这里真的是一种地位。外地人，嗯，他们需要一个在长途旅行后马上治疗他们的人。但你知道，这是核心，这只是人们的方式。*每个人都想要我们卖的东西。这只是人类的本能。}

{151}{}{[她的微笑消失]真的吗？以前这里很好，直到那些混蛋搬进来。粗暴对待我的女儿，威胁我-我！我先来的！你应该让他们知道这条街真正的主人是谁。}

{157}{}{我认识其中一个男孩...他叫臭灰熊。我不知道他们是不是本地人，但他们最近开始在这里闲逛。他们觉得自己是个混蛋...他们根本不知道自己干了什么。}
#{158}{}{Do you really care? Did Mr. Thompson send you to deal with this problem or to just ask a lot of stupid questions?}
{158}{}{你真的在乎吗？汤普森先生派你来是为了解决这个问题还是只是问了很多愚蠢的问题？}
#{159}{}{I don't care what you do to them, I just don't want to see them interrupting with my business anymore.}
{159}{}{我不在乎你对他们做了什么，我只是不想再看到他们打断我的生意。}
#{160}{}{[She smirks] Oh, let me guess. He didn't pay you, huh? And he's not going to, is he? Damn, a sucker really is born every minute! I pay him weekly for protection, right on time, and when I finally need him he sends an idiot like you. Why am I not surprised? Listen, if you want to make some money, don't try to shake me down. Grow a spine and do your fucking *job* instead!}
{160}{}{哦，让我猜猜。他没付钱给你，嗯？他不会的，是吗？该死的，一个笨蛋真的每分钟都在生！我每周付他一次保护费，准时，当我终于需要他时，他就派你这样的白痴来。为什么我不感到惊讶？听着，如果你想赚点钱，别想吓唬我。长一根脊梁，做你他妈的工作！}

{163}{}{我是解决这个问题的人。我来决定什么信息重要与否。}
#{164}{}{Yeah? Fine, I'll tell you what I think. They probably thought they could take some territory for themselves while all the big boys are fighting. Fucking stupid. But I guess they don't know how things work around here, since I've never seen them in the neighborhood before this.}
{164}{}{是 啊？好吧，我告诉你我的想法。他们可能认为，当所有的大男孩都在战斗时，他们可以为自己占领一些领地。他妈的蠢。但我猜他们不知道这里的情况，因为我以前从没在附近见过他们。}
#{165}{}{I've solved your problem.}
{165}{}{我已经解决了你的问题。}
#{166}{}{Already? I guess you're good for something after all. Tell Thompson I'm pleased with your work.}
