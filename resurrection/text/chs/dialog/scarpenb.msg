#{100}{}{You see a man.}
{100}{}{你看到一个男人。}
#{150}{}{You see Bruce Carpenter.}
{150}{}{你看到布鲁斯・卡彭特了。}
#{200}{}{You see a somber-looking man.}
{200}{}{你看到一个面色阴沉的人。}
#{250}{}{You see Bruce Carpenter, the sheriff of Sedit.}
{250}{}{你看到布鲁斯・卡彭特，塞迪特的警长。}
#{300}{}{How did that thief get in here?! Someone's gonna pay for this!}
{300}{}{那个小偷怎么进来的？！有人会为此付出代价的！}
#{500}{}{Everybody's damn incompetent here! They allowed my own son to be kidnapped! And that good-for-nothing Jeffrey is trying to make up for it by bringing me some damn vagabond?!}
{500}{}{每个人都他妈的不称职！他们允许我的儿子被绑架！杰弗里想给我带些该死的流浪汉来弥补这一切？！}
#{501}{}{What actually happened?}
{501}{}{到底发生了什么？}
#{550}{}{What happened? You want to know what happened?! Some bastard kidnapped David. My only son! In broad daylight! That's what happened! He was just playing in the garden and all of a sudden he's gone! His nanny was supposed to watch him! That damned woman! I don't believe a word she says, I'll have someone flog her! All those incompetent guards will pay for this!}
{550}{}{发生什么事了？你想知道发生了什么？！有个混蛋绑架了大卫。我唯一的儿子！光天化日之下！事情就是这样！他刚才在花园里玩，突然就走了！他的保姆应该看着他！那个该死的女人！她说的话我一个字都不信，我要找人揍她！所有那些不称职的警卫都会为此付出代价的！}
#{551}{}{Just take it easy. I'll try to help you.}
{551}{}{别紧张。我会尽力帮助你的。}
#{600}{}{I can't take it easy when I don't know where David is! How can YOU possibly help me? The whole damn police of Sedit will go after the kidnappers! It's about time that slacker Morrow started doin' something useful!}
{600}{}{当我不知道大卫在哪里的时候，我不能放松！你怎么可能帮我？整个塞迪特该死的警察会去追绑匪的！懒鬼莫罗该做点有用的事了！}
#{601}{}{I'm sure the kidnappers are counting on that. Searching the whole town would be too obvious, it could put your son in danger. With your permission, I would like to try and find David using discreet investigation.}
{601}{}{我相信绑匪们都指望着这一点。搜遍全城太明显了，会把你儿子置于危险之中。如果你允许，我想通过谨慎的调查找到大卫。}
#{602}{}{I'm sure the kidnappers are counting on that. Searching the whole town would be too obvious, it could put your son in danger. With your permission, I would like to try and find David using discreet investigation.}
{602}{}{我相信绑匪们都指望着这一点。搜遍全城太明显了，会把你儿子置于危险之中。如果你允许，我想通过谨慎的调查找到大卫。}
#{650}{}{Do whatever you want. If you find and save David, I'll make a disgustingly rich man out of you. But remember one thing: If anything happens to him, and I mean any little thing, you'll wish you've never met me. Is that clear?!}
{650}{}{你想干什么就干什么。如果你找到并救了大卫，我会让你变成一个恶心的有钱人。但请记住一件事：如果他出了什么事，我指的是任何小事，你都会希望你从未见过我。明白了吗？！}
#{651}{}{Yes, sir.}
{651}{}{是的，先生。}
#{652}{}{If that is the case, I have no interest in trying to find your son.}
{652}{}{如果是这样的话，我没有兴趣去找你儿子。}
#{700}{}{So what are you still doing here?! Just robbing me of my time. My son's life's at stake! Get out of here!}
{700}{}{你还在这里干嘛？！只是抢了我的时间。我儿子的生命危在旦夕！离开这里！}
#{701}{}{Bye.}
{701}{}{再见。}
#{750}{}{You can interrogate anyone you want. I'll tell Jeffrey to let you in at any time. You can also come to inform me if you find out anything.}
{750}{}{你可以审问任何你想审问的人。我会告诉杰弗里让你随时进来。如果你发现什么，也可以来通知我。}
#{751}{}{OK.}
{751}{}{好 啊。}
#{800}{}{Everybody's damn incompetent here! They allowed my own son to be kidnapped! And that good-for-nothing Jeffrey is trying to make up for it by bringing me some damn vagabond?!}
{800}{}{每个人都他妈的不称职！他们允许我的儿子被绑架！杰弗里想给我带些该死的流浪汉来弥补这一切？！}
#{801}{}{What actually happened?}
{801}{}{到底发生了什么？}
#{850}{}{Do whatever you want. If you find and save David, I'll make a disgustingly rich woman out of you. But remember one thing: If anything happens to him, and I mean any little thing, you'll wish you've never met me. Is that clear?!}
{850}{}{你想干什么就干什么。如果你找到并救了大卫，我会让你变成一个恶心的有钱女人。但请记住一件事：如果他出了什么事，我指的是任何小事，你都会希望你从未见过我。明白了吗？！}
#{851}{}{Yes, sir.}
{851}{}{是的，先生。}
#{852}{}{If that's the case, I have no interest in trying to find your son.}
{852}{}{如果是这样的话，我没有兴趣去找你儿子。}
#{900}{}{What do you want? Have you found out something about David?!}
{900}{}{你想要什么？你发现大卫的事了吗？！}
#{901}{}{It looks like he's being held in Little Hub. One of the kidnappers operates there.}
{901}{}{他好像被关在小中心。其中一个绑匪在那里活动。}
#{902}{}{I'm afraid he's been transported from the city, probably with one of the caravans.}
{902}{}{恐怕他是从城里运来的，可能和一辆大篷车一起。}
#{903}{}{Not yet.}
{903}{}{还没有。}
#{904}{}{Nah-aa.}
{904}{}{不，aa。}
#{950}{}{So fuckin' do something and stop wasting my time! My son's life's at stake!}
{950}{}{所以他妈的做点什么别再浪费我的时间了！我儿子的生命危在旦夕！}
#{951}{}{Yes, sir.}
{951}{}{是的，先生。}
#{952}{}{Hoo.}
{952}{}{呼。}
#{1000}{}{Where exactly?! There's lots of houses there! And where did you get that from?}
{1000}{}{到底在哪？！那里有很多房子！你从哪儿弄来的？}
#{1001}{}{That's not important. But he's surely there. Somewhere.}
{1001}{}{那不重要。但他肯定在那里。在某个地方。}
#{1002}{}{David's nanny told me. She was paid to let David be taken.}
{1002}{}{大卫的保姆告诉我的。她付钱让大卫被带走。}
#{1050}{}{Where exactly?! There's lots of houses there! And where did you get that from?}
{1050}{}{到底在哪？！那里有很多房子！你从哪儿弄来的？}
#{1051}{}{That's not important. But he's surely there. Somewhere.}
{1051}{}{那不重要。但他肯定在那里。在某个地方。}
#{1052}{}{David's nanny told me. She was paid to let David be taken.}
{1052}{}{大卫的保姆告诉我的。她付钱让大卫被带走。}
#{1100}{}{Fine, I'll have my people turn the place inside out. They'll leave no stone unturned. I'll have them take down everyone who just as little as smells suspicious.}
{1100}{}{好吧，我会让我的人把这地方翻个底朝天。他们会千方百计的。我会让他们干掉所有闻起来可疑的人。}
#{1101}{}{That's too risky; it could scare the kidnappers. Perhaps I can find out exactly where the kidnappers are hiding.}
{1101}{}{那太冒险了，会吓到绑匪的。也许我能查出绑匪藏在哪里。}
#{1150}{}{So what're you waiting for? I want my son back, now!}
{1150}{}{你还在等什么？我要我儿子回来，现在！}
#{1151}{}{Yes, sir.}
{1151}{}{是的，先生。}
#{1200}{}{That bitch! I pulled her out of that cesspit called the world, let her take care of my own son, and this is what I get?! That stupid bitch! I never trusted her, and I was right. She's going to hang!}
{1200}{}{那个婊子！我把她从那个叫世界的粪坑里拉出来，让她照顾我自己的儿子，这就是我得到的？！那个愚蠢的婊子！我从不相信她，我是对的。她要被绞死了！}
#{1201}{}{So what do you want to do with Little Hub?}
{1201}{}{那你想用小集线器做什么？}
#{1250}{}{They couldn't have just packed him like that! That caravan was either very well paid, so no one would ask any questions, or one of those damn companies is involved! Everyone who's got anything to do with this's going to suffer! I'll kill a damned Member of the Council if something happens to my son!}
{1250}{}{他们不可能就这样收拾他！那辆大篷车要么薪水很高，所以没人会问任何问题，要么就是那些该死的公司中的一家卷入其中！所有和这事有关的人都会遭殃的！如果我儿子出事，我会杀了一个该死的委员会成员！}
#{1251}{}{I'll try to find out more.}
{1251}{}{我会努力找出更多的。}
#{1300}{}{Where is my son? Have you found anything out, damn it?! Those crooks sent me a request for ransom! They kidnap my son and think I'll give them a hundred thousand caps! Fools! I'll have all of them killed, as soon as we find them!}
{1300}{}{我儿子呢？你发现什么了吗，该死的？！那些骗子向我索要赎金！他们绑架了我儿子，以为我会给他们十万个瓶盖！笨蛋！我们一找到他们，我就把他们全杀了！}
#{1301}{}{I've managed to find a house in Little Hub where he was imprisoned. He's not there anymore, it looks like they took him to Albuquerque.}
{1301}{}{我在小中心找到了一所他被囚禁的房子。他不在了，好像他们把他带到了阿尔伯克基。}
#{1302}{}{I still don't know anything.}
{1302}{}{我还是什么都不知道。}
#{1303}{}{Nah-aa.}
{1303}{}{不，aa。}
#{1350}{}{Damn it! They say that place's huge. They don't even have real police there! You have to find out exactly where David is held! And hurry up, they're going to ask for the ransom soon.}
{1350}{}{该死的！他们说那地方很大。他们连真正的警察都没有！你得弄清楚大卫被关在哪里！快点，他们很快就会要赎金的。}
#{1351}{}{Yes, sir.}
{1351}{}{是的，先生。}
#{1400}{}{So what do you know about my son?! Where is he? There's no time for fucking games!}
{1400}{}{你对我儿子了解多少？！他在哪？没时间玩他妈的游戏了！}
#{1401}{}{He was kidnapped and is held by a gang from Albuquerque. They operate there completely openly. Their leader is someone called Vex.}
{1401}{}{他被绑架了，被一个来自阿尔伯克基的帮派关押。他们在那里完全公开运作。他们的领袖是一个叫Vex的人。}
#{1402}{}{I've got nothing new.}
{1402}{}{我没有什么新东西。}
#{1403}{}{Nah-aa.}
{1403}{}{不，aa。}
#{1450}{}{I'll send there all my people from the Sedit police! They will deal with all those fuckers, every one of 'em!}
{1450}{}{我要把塞迪特警察局的人都派过去！他们会对付所有这些混蛋的，每一个！}
#{1451}{}{I don't recommend that; the city walls are held by men with far better equipment and they are not interested in Vex's activities. I'm sure you don't want David to die in a shootout. I'll get him out of there, somehow.}
{1451}{}{我不建议这样，城墙是由装备好得多的人把持的，他们对维克斯的活动不感兴趣。我肯定你不想大卫死于枪战。我会把他弄出来的。}
#{1500}{}{Don't fuck this up! My son's life's at risk. That means your life's at risk, too!}
{1500}{}{别搞砸了！我儿子有生命危险。那意味着你的生命也有危险！}
#{1501}{}{Got it.}
{1501}{}{知道了。}
#{1550}{}{I knew you'd show up. My son is fine and so I will do what I promised. Here's 10,000 caps. Better watch yourself real well with that kind of money.}
{1550}{}{我就知道你会出现。我儿子很好，所以我会履行我的诺言。这是一万顶瓶盖。拿着那笔钱你最好小心点。}
#{1551}{}{I will.}
{1551}{}{我会的。}
#{1552}{}{Goodie.}
{1552}{}{很好。}
#{1600}{}{There's nothing else for you to do here. Leave.}
{1600}{}{你在这里没别的事可做。离开。}
#{1601}{}{OK.}
{1601}{}{好 啊。}
#{1602}{}{Hoo.}
{1602}{}{呼。}
#{1650}{}{Do I know you? What the hell're you doing here?}
{1650}{}{我认识你吗？你到底在这里干什么？}
#{1651}{}{I am, uh... new! I'm the new guy.}
{1651}{}{我，呃。。。新的！我是新来的。}
#{1652}{}{I am, uh... new! I'm the new guard.}
{1652}{}{我，呃。。。新的！我是新警卫。}
#{1653}{}{Ugh?}
{1653}{}{呃？}
#{1700}{}{You think I'm an idiot?! I know about every single policeman that guards here and you're not one of them.}
{1700}{}{你以为我是白痴？！我知道这里每一个守卫的警察，而你不是他们中的一员。}
#{1701}{}{Damn.}
{1701}{}{该死。}
#{1750}{}{David is dead! My only son is dead! You were supposed to save him, you fucked it up! You shouldn't have!}
{1750}{}{大卫死了！我唯一的儿子死了！你应该救他的，你搞砸了！你不该这样！}
#{1751}{}{But I...}

#{1801}{}{But I...}
{1801}{}{但我。。。}
#{350}{}{Damn It! What's that damned noise?!}
{350}{}{该死的！那该死的噪音是什么？！}
#{351}{}{Could someone explain to me what's going on here?!}
{351}{}{有人能解释一下这是怎么回事吗？！}
#{352}{}{I'm sorry, sir, I dropped a couple of things.}
{352}{}{对不起，先生，我掉了一些东西。}
#{353}{}{Can't you be more careful, stupid woman?!}
{353}{}{你不能再小心点吗，愚蠢的女人？！}
#{354}{}{I... I'm sorry.}
{354}{}{一、 。。。我很抱歉。}
#{355}{}{I want quiet in my own house. That's not much to ask, is it?!}
{355}{}{我想在自己的房子里安静。没什么好问的，是吗？！}
#{356}{}{No, sir, I'm sorry. It won't happen again.}
{356}{}{不，先生，对不起。不会再发生了。}
#{357}{}{You better make sure it won't.}
{357}{}{你最好确定不会。}
