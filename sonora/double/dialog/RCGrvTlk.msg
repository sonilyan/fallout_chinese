### {227}{}{The general once told me over a cup of herbal tea. When the nuclear bombs fell a hundred years ago, these lands were covered with clouds of radioactive ash. The clouds came from the west, east and south, depending on where the wind was blowing from. It was bad everywhere in those years. They say the land here has been barren for generations. Only cacti managed to maintain their life cycle thanks to deep roots. And only now the earth has begun to recover.}
{227}{}{将军曾经边喝凉茶边告诉我。当100年前核弹落下时，这些土地上覆盖着放射性火山灰云。云层来自西部、东部和南部，这取决于风从哪里吹来。那些年到处都很糟糕。他们说这里的土地几代人以来都是贫瘠的。只有仙人掌由于根系深厚而得以维持其生命周期。直到现在，地球才开始复苏。 -- The general once told me over a cup of herbal tea.

### {233}{}{Young people are impatient. Working on plantations is exhausting for them. But the earth gives its fruits only to those who have worked hard for many years. So is my Jacob.

{233}{}{年轻人不耐烦。在种植园工作对他们来说很累人。但是，地球只把它的果实送给那些辛勤工作多年的人。我的雅各布也是。他去找护林员，以免在床上乱来。巡逻时第一次遇到袭击者就夺去了他的生命。 -- Young people are impatient. Working on plantations is exhausting for them.

By this they mean to say that even after death one should not lose the strength of the spirit.}
