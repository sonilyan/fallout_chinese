#{100}{}{You see a man.}

#{150}{}{You see Pus.}
{150}{}{你看到脓了。}
#{200}{}{You see a man in a dirty, tattered robe. The hood fails to cover a gruesome pimple on his face, oozing with pus.}
{200}{}{你看到一个穿着肮脏破烂的长袍的男人。引擎盖没能遮住他脸上一个可怕的小疙瘩，渗出脓液。}
#{250}{}{You see a man known by everyone as Pus. You believe it MAY have to do with the disgusting ulcer on his face. To be honest, the roasted meat he sells seems equally appetizing.}
{250}{}{你看到一个大家都知道的叫脓的人。你认为这可能和他脸上恶心的溃疡有关。老实说，他卖的烤肉似乎同样开胃。}
#{400}{}{Pus not like.}
{400}{}{我不喜欢。}
#{401}{}{Pus just roast and sell meat.}
{401}{}{我只是烤肉和卖肉。}
#{402}{}{Pus no understand.}

#{405}{}{Pus do not want!}
{405}{}{我不要！}
#{500}{}{You hungry? Pus sell roasted meat, only 5 bottle caps a piece. Pus meat is cheap and tasty.}
{500}{}{你饿了吗？卖烤肉，一块只有5个瓶盖。脓肉又便宜又好吃。}
#{501}{}{Pus?}
{501}{}{脓？}
#{502}{}{Puss?}
{502}{}{猫咪？}
#{550}{}{Everyone call Pus Pus. [He points to the stomach-turning pimple on his face.] But Pus don't mind, he roast meat slices and people pay. Pus happy with life.}
{550}{}{大家都叫脓。[他指了指脸上的胃疙瘩。]不过别介意，他烤肉片，人们付钱。我对生活很满意。}
#{551}{}{That meat seems suspiciously cheap. Where do you get it from and how do you roast it?}
{551}{}{那肉似乎便宜得令人怀疑。你从哪里弄来的，怎么烤？}
#{552}{}{5 bottle caps for a piece of meat, you say? Nothing else on the menu?}
{552}{}{你说一块肉要5个瓶盖？菜单上没有别的吗？}
#{553}{}{Did you have a doctor take a look at that pimple? He could check your head as well while he's at it.}
{553}{}{你有没有请医生看一下那个痘痘？他也可以检查你的头。}
#{554}{}{I'm not wasting any more time with you, goodbye.}
{554}{}{我不会再和你浪费时间了，再见。}
#{600}{}{No person ask Pus this before. You really interested?}
{600}{}{以前没人问过这个。你真的感兴趣吗？}
#{601}{}{Of course I'm interested. Take it from the beginning. Where you get the meat from, how you prepare it...}
{601}{}{我当然有兴趣。从头开始。你从哪里得到肉，怎么做。。。}
#{602}{}{Actually, not really. Forget about it.}
{602}{}{实际上，不是真的。算了吧。}
#{650}{}{Pus buy from hospital. Doctors sell cheap when they don't need anymore. Pus cut meat into tiny pieces, must select carefully, throw away what don't eat. Like needles, sutures, wires...}
{650}{}{从医院买的脓。医生不再需要的时候就廉价出售。脓肉切成小块，一定要仔细挑选，扔掉不吃的东西。像针，缝线，电线。。。}
#{651}{}{Slow down there! You wanna say that this is human flesh?}
{651}{}{慢点！你想说这是人肉？}
#{652}{}{Great. What do you do with the meat then?}
{652}{}{伟大的。那你怎么处理这些肉呢？}
#{700}{}{Don't be silly, hospital no treat animals. Just imagine... hehe. [He starts laughing.] That is funny. Of course it is human meat. Doctors work with bodies of different things. When something left over, they say, of no use, they sell to Pus.}
{700}{}{别傻了，医院不治疗动物。想象一下。。。呵呵。[他笑了起来]真有趣。当然是人的肉。医生用不同的东西来治疗身体。当剩下的东西，他们说，没有用，他们卖脓。}
#{701}{}{Don't be silly, lady, hospital no treat animals. Just imagine... hehe. [He starts laughing.] That is funny. Of course it is human meat. Doctors work with bodies of different things. When something left over, they say, of no use, they sell to Pus.}

#{702}{}{What do you do with the meat from the hospital afterwards?}
{702}{}{你以后怎么处理医院的肉？}
#{750}{}{Then Pus find things that burn. He put them in his barrel and make fire. Pus roast meat on fire. Meat much more tastier than raw, that is why people buy from Pus.}
{750}{}{然后找到燃烧的东西。他把它们放进桶里生火。烤肉放在火上。肉比生的好吃得多，这就是为什么人们买脓。}
#{751}{}{You wanna say you roast on anything that burns?}
{751}{}{你想说你在任何会燃烧的东西上烤吗？}
#{752}{}{Uh-huh. Do you have many customers?}
{752}{}{啊哈。你有很多顾客吗？}
#{800}{}{Pus discover that some things make meat taste different. Tires you can taste a lot. But Pus cannot be picky. Pus think it still better than raw meat.}
{800}{}{我们发现有些东西使肉的味道不同。你可以尝到很多。但是脓不能挑剔。我觉得还是比生肉好。}

#{856}{}{Ehmmm... I better be going.}
{856}{}{嗯。。。我最好走了。}
#{900}{}{Pus not know what you mean, head not hurt. Pus not have so many bottle caps to go to hospital. Pus don't mind pimple on face... just must not scratch too often.}
{900}{}{脓不知道你的意思，头不疼。我没有那么多瓶盖要去医院。脓不介意脸上长痘痘。。。只是不能经常抓。}
#{901}{}{You know what, better tell me where you get the meat from and how you prepare it.}

{1051}{}{我觉得不太舒服。肉新鲜吗？或者你烤得不够？}
