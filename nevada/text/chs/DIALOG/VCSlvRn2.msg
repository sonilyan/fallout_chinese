#{100}{}{You see Gareth.}
{100}{}{你看到加雷斯了。}
#{101}{}{You see a seemingly ordinary passer-by.}
{101}{}{你看到一个看似普通的路人。}
#{102}{}{*running script error*}
{102}{}{*运行脚本错误*}
#{110}{}{Uh... Hello, wanderer. And... Have a good day.}
{110}{}{Uh...你好，流浪者。还有...祝您今天过得愉快。}
#{111}{}{Wait, what are you doing here?}
{111}{}{等等，你在这里干什么？}
#{112}{}{Whatever.}
{112}{}{无论什么。}
#{113}{}{Uh... [looks closely at your face] You look like one of these [pointing in the direction of the slavers office]. So, sorry, but I will be on my way.}
{113}{}{Uh...[仔细看你的脸]你看起来像这些人中的一个[指向奴隶办公室的方向]。对不起，我马上就来。}
#{114}{}{Do I really look that bad...}
{114}{}{我真的那么难看吗...}
#{115}{}{Uh... [looks closely at your face] Are you one of these [pointing in the direction of the slavers office]? What are *you* doing here?}
{115}{}{Uh...[仔细看你的脸]你是这些人中的一员吗[指着奴隶办公室的方向]？你在这里干什么？}
#{116}{}{I asked first.}
{116}{}{我先问。}
#{117}{}{I'm just passing by, minding my own business.}
{117}{}{我只是路过，管好自己的事。}
#{118}{}{I'm looking for a fresh slave.}
{118}{}{我在找一个新奴隶。}
#{119}{}{Nothing that would justify a conversation with you.}
{119}{}{没有什么能证明和你谈话是正当的。}
#{120}{}{Then I guess we have nothing to talk about.}
{120}{}{那我想我们没什么好谈的了。}
#{121}{}{Uh...}
{121}{}{Uh...}
#{122}{}{See, you have no confidence in me. That means I should refrain from talking with you.}
{122}{}{看，你对我没有信心。那意味着我不应该和你说话。}
#{123}{}{So you are not one of them? Phew, at least someone in this city is "just a passerby", and not a member of some nefarious organization.}
{123}{}{所以你不是他们中的一员？唉，至少这个城市有人“只是个过路人”，而不是某个邪恶组织的成员。}
#{124}{}{And you are a member of which organization?}
{124}{}{你是哪个组织的成员？}
#{125}{}{Yeah. Well, it was nice to talk to you.}
{125}{}{是 啊。很高兴和你谈话。}
#{126}{}{The member of the secret sect of Avengers... Just joking. Heh-heh.}
{126}{}{复仇者秘密教派的成员...开玩笑而已。嘿嘿。}
#{127}{}{Wow, can I join your sect?}
{127}{}{哇，我能加入你的门派吗？}
#{128}{}{Damn, you're taking me for a moron?}
{128}{}{该死，你把我当成白痴？}
#{129}{}{He-he. Bye, damn joker.}
{129}{}{他，他。再见，该死的小丑。}
#{130}{}{Well, you can't join without testing. We are literally two people. It is unlikely that you will want to be a part of it. The risks and stuff...}
{130}{}{嗯，没有测试你不能加入。我们真的是两个人。你不太可能想成为它的一部分。风险之类的...}
#{131}{}{Hey, don't get mad, I didn't do anything wrong!}
{131}{}{嘿，别生气，我没做错什么！}
#{132}{}{You've already popped up, so you'd better tell me what you're up to.}
{132}{}{你已经出现了，所以你最好告诉我你在干什么。}
#{133}{}{I think you are in trouble. Tell me, maybe I could help.}
{133}{}{我想你有麻烦了。告诉我，也许我能帮上忙。}
#{134}{}{So, I'll believe you... This time. Bye.}
{134}{}{所以，我相信你...这一次。再见。}
#{135}{}{Oh, okay. Anyway, I can't do this alone.}
{135}{}{哦，好吧。不管怎样，我一个人做不到。}
#{136}{}{So what's your problem?}
{136}{}{那你有什么问题？}
#{137}{}{The problem isn't mine, it's my brother's. Damn slavers grabbed him when he returned to the city and locked him in the corral. I want to rescue him, but it's not easy.}
{137}{}{问题不是我的，是我哥哥的。该死的奴隶贩子在他回到城里时抓住了他，把他锁在畜栏里。我想救他，但不容易。}
#{138}{}{Do you have a plan?}
{138}{}{你有计划吗？}
#{139}{}{I have a plan, yes, but first I need to contact Eric. However, one can penetrate the corral only as a slave. And it means being branded for life.}
{139}{}{我有个计划，是的，但首先我要联系埃里克。然而，一个人只能作为奴隶进入畜栏。这意味着被终身烙印。}
#{140}{}{How do you know he's there?}
{140}{}{你怎么知道他在那儿？}
#{141}{}{This is an option, isn't it? You will become a slave, and I will redeem you.}
{141}{}{这是一个选择，不是吗？你必作奴仆，我必救赎你。}
#{142}{}{I can bring the note to your brother.}
{142}{}{我可以把纸条带给你哥哥。}
#{143}{}{Uh, today it won't be my headache, take care.}
{143}{}{呃，今天我不头疼了，保重。}
#{144}{}{One friend saw him and said that he is here. And then I found the gap in the fence and saw him among the slaves.}
{144}{}{一个朋友看到他说他在这儿。后来我发现篱笆上有个缺口，看见他在奴隶中间。}
#{145}{}{Not an option. First, there is no guarantee that you will have time to redeem me before the others do, and second, I don't want to walk with the mark on the forehead for the rest of my life.}
{145}{}{别无选择。首先，不能保证你会在别人之前有时间救赎我，其次，我不想一辈子都带着额头上的印记走路。}
#{146}{}{Are you going to get in there?! Why!? Once you are there, you won't come back without a mark on the forehead!}
{146}{}{你要进去吗？！为什么？一旦你到了那里，你就不会回来了，额头上就没有一点痕迹！}
#{147}{}{Don't worry about me, I know what to do.}
{147}{}{别担心我，我知道该怎么办。}
#{148}{}{Well, it's up to you...}
{148}{}{好吧，这取决于你...}
#{149}{}{I'll do it if you pay me.}
{149}{}{如果你付钱给我，我就做。}
#{150}{}{Right, it's too silly. Risk yourself, and I'm leaving.}
{150}{}{对，这太傻了。冒险，我就走。}
#{151}{}{Oh, it's you. Hello.}
{151}{}{哦，是你。你好。}
#{152}{}{So what was that about the problems with your brother?}
{152}{}{你哥哥的问题是什么？}
#{153}{}{Yeah, it's me, relax.}
{153}{}{是的，是我，放松。}
#{154}{}{Damn, that would be great. You just need to pass a note to Eric.}
{154}{}{妈的，那太好了。你只需要给埃里克一张便条。}
#{155}{}{Just a note, I'll do it.}
{155}{}{只要一张纸条，我就做。}
#{156}{}{I changed my mind, sorry.}
{156}{}{我改变主意了，对不起。}
#{157}{}{Hey, wait. I can pay 200 bucks if you can do it. Would have paid more if I had more... But, of course, I'm not paying immediately, so there would be motivation for you not to cheat. You just need to pass a note to Eric, nothing more.}
{157}{}{嘿，等等。如果你能做到，我可以付200美元。如果我有更多的...但是，当然，我不会马上付钱，所以你有动机不作弊。你只需要给埃里克一张纸条，就行了。}
#{158}{}{Give me a note, I'll do it.}
{158}{}{给我一张纸条，我来做。}
#{159}{}{Still am not doing it.}
{159}{}{我还是不做。}
#{160}{}{Sure, I'll pay, but after Eric receives a note. However, I only have 200 bucks. Would pay more if I was richer...}
{160}{}{当然，我会付钱的，但是在埃里克收到一张纸条之后。不过，我只有200美元。如果我更富有，我会付更多的钱...}
#{161}{}{Give me a note, I'll do it.}
{161}{}{给我一张纸条，我来做。}
#{162}{}{I changed my mind, sorry.}
{162}{}{我改变主意了，对不起。}
#{163}{}{Here. I'm *really* counting on you! Please, everything depends on you! If this note gets into the hands of traffickers - all would be lost.}
{163}{}{在这里。我真的指望你了！拜托，一切都取决于你！如果这张纸条落入人贩子之手，所有的纸条都会丢失。}
#{164}{}{Okay, I'll think about it.}
{164}{}{好吧，我会考虑的。}
#{200}{}{Well, how is it going, wanderer?}
{200}{}{怎么样，流浪者？}
#{201}{}{I have some bad news - Eric is dead.}
{201}{}{我有个坏消息-埃里克死了。}
#{202}{}{Relax, Eric has got your note.}
{202}{}{别紧张，埃里克收到你的纸条了。}
#{203}{}{I'm still working on it.}
{203}{}{我还在努力。}
#{204}{}{What?! What the hell! You could have mistook him or... Or you are lying even... Or... I don't know what, but I don't believe you!.. Ugh, why I even got involved with you?! Get away from me!}
{204}{}{什么？！我勒个去！你可能误解了他或者...或者你在撒谎...或者...我不知道是什么，但我不相信你！。。啊，为什么我要和你扯上关系？！离我远点！}
#{205}{}{Oh, that's how you choose to act!}
{205}{}{哦，你就是这么选择的！}
#{206}{}{Oh, good! Now it's easier for me to cope with them...}
{206}{}{哦，太好了！现在我更容易对付他们...}
#{207}{}{And my reward?}
{207}{}{我的报酬呢？}
#{208}{}{What? Ah, yes. But wait, how do I know you're not tricking me? No, first I'll check.}
{208}{}{什么？啊，是的。等等，我怎么知道你没骗我？不，我先查一下。}
#{209}{}{WHAT?!}
{209}{}{什么？！}
#{210}{}{It's very simple. We will wait for the evening and you'll see.}
{210}{}{很简单。我们等晚上，你会看到的。}
#{211}{}{Okay, let's wait.}
{211}{}{好吧，我们等一下。}
#{212}{}{Hell no! Pay me now!}
{212}{}{他妈的不！现在付钱给我！}
#{213}{}{Then I'll be back later.}
{213}{}{那我晚点回来。}
#{214}{}{I have no money right now. You'll have to wait.}
{214}{}{我现在没有钱。你得等等。}
#{215}{}{I have an idea. You see, the bartender at the ring said that they want to take Eric to the ring. I managed to overhear the talks of the slavers, so now.}
{215}{}{我有个主意。你看，拳击场的酒保说他们想带埃里克去拳击场。我无意中听到了奴隶主的谈话，所以现在。}
#{216}{}{Great! I think you will not be bored.}
{216}{}{太好了！我想你不会觉得无聊的。}
#{217}{}{Will see.}
{217}{}{我们拭目以待。}
#{218}{}{The slaves are now free, nothing is keeping them.}
{218}{}{奴隶们现在自由了，没有什么能留住他们。}
#{219}{}{Wonderful news! And I just been thinking about what is that suspicious movement that is happening in the corral. Thank you, wanderer! Here, take 200 bucks for the risk. That's all I have.}
{219}{}{好消息！我在想畜栏里正在发生的可疑活动是什么。谢谢你，流浪者！给，冒200块的险。我只有这些了。}
#{220}{}{Of course, take care!}
{220}{}{当然，保重！}
#{221}{}{Thanks for the help, wanderer. I was glad to meet such a wonderful person. Here [hands 200 bucks] - all I can give for your help.}
{221}{}{谢谢你的帮助，流浪者。我很高兴见到这么好的人。这是我能给你的帮助。}
#{222}{}{Wait, how did you know that Eric will be took to the ring?}
{222}{}{等等，你怎么知道埃里克会被带上拳击场？}
#{223}{}{First learned from the bartender, I know him. And then overheard the talks on the radio channel of the slavers. By the way, here, take it, I don't need it anymore. Maybe you'll find a use for it.}
{223}{}{我是从酒保那里学来的，我认识他。然后偷听了奴隶主的谈话。顺便说一下，拿着，我不需要了。也许你会找到它的用处。}
#{224}{}{Thanks. Well, take care.}
{224}{}{谢谢。好吧，保重。}
#{225}{}{It all was in vain... [grabs his head]}
{225}{}{这一切都是徒劳的...[抓住他的头]}
