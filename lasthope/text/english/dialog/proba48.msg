{100}{}{You see: a local tradesman.}
{101}{}{He looks like a jack of all trades. Mechanic, trader, hunter and probably something on the side.}
#1
{102}{}{Good day to you. I'm Bob. Can I help you with something? I got plenty of stuff, maybe offer you a job,
 anything you need. [Shows you a gun under the table.] Anything.}
#1
{103}{}{I'll keep that in mind. Tell me about that job you are offering.}
{104}{}{Sure thing. I wanna see the stuff you have.}
#2
{105}{}{Jobs... Let me see... [Looks in his book.] Yes, I'm lacking in gecko pelts. I need about ten pieces. I make good
 money with them, people just love 'em. I will pay you $100 for each piece. So that is $1000 for ten pieces, right?
 [Scratches his head.] So, can you get them for me?}
#2
{106}{}{Sure, I'll come back when I have them.}
{107}{}{I'm not interested in the job right now. I'll be back later. Bye.}
#2
{108}{}{Did you find those pelts?}
{109}{}{Yes, I did. Ten pieces, here they are. [Hand him the pelts.]}
{110}{}{Nope, still working on it.}
#2
{111}{}{Yep, ten pieces, all here. [Hands you the money.] Here you go, pal. Come back anytime, I might have more
 jobs for you.}
{112}{}{Goodbye.}
#3
{113}{}{Sorry, don't have any jobs at the moment. Come back tomorrow morning.}
{114}{}{Good day.}
#
{115}{}{Good trading with you, come back anytime.}
{116}{}{Bye.}
#
{117}{}{Welcome again, what will it be this time? A job? Some trading?}
{118}{}{I need work.}
{119}{}{I'm looking to buy.}
#
{120}{}{Yes, pal? Need anything?}
{121}{}{Got any work?}
#
{122}{}{Tell you what, if you could get me some tools, I could give you some healing items. Do we have a deal?}
{123}{}{Sounds good to me.}
{124}{}{Sorry, I can find my own supplies.}
#
{125}{}{Here's what I need. I'm repairing some old piece of junk. Damn thing always breaks down. You get
 me a wrench and pliers. Come back when you got them.}
{126}{}{OK. Bye.}
#
{127}{}{Did you get the tools I asked you for?}
{128}{}{No, I don't have them yet.}
{129}{}{Here they are.}
#
{130}{}{Thanks for those tools. I think you've earned these. [Gives you two stimpaks.]}
{131}{}{Thanks, I will. Take care.}
# between 18h i 6h
{132}{}{I don't sell stuff at night.}
{133}{}{Come back when it's day.}
{134}{}{...chr...zzz...chr...}
{135}{}{Could you refrain from waking me up at night?}
#
{136}{}{Hey, if you want to save yourself some trouble I can recommend you somebody. This guy is a gecko hunter, a
 very good one in fact. So if you need help you go talk to him, tell him I sent you. He's usually at the bar... By the way,
 his name is Mark.}
{137}{}{OK, see you later.}
