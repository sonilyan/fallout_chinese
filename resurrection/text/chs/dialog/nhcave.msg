{100}{}{整个山洞都被清理了。}
#{200}{}{Your vision is slowly getting used to the darkness of the cave. Your head is throbbing with a pain that is almost impossible to bear. Only with great difficulty do you manage to stay conscious. The stench of old excrement and rotting flesh wafting through the lair turns your stomach.}
{200}{}{你的视力正在慢慢适应洞穴的黑暗。你的头因为几乎无法忍受的疼痛而悸动。你很难保持清醒。老旧的粪便和腐烂的肉飘过巢穴的恶臭让你反胃。}
