### {100}{}{Greetings, stranger. I'm Colin the farmer. Want to buy some of my brahmin? Fresh stock right out of Farmers Town?}
{100}{}{问候，陌生人。我是农民科林。想买一些我的婆罗门吗？农民镇的新鲜存货？}
### {101}{}{I'm interested in getting some information.}
{101}{}{我有兴趣了解一些情况。}
### {102}{}{No, thanks.}
{102}{}{不用了，谢谢。}
### {103}{}{Sure, how can this fella help you?}
{103}{}{当然，这个家伙能帮你什么？}
### {104}{}{What do you do here?}
{104}{}{你在这里做什么？}
### {105}{}{What can you tell me about Farmers Town?}
{105}{}{关于农民镇，你能告诉我什么？}
### {106}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{106}{}{让我再问你一件事。}
### {107}{}{Well, being a farmer, I tend to my brahmin and sell them to make some money. Let me tell you, it's so hard these days to earn even a modest living. Mantis raids, cattle thieves... I must work all day and night, and even then I can't manage to cover the losses. My brahmin headcount keeps going down, can't get any worse than this...}
{107}{}{嗯，作为一个农民，我照顾我的婆罗门，把它们卖掉赚些钱。让我告诉你，现在连微薄的生活都很难挣。螳螂袭击，偷牛贼。。。我必须夜以继日地工作，即使那样我也无法弥补损失。我的婆罗门人数一直在下降，再糟糕不过了。。。}
### {108}{}{What's this about mantis raids?}
{108}{}{这是关于螳螂袭击的什么？}
### {109}{}{Who are these thieves?}
{109}{}{这些小偷是谁？}
### {110}{}{I'm afraid it can... It really is a hard life, wasteland and all... Let me change the subject.}
{110}{}{恐怕它会。。。这真的是一种艰苦的生活，荒地和所有。。。让我换个话题。}
### {111}{}{Those small bastards like to come out of their holes and tunnels and prowl around, mostly during night time. A couple of times they left my cowshed almost empty. I tried everything to drive them off, but only managed to get attacked and earn myself some scars. Now it serves as a reminder to use my head, not my shovel...}
{111}{}{那些小混蛋喜欢从洞里和隧道里出来四处游荡，大多是在晚上。有几次他们让我的牛棚几乎空无一人。我想尽一切办法把他们赶走，但最终还是遭到了袭击，给自己留下了一些伤痕。现在它提醒我要用我的头，而不是我的铲子。。。}
### {112}{}{I'm sure you'll do that. Tell me something...}
{112}{}{我相信你会那样做的。告诉我。。。}
### {113}{}{Hm... I'm not sure. I thought they were some tribals, but they were armed with clubs and guns. Nothing I could do.}
{113}{}{嗯…我不确定。我以为他们是部落成员，但他们手持棍棒和枪支。我无能为力。}
### {114}{}{I'm sorry. Can you answer me something...}
{114}{}{对不起。你能回答我一些问题吗。。。}
### {115}{}{It's a small community east from here. I used to live there, at least a year, before I moved along with my business. Lots of trouble for such a small place. No traffic, just a few locals and a bunch of gun-obsessed ruffians. Not very pleasant... Some would say it's heading for lawlessness and violence.}
{115}{}{从这里往东是一个小社区。我曾经在那里住过至少一年，后来我开始经营我的生意。这么小的地方真麻烦。没有交通，只有几个当地人和一群持枪歹徒。不是很愉快。。。有人会说，它正在走向无法无天和暴力。}
### {116}{}{It can't be that bad. Oh well, let me ask you something else.}
{116}{}{不会那么糟糕。哦，好吧，让我问你另外一件事。}
### {117}{}{Just say it.}
{117}{}{说吧。}
### {118}{}{No thanks. But I have some good news regarding the mantis raids...}
{118}{}{不用了，谢谢。但我有一些关于螳螂袭击的好消息。。。}
### {119}{}{I heard what happened. That's the best damn news so far. With those big bugs dropping in numbers I may actually earn something for a living after all. I think I know how to repay you. [Searches his bag and pulls out a dusty old map.] Here it is. This map will help you as much as it has helped me during my traveling days. It holds most if not all safe paths I could find in the surrounding areas.}
{119}{}{我听说了发生的事。这是迄今为止最好的该死的消息。随着这些大虫子数量的减少，我可能真的会挣点钱谋生。我想我知道如何报答你。[翻了翻他的包，拿出一张满是灰尘的旧地图。]给你。这张地图对你的帮助和我旅行时的帮助一样大。它包含了我在周围地区能找到的大多数（如果不是全部的话）安全路径。}
### {120}{}{Thanks. Yes indeed, this could be useful.}
{120}{}{谢谢的确，这可能是有用的。}
### {121}{}{Well, being a farmer, I breed brahmin and sell them to make some money. Let me tell you, it's so hard these days to earn even a modest living. But with those mantis raids gone, I can breathe a little easier. Thankfully, things are closer to normal than they used to be, and it shows. Still, there's more work to be done...}
{121}{}{嗯，作为一个农民，我养殖婆罗门并把它们卖掉赚些钱。让我告诉你，现在连微薄的生活都很难挣。但随着那些螳螂袭击的消失，我可以松一口气了。值得庆幸的是，事情比过去更接近正常了，这表明了这一点。尽管如此，还有更多的工作要做。。。}
### {122}{}{I'm sure about that. I had something else on my mind...}
{122}{}{我对此很确定。我还有别的想法。。。}
### {123}{}{Nice to see you again. Interested in buying some of my brahmin?}
{123}{}{很高兴再次见到你。有兴趣买一些我的婆罗门吗？}
### {124}{}{Actually there's nothing I wanted to ask you. I'm off.}
{124}{}{实际上我没有什么想问你的。我要走了。}
### {125}{}{Have you heard anything about patrols from that prison up north?}
{125}{}{你听说过北边那个监狱的巡逻队吗？}
### {126}{}{Yes, I think I've heard a thing or two. And, of course, the sheriff told me about the situation here. Why are you asking?}
{126}{}{是的，我想我听到了一两件事。当然，警长告诉了我这里的情况。你为什么要问？}
### {127}{}{Have you seen anyone coming from there?}
{127}{}{你看到有人从那里来吗？}
### {128}{}{I just want you to be careful, that's all.}
{128}{}{我只是希望你小心一点，仅此而已。}
### {129}{}{Anyone, like who? You mean patrols? I've seen them just outside the town, that's all I know.}
{129}{}{有人，像谁？你是说巡逻？我在城外见过他们，我只知道这些。}
### {130}{}{Sure, nevermind then.}
{130}{}{当然，没关系。}
### {131}{}{Hey, I ain't talking to you.}
{131}{}{嘿，我不和你说话。}
### {132}{}{Just leave me be.}
{132}{}{别管我。}
### {133}{}{What? Have I done something wrong?}
{133}{}{什么我做错什么了吗？}
### {134}{}{You aren't here to take me away, are you?}
{134}{}{你不是来带走我的，是吗？}
### {135}{}{Actually, I don't have time to talk right now.}
{135}{}{事实上，我现在没有时间说话。}
### {136}{}{What about those thieves...}
{136}{}{那些小偷呢。。。}
### {137}{}{You said something about mantis raids...}
{137}{}{你说了一些关于螳螂袭击的事。。。}
