#{130}{}{Enemies of the Wind of War are plenty, but mostly raiders and gangs, as well as loads of mutants - tarantulas and aliens.}

#{134}{}{Squads of raiders and other bandits, with which the Wind of War is fighting for influence over the region, usually are few in numbers, from 5 to 15 people. Some thugs hold power over smaller settlements, whose residents are tired of their oppression and asking for help.}
{134}{}{为争夺对该地区的影响而发动战争的突击队和其他强盗，通常人数很少，从5人到15人不等。一些暴徒掌握着较小的定居点的权力，这些定居点的居民厌倦了他们的压迫并寻求帮助。}
#{135}{}{Predatory mutants of enormous size, living in dark damp places underground. Usually they come to the surface at night. Occasionally, their raids bring casualties among Wind of War population, but more often - among outsiders and merchants, staying in the suburbs. The creatures are intensively fought by Wind of War forces, but their numbers seems to be recovering after each encounter. It is noticed that the highest activity of the mutants observed in the area of the destroyed local vault, but with each new year they are encountered at a greater distance from it.}
{135}{}{体形巨大的食肉突变体，生活在地下阴暗潮湿的地方。它们通常在晚上浮出水面。偶尔，他们的突袭会给战争之风中的人带来伤亡，但更多的时候是住在郊区的外来者和商人。这些生物被战争之风的力量密集地战斗，但它们的数量似乎在每次遭遇后都在恢复。人们注意到，在被摧毁的地方避难所区域观察到的突变体的活动性最高，但随着新年的到来，它们与避难所的距离越来越远。}
#{136}{}{Predatory mutants with infrared vision. Like tarantulas, they do not like sunlight, preferring to come to the surface at night and sleep during the day in dark dungeons. We know for sure, that the main nest of aliens is a military base to the north, the so-called "Area 51".}
{136}{}{具有红外视觉的掠食性突变体。像狼蛛一样，它们不喜欢阳光，喜欢晚上浮出水面，白天在黑暗的地牢里睡觉。我们确信，外星人的主要巢穴是北方的一个军事基地，即所谓的“51区”。}
#{137}{}{Around the Wind of War, mostly along the slopes, there are small settlements, usually two or three families, that are not of interest. To the north, the military base called "Area 51" is located. To the west - the "Hawthorne" military base. Also, among other geographical locations provided, there is a vault in the mountains in the north-west. Apparently, this is the vault from which the local population came.}
{137}{}{战风前后，大多沿着山坡，有一些小的定居点，通常有两三户人家，都不感兴趣。北面是一个名为“51区”的军事基地。西边是“霍桑”军事基地。此外，在提供的其他地理位置中，西北部山区有一个拱顶。很明显，这就是当地居民的地下室。}

{142}{}{“超级8”事件。}
#{143}{}{The incident occurred during the transportation of the dangerous cargo designated as "Super 8". The contents of the cargo are not disclosed in documents. It is known that due to the "oversight of the convoy" cargo disappeared, and the convoy was killed. Soon came a report about the residents of a small village nearby disappearing. The remains of their bodies were found in the caves not far off. It is not clear how these events are connected, but one thing is almost certain - the "Super 8" is no ordinary cargo.}
{143}{}{事件发生在运输被指定为“超级8”的危险货物期间。文件中没有披露货物的内容。据知，由于“护航疏忽”，货物失踪，护航被击毙。不久就有报道说附近一个小村庄的居民失踪了。他们的遗体是在不远处的洞穴里发现的。目前尚不清楚这些事件是如何联系在一起的，但有一点几乎可以肯定，“超级8”不是普通货。}
#{150}{}{The Wind of War is not alien to punitive measures. Many raiders and other criminals were executed here, to threaten residents of the Southern Nevada.}

#{152}{}{Sam Riley, 24 years, male, resident of Las Vegas. The order of execution: cut off the hands, feet, then hang in public on a fence, barely alive. Cause of the execution: received information from our secret agent in Vegas about the intentions of the prisoner - he was engaged in espionage on behalf of one of the reputable inhabitants of the city. The command, as usual, chose the simplest way - to eliminate the enemy spy.}
{152}{}{山姆・莱利，24岁，男性，拉斯维加斯居民。行刑顺序：砍掉手、脚，然后当众挂在篱笆上，奄奄一息。行刑原因：从我们在维加斯的特工那里得到了关于这个囚犯意图的信息――他代表这个城市一个有声望的居民从事间谍活动。指挥部一如既往地选择了最简单的方法――消灭敌人的间谍。}
#{160}{}{It seems that the command of the base really believes in the Old America and its values. For example, the order to caravans was made, about the delivery of a copy of Constitution from the museum in Reno, along with US flags, posters, and various military paraphernalia of the pre-war USA. It is difficult to say, whether it's worth the efforts.}
{160}{}{基地司令部似乎真的相信旧美国及其价值观。例如，向商队发出的命令，是关于从雷诺博物馆交付一份宪法副本，以及美国国旗、海报和战前美国的各种军事用品。很难说，是否值得付出努力。}
