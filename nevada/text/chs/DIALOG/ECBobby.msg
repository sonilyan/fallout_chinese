{101}{}{你看到老朋友鲍比了。}
#{110}{}{Hello wanderer! Be my guest. Everyone is always in haste, running somewhere... You're one of the kind? Wouldn't you stay for a little chat with the old man? Time flows slowly with interesting stories, but are you ready for them?}
{110}{}{你好，流浪者！请便。每个人总是匆匆忙忙，跑向某个地方...你是那种人？你不留下来和那位老人聊聊天吗？时间随着有趣的故事慢慢流逝，但你准备好了吗？}
#{111}{}{Only smokes goes into sky irretrievably, human is free on his way in any direction... Do you want a story about it?}
{111}{}{只有烟无可挽回地飘向天空，人类在任何方向上都是自由的...你想要一个关于它的故事吗？}

{112}{}{呃，好吧，我听着。}
#{113}{}{And you seems to be an wasteland weed expert? It's gonna be fun.}
{113}{}{你好像是荒地杂草专家？会很有趣的。}
#{114}{}{Wow easy! I only here to look around. Don't strain so soon.}
{114}{}{哇，别紧张！我只是来四处看看的。别这么快紧张。}
#{115}{}{Anyway, there were two brothers. Called... Well, let's say Dick and Tom. One of them named Tom always help closest one... And even distant. He was a humble man of heart, a unique one. And his brother couldn't restrain himself from benefiting on someone. He sued his own mother for money she owned him.}
{115}{}{总之，有两个兄弟。打电话...好吧，假设迪克和汤姆。其中一个叫汤姆的总是帮助最亲近的人...甚至是遥远的。他是一个谦虚的人，一个独一无二的人。他哥哥也忍不住要从别人身上获益。他起诉自己的母亲，要她给他的钱。}
#{116}{}{[Next]}
{116}{}{[下一步]}
#{117}{}{And there came Black Saturday, when God, as many believed, gave everyone what they deserved. Tommy, who drove a bunch of clowns to their circus, got eaten by the very same clowns without even salt and pepper... Fun and tasty, ta-ta-ta! But Dick also died... In a slumber. After he had taken a warehouse with medicines and acquired wealth with skillful speculation. That's the story.}
{117}{}{黑色星期六来临了，许多人相信上帝给了每个人应得的东西。汤米，开着一群小丑去马戏团，被同样的小丑吃了，连盐和胡椒都没有...又好玩又好吃，哈哈！但迪克也死了...在睡梦中。他拿了一个装药的仓库，用巧计敛财。这就是故事。}
#{118}{}{Tell me it's just a fiction. I really need to hear it from you. Hey, I'm talking to you!}
{118}{}{告诉我这只是个虚构。我真的很想听你说。嘿，我在和你说话！}
#{119}{}{Excellent! I was ready for some snotty sermon, and how well you turned it around!}
{119}{}{杰出的！我已经准备好接受一些势利的布道了，你把它扭转得多好啊！}
#{120}{}{You're so stoned, I've got nothing to say. I'll return when you'll be normal... If it's possible.}
{120}{}{你喝多了，我无话可说。等你恢复正常我再回来...如果可能的话。}
#{121}{}{I also remembered this one: about old writer from Denver. Extremely positive person he was - always tried to find positive things in any situation. Lost his leg after meeting with stoned cola truck driver - he said now he can finish writing his book without being distracted with meaningless running around.}
{121}{}{我还记得这个：关于丹佛的老作家。他是一个非常积极的人，在任何情况下都会努力寻找积极的东西。他说，现在他可以写完自己的书，而不会因为到处乱跑而分心。}
#{122}{}{In the vault during bombing in 2077, where his relatives complained about their fate to no end, he was happy that everyone finally came together at one table. In the end he was kicked out and became a ghoul - it's great, now radiation is not an issue, so many places to visit!}
{122}{}{在2077年轰炸期间的避难所里，他的亲戚们没完没了地抱怨他们的命运，他很高兴大家终于聚在一桌。最后他被踢了出去，变成了一个食尸鬼――太棒了，现在辐射已经不是问题了，有那么多地方可以参观！}
#{123}{}{Some crazy sectarians crucified him somewhere at Great Plains - good! That means... U-ugh... Well, to be honest, I see no positives in this case. But he'd think something out, rest assured. Don't worry, be happy.}
{123}{}{一些疯狂的宗派主义者在大平原某处把他钉在十字架上-好！这意味着...呃...嗯，老实说，我看不出这个案子有什么积极的一面。但他会想办法的，放心。别担心，开心点。}
#{124}{}{I hope you didn't tell such stories your children? Wait, you're not finished?}
{124}{}{我希望你没有给你的孩子讲这样的故事？等等，你还没说完？}
#{125}{}{One story is more killing than other! Would you give me a nickel bag?}
{125}{}{一个故事比另一个故事更具杀伤力！你能给我一个五分钱的袋子吗？}
#{126}{}{I'm not in the right mood to listen about your trips. Good luck.}
{126}{}{我没心情听你说你的旅行。祝你好运。}
#{127}{}{So... Devotion - nice word, isn't it? Same opinion had one dog, which made it's way to the owner through the devastation of a nuclear holocaust and scratch along  with the surviving cats and rats. But when that dog found him...}
{127}{}{所以...奉献-很好的词，不是吗？同样的观点有一只狗，它和幸存的猫和老鼠一起经历了核浩劫的毁灭和抓挠，找到了主人。但是当那条狗找到他的时候...}
#{128}{}{Stop! Lemme guess - someone ate someone.}
{128}{}{住手！我猜-有人吃了人。}
#{129}{}{Yeah-yeah, go on. I'm eager for more.}
{129}{}{是的，继续。我渴望得到更多。}
#{130}{}{That's it, I'm done. Bye, fabler!}
{130}{}{就这样，我完了。再见，法伯！}
#{131}{}{Hm... I think I better tell a story about some lone wanderer from some vault. How you'd think I end this tale?}
{131}{}{嗯...我想我最好讲一个关于某个避难所里孤独流浪者的故事。你觉得我怎么结束这个故事？}
#{132}{}{I think it's up to wanderer how the story ends.}
{132}{}{我想故事的结局取决于流浪者。}
#{133}{}{What's the catch? Why did you keep telling me these stories? Is this some kind of test?}
{133}{}{有什么问题吗？你为什么一直告诉我这些故事？这是某种测试吗？}
#{134}{}{I don't fuckin' care! I'm tired of you already. I'm gonna leave you.}
{134}{}{我才不管呢！我已经厌倦你了。我要离开你了。}
#{135}{}{Wanderer killed some stoned old man for loot. Do you like this tale? [Attack]}
{135}{}{流浪者为了抢掠杀了一个被石头砸死的老人。你喜欢这个故事吗？[攻击]}
#{136}{}{No catch, nope. After all, we're not on bridge of death, ha-ha! Just wanna stir your mind to some determinate thoughts.}
{136}{}{没有，没有。毕竟，我们不是在死亡之桥上，哈哈！只是想让你的思绪进入一些确定的想法。}
#{137}{}{Thoughts is nothing, deeds matter. And whoever says anything, I will do whatever I think is necessary.}
{137}{}{思想不重要，行动重要。不管谁说什么，我都会做我认为必要的事。}
#{138}{}{So far my thoughts are about beating you for time spent ineptly with you. Disappear from horizon, junkie.}
{138}{}{到目前为止，我的想法是要打败你，因为我花了很多时间和你在一起。从地平线上消失，瘾君子。}
#{139}{}{Well said! Let it go as it is... You never know what's hiding behind the corner, but it's not a good reason for grim thoughts. Don't worry, be happy!}
{139}{}{说得好！顺其自然吧...你永远不知道角落里藏着什么，但这不是一个好的理由，可怕的想法。别担心，开心点！}
#{140}{}{Amen. So long, philosopher.}
{140}{}{阿门。再见，哲学家。}
#{141}{}{Whatever hides behind the corner, it's better flee from the way in fear. Be healthy, don't smoke too much.}
{141}{}{不管躲在角落里的是什么，最好在恐惧中逃离。保持健康，不要抽烟太多。}
#{142}{}{Thank you, the wisest one, for the opportunity to joint to the source knowledge. Well, I need to go.}
{142}{}{谢谢你，最聪明的一位，给了我机会，让我们一起分享知识的源头。我得走了。}
#{150}{}{Why did no one thought of selling empty cigs?}
{150}{}{为什么没人想到卖空烟？}
#{151}{}{In this wilderness, can't even smoke a joint with no one...}
{151}{}{在这片荒野里，一个人都不能抽大麻...}
#{152}{}{Life is way simpler than everyone thinks}
{152}{}{生活比大家想象的要简单得多}
#{153}{}{You were allowed to start everything from scratch - and how did you manage to ruin everything?}
{153}{}{你被允许从零开始一切-你是怎么搞砸一切的？}
#{154}{}{Like in hell - lots of killing vynils and not a single gramophone.}
{154}{}{就像在地狱里-很多杀维尼尔斯的人而没有一个留声机。}
#{155}{}{Be happy, for Pete's sake!}
{155}{}{开心点，看在皮特的份上！}
#{156}{}{Don't worry!}
{156}{}{别担心！}
