#Questions
### {220}{}{What do you sell, Flick?}
{220}{}{你卖什么，弗利克？ -- What do you sell, Flick?}
### {221}{}{I sell what I can -food, clothes, household utensils. But now I have nothing but caps left.}
{221}{}{我卖我能卖的东西――食物、衣服、家用器具。但现在我只剩下帽子了。 -- I sell what I can -food, clothes, household utensils. But now I have nothing but caps left.}
### {222}{}{What's the story with caps?}
{222}{}{戴帽子的故事是什么？ -- What's the story with caps?}
### {223}{}{Don't you know? In a big city in the east, someone thought of using caps as currency. That is, to exchange them for goods. It's a strange idea, but it's convenient! The only problem is that the Rangers do not recognize the caps and refuse to trade on them.}
{223}{}{你不知道吗？在东部的一个大城市，有人想到用上限作为货币。也就是说，用它们来交换货物。这是个奇怪的主意，但很方便！唯一的问题是流浪者队不承认上限，拒绝交易。 -- Don't you know? In a big city in the east, someone thought of using caps as currency.

### {224}{}{What kind of principle is this?}
{224}{}{这是什么样的原则？ -- What kind of principle is this?}

{225}{}{他们认为货币是一种投机行为。毕竟，你永远不知道上限的真实价格。易货交换是诚实的，不受任何形式的“通货膨胀”的影响。然而，现在很多人都有了帽子，总有一天流浪者队将被迫改变。 -- Well, they think currency is a speculative thing. After all, you never know the true price of caps.
