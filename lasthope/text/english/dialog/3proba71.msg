{100}{}{God day stranger. What can I do for you?}
{101}{}{What is this place?}
{102}{}{Can I see your stock?}
{103}{}{Nothing, later.}
#what is this...
{104}{}{This is the machine parts factory and I'm its supervisor. Name's Owen. It's the biggest factory of its kind on
 the west coast. We manufacture and sell various machine parts and tools.}
{105}{}{Who's the owner?}
{106}{}{Show me your stock.}
{107}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
#owner...
{108}{}{Mayor Donson. In fact, he owns half of the city. His investments and good management helped this city a lot.}
{109}{}{Where can I find mayor Donson?}
{110}{}{Thanks. I wanted to ask you something else.}
#find Donson...
{111}{}{His house is just across the way. If you intend to see him, keep in mind that he's a very busy man and usually
 doesn't have the time to meet people, sometimes for weeks.}
{112}{}{A very busy man you say? Thanks, I'll be on my way.}
#something else...
{113}{}{Of course. What would it be?}
#
{114}{}{Pleasure doing business with you. Come back anytime.}
{115}{}{Sure thing.}
#
{116}{}{Leonard from Duntown sent me to ask you what happened to his shipment.}
#
{117}{}{Well... it's bad, I had no idea things can go so wrong. The shipment was intercepted by a group of bandits,
 about two hundred miles from here...}
{118}{}{What happened?}
#
{119}{}{Before we even got there... we could see a wide column of smoke from a distance. Usually a bad indicator...
 but nothing could prepare us for the horror afterwards. We sensed the smell of burning flesh... and soon, the wind
 started to blow and cleared the smoke. What we saw... was terrible. Dead bodies and blood everywhere, like a real
 slaughterhouse.}
{120}{}{Damn, what happened to the shipment?}
#
{121}{}{Most of the ore containers were gone... some got left behind, probably in a hurry. They took everything else of
 value: money, weapons, personal belongings, even stripped some of the bodies... At least we know they all fought
 bravely, died from gunshot wounds...}
{122}{}{I should go tell this to Leonard, see you later.}
#
{123}{}{I want to take another look at your goods.}
#
{124}{}{Welcome back. What would it be this time?}
#
{125}{}{We don't work at night time.}
{126}{}{You should come back during day time.}
#
{127}{}{I don't support your evil cause! Get the hell out!}
{128}{}{We are closed for you, for good!}
{129}{}{I don't deal with criminals!}
#machine part for Larry...
{130}{}{Do you sell replacement parts for ore processing machines?}
#
{131}{}{Well, I have some old ones. Demand for those on the market is... rare these days. Are you looking for
 something specific or...?}
{132}{}{Uh... I don't know, the whole damn thing is just huge...}
{133}{}{Well, the processing unit works slower than usual...}
{134}{}{I think it has something to do with the control unit.}
{135}{}{Power supply unit is my best guess.}
{136}{}{I'm afraid I don't know what I'm talking about. I'll talk to you later.}
#
{137}{}{About those machine parts I need...}
#
{138}{}{Alright, what do you need?}
#
{139}{}{I'm sorry but that doesn't help at all. If you excuse me, I have other matters to attend to.}
{140}{}{Sure. I'll come back later.}
# +133,134,135...
{141}{}{I checked the control unit, it turns out there's a faulty module...}
{142}{}{Will a gun to your forehead help!?}
{143}{}{Module you say... I remember I kept one for rainy days. [Takes something, what seems to be a dusty old
 circuit board, from his locker. Looking closely at it.] This is it. Most of the control units have one of these installed,
 like the one in our water station, although it's a different type.}
{144}{}{Does it work?}
{145}{}{Are you sure this is the right module? It does look like some useless junk.}
{146}{}{Sure, how much?}
#
{147}{}{Absolutely. It's old but more important, not damaged.}
{148}{}{Fine, I'll take your word for it. How much?}
{149}{}{I'll leave it for later.}
#
{150}{}{Well, you know that old saying, one man's junk is another man's treasure. It's your call. Take it or leave it.}
#
{151}{}{$1000 for it. No bargain and no return policy.}
{152}{}{(It seems like a rip off, but it's your only option.) I'll take it.}
#14.2.2021: Looking for uranium for Aston; gvar 124 = 2 and gvar 573 < 2
{153}{}{Do you know of any uranium ore supplier?}
{154}{}{Actually, I do. I supply a nuclear power plant with replacement parts. They do use uranium, naturally, but I
 know they are also in the market of selling. Well, at least they used to be. With the ongoing caravan raids and peoples'
 growing distrust, business has become rather exclusive. Still, if you want to try and convince them they are in the
 north-east. I can show you on the map.}
{155}{}{Thanks.}
