{653}{}{我想我会远离这件事。再会。}
#{700}{}{There is a miner locked down in jail. His name is Richie. He was arrested while doing some dirty work for us. If he decides to talk, Uncle would be in big trouble. Even bigger, if it reaches Nestor's ears. What I need from you is to make sure it doesn't happen.}
{700}{}{有个矿工被关在监狱里。他叫里奇。他在为我们干脏活时被捕了。如果他决定谈谈，叔叔会有大麻烦的。甚至更大，如果它到达内斯特的耳朵。我需要你确保这不会发生。}

{702}{}{所以你想让我暗杀他？}
#{750}{}{[Cedrick nods.] If you manage to do it without drawing attention from the police, Uncle is prepared to generously reward you for your effort.}

{800}{}{我很高兴听到这个消息。做完就回来。}
#{801}{}{OK.}
{801}{}{好 啊。}
#{850}{}{Let's pretend I didn't hear that. You were looking for work and I gave you one. You just make sure to finish it quickly. If you don't take care of Richie, then there is nothing more to say between the two of us.}
{850}{}{让我们假装我没听到。你在找工作，我给了你一份。你一定要快点完成。如果你不照顾里奇，那我们俩就没什么好说的了。}

#{852}{}{As you wish.}
{852}{}{如你所愿。}
#{900}{}{[Cedrick frowns.] You thought wrong. Uncle had nothing to do with that dead mole. You are wasting your time here.}
{900}{}{[塞德里克皱眉]你想错了。叔叔和那只死鼹鼠无关。你在这里浪费时间。}
#{901}{}{Richie claimed otherwise before his untimely end. He mentioned some information that could really complicate Uncle's sweet life.}
{901}{}{里奇在他不合时宜的结束之前声称不是这样。他提到了一些可能使叔叔的甜蜜生活复杂化的信息。}
#{902}{}{In that case, let's forget about it.}
{902}{}{既然如此，我们还是算了吧。}
#{903}{}{As if I was stupid enough to believe that, asshole! You'll die for this lie!}
{903}{}{好像我傻到相信了，混蛋！你会为这个谎言而死的！}
#{950}{}{Very well, I see where you're getting at. I have a proposition for you. How about I give you 600 caps and you forget all about your talk with Richie?}
{950}{}{很好，我明白你的意思了。我有个建议给你。我给你600个瓶盖，你就把跟里奇的谈话全忘了？}
#{951}{}{What talk with Richie?}
{951}{}{你和里奇谈什么？}
#{952}{}{You cannot buy my silence.}
{952}{}{你买不到我的沉默。}
#{1000}{}{[He gives you the money, smiling.] I'm happy you're reasonable. Listen, would you like to work for Uncle? Just now, he's in need of a smart person like you.}
{1000}{}{[他微笑着给你钱]我很高兴你讲道理。听着，你愿意为叔叔工作吗？刚才，他需要一个像你这样聪明的人。}

#{1002}{}{How can I be of help?}
{1002}{}{我能帮什么忙？}
#{1050}{}{It seems you don't know who you're dealing with. You received a very generous offer. But, if you're refusing to accept it, I am forced to secure your silence in another way. [He strokes his gun gently with his fingers.] I hope you get the idea now.}
{1050}{}{你好像不知道你在和谁打交道。你得到了一个非常慷慨的提议。但是，如果你拒绝接受，我不得不用另一种方式保证你的沉默。[他用手指轻轻地划着枪]我希望你现在明白了。}
#{1051}{}{Absolutely. I'd rather take the caps.}
{1051}{}{当然。我宁愿拿瓶盖。}
#{1052}{}{Absolutely. I'd rather take the caps.}
{1052}{}{当然。我宁愿拿瓶盖。}
#{1053}{}{Are you threatening me? You'll pay for this!}
{1053}{}{你在威胁我吗？你要为此付出代价！}
#{1100}{}{The miners went on strike. They refuse to work unless Nestor improves the lousy working conditions in the mine. It's a wonderful opportunity to hit the little bastard where it'll hurt the most. The strike itself doesn't mean much, but an open rebellion is hanging in the air. If that happens, it will mean real trouble for Nestor, especially with the sheriff. If you manage to start the revolt somehow, Uncle certainly won't be cheap with your reward.}
{1100}{}{矿工们罢工了。除非内斯特改善矿井恶劣的工作条件，否则他们拒绝工作。这是一个很好的机会去打一个小混蛋，在他最受伤的地方。罢工本身意义不大，但公开的叛乱仍悬而未决。如果发生这种情况，对内斯特来说将是真正的麻烦，尤其是对警长。如果你想办法发动叛乱，叔叔肯定不会吝啬你的赏金的。}
#{1101}{}{I'll see what I can do.}
{1101}{}{我看看我能做什么。}
#{1150}{}{Wait buddy. [He gives you an appraising look.] To kill someone right in the joint takes some kind of guts. Listen, wouldn't you like to work for Uncle? Just now he could use a capable guy like you.}
{1150}{}{等等，伙计。[他给了你一个评价的眼神]在关节处杀人需要一些勇气。听着，你不想为叔叔工作吗？刚才他需要你这样能干的人。}

#{1152}{}{What is the deal?}
{1152}{}{怎么回事？}
#{1200}{}{And who sent you? Don't tell me that you're here on your own accord. And what about your reason, do you have a reason at all? If you haven't heard, you can't challenge anyone without one.}
{1200}{}{谁派你来的？别告诉我你是自愿来的。那你的理由呢，你有理由吗？如果你没有听说过，你不能挑战任何人。}

{1202}{}{我不在乎什么原因。我要杀了你们所有人。}

{1206}{}{你知道吗，算了吧。再见。}
#{1250}{}{That little son of bitch again. [He grins.] When you are dying in the ring, you will realize that working for him was the worst decision in your life.}

#{1251}{}{We'll see about that. [Go to the ring.]}

#{1301}{}{Eh?!}
{1301}{}{嗯？！}
#{1350}{}{Oh, I get it now, you were kicked in the head too much as a kid, right? [He gives you an appraising look.] But I see that you have other gifts to compensate that. Listen, would you like to be my deputy in the ring? Just now I need one.}

{1352}{}{哇！？}
#{1400}{}{Eh, it's no big deal. You would just have to fight in the ring and even get paid for it. What do you say?}
{1400}{}{呃，没什么大不了的。你只需要在拳击场上战斗，甚至为此付出代价。你怎么说？}
#{1401}{}{Oukeey, yaaa!}
{1401}{}{哦，耶！}
#{1402}{}{Nooo! Bay.}

{3052}{}{我懂了。谢谢你的消息。再见，塞德里克。}
#{3100}{}{[Cedrick grins malevolently.] That's what he told you, didn't he? Don't believe it. Vodka is responsible for his own misfortune. Most likely he put his house on fire in drunken delirium. He couldn't handle his drinking just as he couldn't handle the move to Corath. Maybe he used to be a good guard of the caravans, but he wasn't good for anything else. Uncle would fire him anyway, even if he didn't mutilate himself like he did. If not for his infatuation, he would accept it a long time ago. Let him live with his delusions.}
{3100}{}{[塞德里克恶狠狠地笑了笑]他就是这么跟你说的，不是吗？别相信。伏特加是他自己不幸的罪魁祸首。很可能是他酒后神志不清，把房子烧了。他不能控制自己的饮酒，就像他不能控制自己搬到科拉斯一样。也许他曾经是一个很好的商队警卫，但他不擅长其他任何事情。不管怎样，叔叔都会解雇他，即使他不像以前那样残害自己。如果不是他的迷恋，他早就接受了。让他忍受自己的妄想吧。}
#{3101}{}{That's what you say. Bye.}
{3101}{}{你就是这么说的。再见。}
#{3150}{}{[Cedrick grins.] Strong words coming from the one responsible for all those deaths, don't you think? I'll give your message to Uncle.

Do not make a habit of it or I would have to be in an elated state to forgive you again.}
{3150}{}{[塞德里克咧嘴一笑]你不觉得那些死亡的罪魁祸首说了些强硬的话吗？我把你的口信给叔叔。对你来说，如果你不再在这里闲逛，那就最好了。这次我要原谅你无礼的态度。不要养成这样的习惯，否则我就得兴高采烈地再次原谅你。}
