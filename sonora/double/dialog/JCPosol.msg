### {211}{}{It's hard, but progress is tangible. The first thing you need is to appease the Jackals with a small present of provisions. And then we will teach them to lead a civilized way of life.}
{211}{}{这很难，但进步是实实在在的。你需要的第一件事是用一小份食物来安抚豺狼。然后我们将教会他们过文明的生活。 -- It's hard, but progress is tangible. The first thing you need is to appease the Jackals with a small present of provisions. And then we will teach them to lead a civilized way of life.}
### {212}{}{What do you think? Someone broke all the plans by killing the Jackals. It remains to be hoped that these savages will not scatter across Sonora and Mojave in search of new victims.}
{212}{}{你觉得怎么样？有人杀了豺狼，破坏了所有的计划。人们仍然希望这些野蛮人不会分散在索诺拉和莫哈韦寻找新的受害者。 -- What do you think? Someone broke all the plans by killing the Jackals. It remains to be hoped that these savages will not scatter across Sonora and Mojave in search of new victims.}
### {213}{}{Will Jackals be of use?}

### {214}{}{Rangers can learn tactics and survival from them. And they can also be used to monitor the terrain. It's already worth a lot.

{214}{}{流浪者可以从中学习战术和生存。它们也可以用来监视地形。它已经很值钱了。但我担心他们愚蠢的原则――吃人、相信避难精神、地下生活方式和其他无稽之谈。这需要很长时间才能消除。 -- Rangers can learn tactics and survival from them. And they can also be used to monitor the terrain.

### {215}{}{How do you feel about an alliance with Jackals?}
{215}{}{你觉得和豺狼联盟怎么样？ -- How do you feel about an alliance with Jackals?}
### {216}{}{A difficult question. Many are dissatisfied with the concessions and believe that the Jackals should simply be eliminated. From this, the reputation of the Rangers was a little shaken. But after communicating with the tribe, I realized that this is not the way out. Their "flock" is scattered throughout the Mojave Desert and further west. By eliminating this lair, we will only anger the other clans. It's like throwing a stone into a river to change its course.}
{216}{}{一个难题。许多人对这些让步感到不满，认为应该简单地淘汰豺狼队。由此，流浪者队的声誉有点动摇。但在与部落沟通后，我意识到这不是出路。他们的“羊群”散布在莫哈韦沙漠和更远的西部。通过消除这个巢穴，我们只会激怒其他部族。这就像把一块石头扔到河里改变它的路线。 -- A difficult question. Many are dissatisfied with the concessions and believe that the Jackals should simply be eliminated. From this, the reputation of the Rangers was a little shaken. But after communicating with the tribe, I realized that this is not the way out. Their "flock" is scattered throughout the Mojave Desert and further west.

### {217}{}{Why *in fact* did the Rangers agree to the alliance?}
{217}{}{事实上，为什么游骑兵队同意联盟？ -- Why *in fact* did the Rangers agree to the alliance?}
### {218}{}{Obviously, there are other motives besides your diplomacy. Jackals have been terrorizing this district for many years. But there are no other ways to the north. Rangers have a special interest in the northern lands, it's a long story. In addition, the tribe can become a means of pressure on the surrounding settlements.}
{218}{}{显然，除了你的外交手段，还有其他动机。多年来，豺狼一直在恐吓这个地区。但是去北方没有别的路。游骑兵队对北方的土地特别感兴趣，这是一个很长的故事。此外，部落可以成为对周围定居点施加压力的手段。 -- Obviously, there are other motives besides your diplomacy. Jackals have been terrorizing this district for many years. But there are no other ways to the north. Rangers have a special interest in the northern lands, it's a long story.

### {219}{}{So far I haven't even managed to meet with the manager. I think these negotiations will not get off the ground without your help.}
{219}{}{到目前为止，我甚至还没能见到经理。我认为，如果没有你的帮助，这些谈判就不会开始。 -- So far I haven't even managed to meet with the manager. I think these negotiations will not get off the ground without your help.}
