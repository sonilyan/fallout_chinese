#{100}{}{You see the quartermaster.}
{100}{}{你看到军需官了。}
#{101}{}{You see a simple laborer in the warehouse. He is lazy and appears to be suffering from hemorrhoids.}
{101}{}{你看到仓库里有个简单的工人。他很懒，好像得了痔疮。}
#{102}{}{You can??t just walk here! Go to around in through the corridor...}
{102}{}{你不能就这么走在这里！穿过走廊到处走...}
#{110}{}{What do you want?}
{110}{}{你想要什么？}
#{111}{}{It's a warehouse, right? Is there anything here from this list?}
{111}{}{是个仓库，对吧？这张单子上有什么吗？}
#{112}{}{Nothing.}
{112}{}{没有什么。}
#{113}{}{We have only the pressure regulator from the list, a whole wagon of them! They just lay around, collecting dust, with no use. No one to pawn it off to.}
{113}{}{我们只有名单上的压力调节器，整整一车！他们只是躺在那里，收集灰尘，没有用。没人把它当掉。}
#{114}{}{So maybe, you can share with me, if they are useless anyway?}
{114}{}{所以也许，你可以和我分享，如果他们是无用的呢？}
#{115}{}{Well, not for free. I think one missing regulator won??t hurt anyone, but food on the other hand is a rarity, we don??t get paid much, you know. So make your mind, I can sell it for 500$ or trade for 10 pizzas from the Phillips' cafe.}
{115}{}{不是免费的。我认为一个监管机构的缺失不会伤害到任何人，但另一方面，食物是一种稀罕物，你知道，我们的工资不高。所以请你决定，我可以以500美元的价格卖掉它，或者以菲利普斯咖啡馆的10个比萨饼的价格交易。}
#{116}{}{What about Nuka-Cola? I do supply people with it and I can bring at least a full box.}
{116}{}{那努卡可乐呢？我确实给人们提供了它，而且我至少可以带满一盒。}
#{117}{}{I've got just as many pizzas as you need. Here, take it.}
{117}{}{我有你需要的比萨饼。来，拿着。}
#{118}{}{Here are 10 pizzas, as agreed.}
{118}{}{按照约定，这里有10个比萨饼。}
#{119}{}{Here's the money, now give me the device.}
{119}{}{给你钱，把设备给我。}
#{120}{}{[Greedily grabs the money and hides in the bosom, looks around and gets a pressure regulator] Here. But carefully, no one should notice.}
{120}{}{[贪婪地抓着钱藏在怀里，环顾四周，找了个压力调节器]这里。但小心点，没人会注意到。}
#{121}{}{Uh-huh, okay.}
{121}{}{啊哈，好吧。}
#{122}{}{That's what I call service! So, now I'm going to get the regulator, but when you'll take it out, watch out, so no one notices.}
{122}{}{这就是我所说的服务！所以，现在我要去找监管者，但是当你把它拿出来的时候，小心，所以没人注意到。}
#{123}{}{Really? Well, if you're a supplier of factory, then why not! 250 bottles - and the regulator's yours.}
{123}{}{真正地？好吧，如果你是工厂的供应商，那为什么不呢！250瓶-调节剂是你的。}
#{124}{}{How strange the number of bottles I have is just enough. I carry them on me just in case, you know...}
{124}{}{奇怪的是，我有这么多瓶子。我把它们带在身上以防万一，你知道...}
#{125}{}{I have the right amount in the warehouses in this city. I will bring them to you...}
{125}{}{我在这个城市的仓库里有合适的数量。我会把它们带给你...}
#{126}{}{I don't have so much in a local warehouse. Will have to wait.}
{126}{}{我在当地的仓库里没有那么多。得等一下。}
#{127}{}{I'll consider the offer. Bye.}
{127}{}{我会考虑这个提议的。再见。}
#{128}{}{You're a like a brahmin tractor! Now I have to find where to put it all, so the others wouldn't see... Ah yes, here is the regulator. But carefully, no one should notice.}
{128}{}{你就像个双头牛拖拉机！现在我得把这些都放在哪里，这样其他人就看不到了...啊，是的，这是调节器。但小心点，没人会注意到。}
#{129}{}{Of course...}
{129}{}{当然...}
#{130}{}{As you want. After all, you suggested it yourself.}
{130}{}{随你的便。毕竟，这是你自己提出来的。}
#{131}{}{Bye.}
{131}{}{再见。}
#{132}{}{[You bring required quantity of Nuka-Cola from warehouse to the cafe.] }
{132}{}{[您将所需数量的Nuka可乐从仓库带到咖啡馆。]}
#{133}{}{Have you thought about my offer? It is still stands.}
{133}{}{你考虑过我的提议吗？它仍然屹立不倒。}
#{134}{}{Remind me, what have you asked for in return?}
{134}{}{提醒我，你要求什么作为回报？}
#{135}{}{No, not yet.}
{135}{}{不，还没有。}
#{136}{}{Choose - I can sell the thing for 500$ or trade for 10 pizzas from the Phillips' cafe.}
{136}{}{选择-我可以卖500美元的东西或交易10个比萨饼从菲利普斯的咖啡馆。}
