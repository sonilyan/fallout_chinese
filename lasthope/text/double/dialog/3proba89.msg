{100}{}{Welcome, customer. The name is Samuel. This is my store "Weapons & Ammo". So, are you interested in
 buying some of my finest weapons?}
{101}{}{Show me your merchandise.}
{102}{}{Can you upgrade or modify some weapons?}
{103}{}{No thanks.}
#upgrade...
{104}{}{I can fix almost anything for you, sir. I can do several upgrades for small arms and rifles. If you need
 modifications, show me what you have.}
{105}{}{OK, take a look.}
{106}{}{Actually, I wanted to ask you something.}
#Something...
{107}{}{Of course, my dear customer. Anything you need.}
#upgrade nema nista...
{108}{}{Sorry, you got nothing I can work with. Can I do something else for you?}
{109}{}{Let me ask you something.}
{110}{}{Nothing, I'm out of here.}
#
{111}{}{Welcome again, customer. What can I offer you today?}
{112}{}{Nothing, thanks.}
#
{113}{}{Nice doing business with you. Come back again.}
{114}{}{Sure thing.}
#
{115}{}{You'll find nothing of interest there.}
{116}{}{Hands off!}
{117}{}{Don't touch that.}
#
{126}{}{I can modify that 10mm pistol you have, for about $450.}
{127}{}{Sure, here you go. [Give him the money.]}
{128}{}{That's too much for me. I'll be back when I have the money.}
#
{129}{}{Alright, it's done. Take your time to test it. I can't guarantee it will work perfectly but I can assure you,
 when I do the job, you won't be back for a long time.}
{130}{}{Alright. Bye.}
#
{131}{}{That hunting rifle could be upgraded. I can put a scope on it. It will improve your chances of hitting distant
 objects compared to the regular rifle. It will cost you just $500.}
#
{132}{}{That desert eagle you have... I could give it an expanded magazine for only $200.}
#
{133}{}{Your magnum looks like it could use some adjustments. You can purchase a speed loader for it, only $250.}
#
{134}{}{I can upgrade your pipe rifle, adding one extra gun barrel to it. Weapon will gain some weight but it will do
 more damage even with regular 10mm JHP. This adjustment will cost you $550.}
#
{135}{}{Sorry, I've used up all my tools and materials.}
{136}{}{Alright, can I ask you something?}
#
{137}{}{What can you tell me about this place?}
#
{138}{}{It used to be an old storage room for coal and now I rent it. The best part is, I have to live in this
 filth. I actually pay money to our dear mayor just to let us sleep on the boxes and wake up with the refreshing smell
 of mold and rat droppings. And that's how my working day starts...}
{139}{}{Oh, it can't be that bad... let me ask you something else.}
#
{140}{}{I told you. If you like sleeping on cardboard and start enjoying the smell, you'll get used to it splendidly. Ah,
 who am I kidding... feels like modern middle ages...}
#
{141}{}{What about this place?}
