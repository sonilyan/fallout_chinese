{103}{}{不是现在！我得对付大厅里的这些混蛋。}
#{110}{}{Hey, I'm the boss of this establishment. What are you doing here?}

#{115}{}{Seems like I got into the wrong place...}

{116}{}{另一个！太好了。。。拳击场的入口是从街上进来的！在大楼的另一边，你听见了吗？！}

#{122}{}{You have a big mouth, buddy. Watch it.}
{122}{}{你嘴巴真大，伙计。小心点。}
#{123}{}{You want to say that it has nothing to do with you, huh? I advise you to think again, I'm here not for social calls.}
{123}{}{你想说这跟你没关系吧？我建议你再想想，我不是来应酬的。}
#{124}{}{So it's a threat?! I guess, I will strike first then. Look!}
{124}{}{所以这是个威胁？！我想，我会先动手的。你看！}
#{125}{}{Oh, okay, I will. You know, you said that in a somewhat scary way.}
{125}{}{哦，好吧，我会的。你知道吗，你说这话有点吓人。}
#{126}{}{Huh? And why should I answer your questions?}
{126}{}{呵呵？我为什么要回答你的问题？}
#{127}{}{Because, by the order of the mayor, I'm investigating the recent crimes in the city.}
{127}{}{因为，根据市长的命令，我正在调查这个城市最近的犯罪。}
#{128}{}{I have personal reasons.}
{128}{}{我有个人原因。}
#{129}{}{Fair enough. You need to answer with blood! So answer me, bitch!}
{129}{}{很公平。你要用鲜血来回答！回答我，婊子！}
#{130}{}{If you don't want, don't answer.}

#{131}{}{Ha, my friend, well, then I have a dozen reasons to get you to shut up... [pulls out a gun and smiles as if nothing happened]}
{131}{}{哈，我的朋友，那么我有很多理由让你闭嘴。。。[掏出枪微笑着好像什么都没发生]}

#{135}{}{I want to destroy the lab.}

#{136}{}{I just want to get high! Want a lot of stuff to do it!}
{136}{}{我只想兴奋！想要很多东西来做！}
#{137}{}{Not this again... They are buying enough of slaves from us, so they won't need you.}
{137}{}{又不是这个。。。他们从我们这里买了足够的奴隶，所以他们不需要你。}
#{138}{}{Uh... Wait a minute. [enable recording on the Pip-Boy] So you're saying that you are supplying the lab with slaves, right?}
{138}{}{休斯敦大学。。。等一下。[启用Pip男孩的录音]所以你是说你在给实验室提供奴隶，对吧？}
#{139}{}{Too bad.}
{139}{}{太糟糕了。}
#{140}{}{[Looks at your Pip-Boy] But... Nobody will know about this conversation.}

#{141}{}{Hey, Hey, Hey! I'm just asking!}
{141}{}{嘿，嘿，嘿！我只是问问！}
#{142}{}{I don't care. It's none of my business..}
{142}{}{我不在乎。这不关我的事。。}
#{143}{}{Reeeally doubtful...}
{143}{}{我真的很怀疑。。。}
#{144}{}{Those guys don't deal that stuff in retail, so don't even think about it. There are a couple of their outlets in the city. Go to caravaneers, their couriers have settled there. Another one hangs out near "Hard Rock" cafe. That's it, get out of here. The junkies don't belong in here. We have enough of our own.}
{144}{}{那些家伙不做零售生意，所以你想都别想。他们在城里有几家分店。去商队，他们的信使已经在那里定居了。另一个在“硬石”咖啡馆附近。就这样，离开这里。吸毒者不属于这里。我们自己的已经够多了。}
#{145}{}{Uh... Wait a minute. [enable recording on the Pip-Boy] So do you know where this lab is located, right?}
{145}{}{休斯敦大学。。。等一下。你知道这个实验室在哪里吗？}
#{146}{}{Okay, I will look out.}

#{147}{}{Can I first know what these slaves are meant for?}
{147}{}{我能先知道这些奴隶是干什么的吗？}
#{148}{}{Heavy physical labor.}
{148}{}{繁重的体力劳动。}
#{149}{}{Hmm... Is it possible to be more specific?}
{149}{}{隐马尔可夫模型。。。有没有可能更具体一点？}
#{150}{}{I can't tell.}
{150}{}{我不知道。}
#{151}{}{Is that so? Then I can't sell. Ha!}
{151}{}{是这样吗？那我就卖不出去了。哈！}
#{152}{}{Stop bluffing, the money is at stake! Your job is to obtain the money in exchange for slaves, the rest does not matter. So hurry up or you'll lose a client.}
{152}{}{别虚张声势了，要钱了！你的工作是用奴隶换取金钱，其余的都无所谓。所以快点，否则你会失去一个客户的。}
#{153}{}{Well, too bad.}
{153}{}{好吧，太糟糕了。}
#{154}{}{Damn, you're well-spoken. You see, I learned that the Hoover dam lacks the workers lately. And, sooner or later, the chief of the dam will come to us... So, convince me, why should I sell the slaves to *you* rather than him.}
{154}{}{妈的，你说得真好。你看，我知道胡佛大坝最近缺少工人。而且，总有一天，大坝的负责人会来找我们。。。所以，说服我，我为什么要把奴隶卖给你而不是他。}
#{155}{}{As I understand, there are people in the city fighting to control the dam...}
{155}{}{据我所知，城里有人在为控制大坝而战斗。。。}
#{156}{}{Ugh. Well, it's too complicated. I'm not going to convince you.}
{156}{}{啊。嗯，太复杂了。我不会说服你的。}
#{157}{}{Well, then I'll try to catch lady Luck's tits.}
{157}{}{好吧，那我就去抓幸运女神的乳头。}
#{158}{}{Okay. I hope you'll change your mind.}
{158}{}{可以。我希望你改变主意。}
#{159}{}{Damn, true say! Okay, by our price, for fifty slaves you will have to pay ten thousand.}
{159}{}{该死，说真的！好吧，按我们的价格，五十个奴隶你得付一万。}
#{160}{}{I have just the right amount.}
{160}{}{我的量正好。}
#{161}{}{Not now then.}
{161}{}{现在不行。}
#{162}{}{About the slaves. I got 10 thousands and I'm ready to make a deal.}
{162}{}{关于奴隶。我有一万，我准备做笔交易。}
#{163}{}{You purchased a shipment of slaves for the Hoover dam. The only thing left is to inform Bob Neil.}
{163}{}{你为胡佛大坝买了一批奴隶。唯一剩下的就是通知鲍勃・尼尔。}
#{164}{}{Great deal. The slaves will wait in our corral, it's here, nearby. Just send your employees here to pick them up. And here is the receipt, to prove that everything was fair.}
{164}{}{太好了。奴隶们会在我们的畜栏里等着，就在这里，就在附近。派你的员工来接他们就行了。这是收据，证明一切都是公平的。}
#{165}{}{All right.}
{165}{}{好吧。}
#{170}{}{What's going on here? Answer me!}
{170}{}{这是怎么回事？回答我！}
#{171}{}{Uh, boss, we don't know what it was!}
{171}{}{呃，头儿，我们不知道是什么！}
#{172}{}{What does that mean?!}
{172}{}{什么意思？！}
#{173}{}{We don't know, boss! Nobody has run away, everything is under control!}
{173}{}{我们不知道，老大！没有人逃跑，一切都在控制之中！}
#{174}{}{Then what's that screaming about the escape I hear over the radio!?}
{174}{}{那我从收音机里听到的逃跑的尖叫是什么声音！？}
#{175}{}{Perhaps, one of the patrol's idea of a joke...}
{175}{}{也许，巡逻队的一个笑话。。。}
#{176}{}{When I find him, I'll personally bury him alive!}
{176}{}{等我找到他，我会亲自把他活埋！}
#{177}{}{Sure, boss.}
{177}{}{当然，老板。}
#{178}{}{Hey, why are you still here!? Quickly find that joker!}
{178}{}{嘿，你怎么还在这儿！？快找到那个小丑！}
#{179}{}{Um... Boss, but how do we find him?}
{179}{}{嗯。。。头儿，我们怎么找到他？}
#{180}{}{Uh-h, you are just a bunch of boneheads! I hate you all so much!}
{180}{}{呃，你只是一群白痴！我太恨你们了！}
#{181}{}{Um... Boss...}
{181}{}{嗯。。。头儿。。。}
#{182}{}{Also, count the slaves, you pecks!}
{182}{}{还有，数一数奴隶，你们这些胆小鬼！}
#{183}{}{Whatever you say, boss.}
{183}{}{不管你说什么，老大。}
#{184}{}{::grumbles::}
{184}{}{●抱怨：}
#{185}{}{Anyone can lay their hands on it. Will you be able to make your deal in time? Hmm, but my coin is *guaranteed*, think about it.}
{185}{}{任何人都可以动手。你能及时成交吗？嗯，但是我的硬币是有保证的，想想看。}
#{186}{}{So what?}
{186}{}{那又怎么样？}
#{1115}{}{Seems, I got into the wrong place...}
{1115}{}{看来，我进错地方了。。。}
#{1119}{}{Uh, understood...}
{1119}{}{呃，明白了。。。}
#{1122}{}{You have a big mouth, gal. Watch it.}
{1122}{}{你有张大嘴，姑娘。小心点。}
#{1131}{}{Ha, my friend, well, then I have a dozen reasons to get you to shut up... [pulls out a gun and smiles as if nothing happened]}
{1131}{}{哈，我的朋友，那么我有很多理由让你闭嘴。。。[掏出枪微笑着好像什么都没发生]}
#{1141}{}{Hey, hey, hey! I'm just asking!}
{1141}{}{嘿，嘿，嘿！我只是问问！}
