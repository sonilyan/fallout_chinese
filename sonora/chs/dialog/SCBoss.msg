{214}{}{啊，终于。他们说最近在凤凰城发生的事情应该让我高兴。看，快递员，别让人失望。}

{215}{}{没错，将军。}
### {216}{}{I'll try, General.}
{216}{}{我会尽力的，将军。}
### {217}{}{But I also wonder why Ulysses chose YOU to report? This is a responsible matter, he would not entrust it to a simple crook. Tell me about yourself, who are you and what do you have to do with sectarians in Phoenix?}
{217}{}{但我也想知道为什么尤利西斯选择你来报道？这是一件负责任的事情，他不会把它托付给一个简单的骗子。告诉我你自己，你是谁，你和凤凰城的宗派主义者有什么关系？}
### {218}{}{I have a long history, General. I'm from a village in the north. You've hardly heard of her.}
{218}{}{我有很长的历史，将军。我来自北方的一个村庄。你几乎没听说过她。}
### {219}{}{A village? So are you growing something? Or are you engaged in hunting and gathering?}
{219}{}{一个村庄？你在种什么？或者你从事狩猎和采集？}
### {220}{}{We cultivate the land and grow maize. But recently there have been problems with colonizers from Flagstaff...}
{220}{}{我们耕种土地，种植玉米。但最近弗拉格斯塔夫的殖民者出现了问题...}
### {221}{}{Ah, that's it. I have already been informed that there is a shortage of labor in the uranium mines. Well, the costs are inevitable. It's not fucking fair, son.}
{221}{}{啊，就是这样。我已经接到通知，铀矿里劳动力短缺。嗯，成本是不可避免的。这他妈的不公平，儿子。}
### {1221}{}{Ah, that's it. I have already been informed that there is a shortage of labor in the uranium mines. Well, the costs are inevitable. It's damn unfair, lady.}
{1221}{}{啊，就是这样。我已经接到通知，铀矿里劳动力短缺。嗯，成本是不可避免的。这太不公平了，女士。}
### {222}{}{That's right, General. Terribly unfair.}
{222}{}{没错，将军。非常不公平。}
### {223}{}{I was sent by Hard from Two-Sun for service. Here is his recommendation.}
{223}{}{我是从两个太阳派来的。这是他的推荐信。}
### {224}{}{Hard must have a really good reason for your recommendation. I heard that there have been major changes in Two-Sun recently? But tell me about yourself, who are you and how did you earn such trust among tinkerers?}
{224}{}{Hard一定有很好的理由推荐你。听说《两个太阳》最近有大的变化？但请告诉我你自己，你是谁？你是如何在锡匠中赢得如此信任的？}
### {1224}{}{Hard must have a really good reason for your recommendation. I heard that there have been major changes in Two-Sun recently? But tell me about yourself, who are you and how have you earned such trust among tinkerers?}
{1224}{}{Hard一定有很好的理由推荐你。听说《两个太阳》最近有大的变化？但请告诉我你自己，你是谁？你是如何在锡匠中赢得如此信任的？}
### {225}{}{The Rangers sent me. They want to stop you, but I'm interested in listening to both sides.}
{225}{}{游骑兵队派我来了。他们想阻止你，但我有兴趣听取双方的意见。}
### {226}{}{Ha, we know the Rangers are scouting. But I respect your courage. Tell me, what did the Rangers promise you in exchange for our secrets?}
{226}{}{哈，我们知道游骑兵队正在侦察。但我尊重你的勇气。告诉我，游骑兵队用什么来交换我们的秘密？}
### {227}{}{Actually, they promised freedom and protection of my native village.}
{227}{}{事实上，他们承诺自由和保护我的家乡。}
### {228}{}{I am here because you are responsible for the troubles of my village. Because of your craving for energy sources, the Flagstaff colony enslaves villages like ours.}
{228}{}{我来这里是因为你要为我村的麻烦负责。由于你对能源的渴望，弗拉格斯塔夫殖民地奴役了像我们这样的村庄。}
### {229}{}{I demand freedom and independence for my native village.}
{229}{}{我要求我的家乡获得自由和独立。}
### {230}{}{Perhaps you dream of freedom for your village? So that the bandits do not disturb your brother, and the maize grows without blood and sweat.}
{230}{}{也许你梦想着你的村庄获得自由？这样土匪就不会打扰你的兄弟，玉米也不会流血流汗。}
### {231}{}{Is that possible, General?}
{231}{}{有可能吗，将军？}
### {232}{}{Of course, General.}
{232}{}{当然，将军。}
### {233}{}{The Brotherhood of Steel knows how to get justice. We are the only ones who have preserved the wisdom of the Old World.}
{233}{}{钢铁兄弟会知道如何伸张正义。我们是唯一保存了旧世界智慧的人。}
### {234}{}{It's hard to argue with that.}
{234}{}{这很难说。}
### {235}{}{Really?}
{235}{}{真正地}
### {236}{}{If your village needs freedom, then join our Brotherhood. We will protect the Villa from enemies and help with technology. In exchange, of course, for a small surplus crop. But no creature in Arizona will dare to encroach on your sacred freedom.}
{236}{}{如果你的村庄需要自由，那就加入我们的兄弟会吧。我们将保护别墅免受敌人的攻击，并在技术方面提供帮助。当然，作为交换的是少量的剩余作物。但亚利桑那州的任何生物都不敢侵犯你神圣的自由。}
### {237}{}{But we know almost nothing about your Brotherhood.}
{237}{}{但我们对你的兄弟会几乎一无所知。}
### {238}{}{Too loud a speech, General. What kind of Brotherhood are you anyway?}
{238}{}{太大声了，将军。你是什么样的兄弟会？}
### {239}{}{The Brotherhood of Steel is an ancient order. We are collecting and reviving technologies and knowledge that were lost after the Great War. For a long time we hid in the shadow of history, studying the situation and gathering strength. And now the end of our isolation has come. The brotherhood came out of its bunker a few years ago. Our scribes will tell you the details.}
{239}{}{钢铁兄弟会是一个古老的组织。我们正在收集和复兴二战后失去的技术和知识。很长一段时间以来，我们都躲在历史的阴影中，研究形势，凝聚力量。现在我们的孤立已经结束了。兄弟会是几年前从地堡里出来的。我们的抄写员会告诉你细节。}
### {240}{}{.......}
{240}{}{......。}
### {241}{}{I'm just walking by and wondering if you have a job?}
{241}{}{我只是路过，想知道你是否有工作？}
### {242}{}{I don't do mercenaries. There is a special post outside for this. Now I ask you to leave our fortress immediately.}
{242}{}{我不做雇佣兵。外面有一个专门的职位。现在我请求你立即离开我们的堡垒。}
### {243}{}{Excuse me, General...}
{243}{}{对不起，将军...}
### {244}{}{OK, I'm leaving peacefully.}
{244}{}{好吧，我要平静地离开。}
### {245}{}{How are you going to change the Wastelands?}
{245}{}{你打算如何改变荒原？}
### {246}{}{But what are you trying to achieve with your expansion?}
{246}{}{但是，你想通过扩张实现什么呢？}
### {247}{}{The wastelands themselves must be reborn. We just happened to provide a little assistance. A small push that did not arise by our will. But it will give you an incentive for a big move. Tell me, surely people still work manually in your Villa, don't they?}
{247}{}{荒原本身必须重生。我们只是碰巧提供了一点帮助。一个并非出于我们意愿的小小推动。但这会给你一个大动作的激励。告诉我，你的别墅里肯定还有人手动工作，不是吗？}
### {248}{}{[Nod]}
{248}{}{[点头]}
### {249}{}{Imagine how the village will change if we bring water pumps, generators and new tools there. Not to mention medicine and means of protection from bandits.}
{249}{}{想象一下，如果我们把水泵、发电机和新工具带到那里，这个村庄会发生什么变化。更不用说药物和抵御土匪的手段了。}
### {250}{}{You will simply occupy us and force us to work for the good of the Brotherhood. This is not freedom.}
{250}{}{你只会占领我们，强迫我们为兄弟会的利益而工作。这不是自由。}
### {251}{}{In that case, I'm wasting my time trying to be nice to you. Your village WILL supply us with food even against its own will. You had a chance to choose an easy path, but this chance is missed. Put down your weapons and put your hands up.}
{251}{}{那样的话，我就是在浪费时间对你好。你们的村庄会为我们提供食物，即使违背了自己的意愿。你本有机会选择一条轻松的道路，但这次机会错过了。放下武器，举起双手。}
### {252}{}{Uh, don't, General...}
{252}{}{不要，将军...}
### {253}{}{The hell with it. You will not intimidate the free peasant people.}
{253}{}{见鬼去吧。你不会恐吓自由的农民的。}
### {254}{}{Sounds amazing. I'll talk to the elders.}
{254}{}{听起来很神奇。我会和长辈们谈谈。}
### {255}{}{A reasonable solution, mi querido amigo. However, even with the consent of your community, there is one significant obstacle - the rangers prevent us from developing in the northern direction, and also sabotage the world around Phoenix. And we are just conducting reconnaissance in their lands to pacify these self-styled robbers.}
{255}{}{一个合理的解决方案，我的朋友。然而，即使得到了你们社区的同意，也有一个重大障碍――护林员阻止我们向北方发展，也破坏了凤凰城周围的世界。我们只是在他们的土地上进行侦察，以安抚这些自封的强盗。}
### {256}{}{Then they need to be eliminated. Their lands just lie in my way.}
{256}{}{然后他们需要被淘汰。他们的土地挡住了我的去路。}
### {257}{}{I like to be understood from the first word. Find the Ranger base and scout there. As far as I know, they use the old dam as a fort. One crack is enough to destroy it. Act.}
{257}{}{我喜欢从第一个单词就被理解。找到游骑兵基地并在那里侦察。据我所知，他们把旧水坝当作堡垒。一个裂缝就足以摧毁它。行动起来。}
### {258}{}{It will be done, General!}
{258}{}{一定会成功的，将军！}
### {259}{}{Whatever you say, Mr. Dixon.}
{259}{}{不管你说什么，迪克森先生。}
### {260}{}{Here we are, you fucking bastard. I knew you'd come here someday. Yes, the whole of Arizona is crying for you already.}
{260}{}{我们来了，你这个混蛋。我就知道你总有一天会来这里。是的，整个亚利桑那州都在为你哭泣。}
### {1260}{}{Here we are, you fucking bitch. I knew you'd come here someday. Yes, the whole of Arizona is crying for you already.}
{1260}{}{我们来了，你这个婊子养的。我就知道你总有一天会来这里。是的，整个亚利桑那州都在为你哭泣。}

{261}{}{我们来了，你这个混蛋。我就知道你总有一天会来这里。是的，整个亚利桑那州都在谈论你。}

{1261}{}{我们来了，你这个婊子养的。我就知道你总有一天会来这里。是的，整个亚利桑那州都在谈论你。}
### {262}{}{How do you know about me?}
{262}{}{你怎么知道我的？}
### {263}{}{Naive Redneck, do you really think that your antics will go unnoticed? We have enough ears in the wastelands to know all the most important events.}
{263}{}{天真的红脖子，你真的认为你的滑稽动作会被忽视吗？我们在荒原上有足够的耳朵来了解所有最重要的事件。}
### {1263}{}{Naive rednechka, do you really think that your antics will go unnoticed? We have enough ears in the wastelands to know all the most important events.}
{1263}{}{天真的rednechka，你真的认为你的滑稽动作会被忽视吗？我们在荒原上有足够的耳朵来了解所有最重要的事件。}
### {264}{}{And what do you think about it, General?}
{264}{}{将军，你怎么看？}
### {265}{}{I don't care. I'm here to kill you and your whole gang.}
{265}{}{我不在乎。我是来杀了你和你的整个帮派的。}
### {266}{}{Son of a bitch, do you have any idea how much work it took to create a cult in Phoenix? All this grandiose work was aimed at the revival of the city. But now the only possibility has burned down in a nuclear fire because of some handful of peasants. This is a tragedy for the whole of Arizona, damn it!}
{266}{}{狗娘养的，你知道在凤凰城创建邪教花了多少钱吗？所有这些宏伟的工程都是为了复兴这座城市。但现在唯一的可能性已经在核火灾中被烧毁，因为有少数农民。这是整个亚利桑那州的悲剧，该死！}
### {267}{}{Continue.}
{267}{}{持续}
### {268}{}{Do you know how much work we have put into an alliance with the tinsmiths? Our diplomats have shown miracles in establishing contact with them. But it was still necessary to establish caravan routes. Now everything in the Two-Sun district will die out because of you.}
{268}{}{你知道我们为与锡匠结盟做了多少工作吗？我们的外交官在与他们建立联系方面表现出了奇迹。但建立商队路线仍然是必要的。现在双阳区的一切都会因为你而消亡。}
### {269}{}{Go ahead.}
{269}{}{着手}
### {270}{}{The Flagstaff mines were a critical element in the entire system. Uranium ore provides energy, and without it, all other development in Arizona is impossible. And now this source is blocked for the coming decades. Can you imagine the scale of this tragedy?}
{270}{}{弗拉格斯塔夫矿是整个系统的一个重要组成部分。铀矿提供能源，没有它，亚利桑那州的所有其他开发都是不可能的。现在，这个来源在未来几十年内被封锁。你能想象这场悲剧的规模吗？}
### {271}{}{Continue.}
{271}{}{持续}
### {272}{}{.....}
{272}{}{...。。}
### {273}{}{Go on.}
{273}{}{继续}
### {274}{}{And now I have a question for you - what are you trying to achieve, you son of a bitch?}
{274}{}{现在我有一个问题要问你――你这个婊子养的，你想实现什么？}
### {1274}{}{And now I have a question for you - what are you trying to achieve?}
{1274}{}{现在我有一个问题要问你――你想实现什么？}
### {275}{}{Because of all this movement, my family got into a difficult situation. I am seeking freedom for my Villa.}
{275}{}{由于这场运动，我的家人陷入了困境。我正在为我的别墅寻求自由。}
### {276}{}{Maybe I would feel compassion for you, trying to find a compromise. But such a grandiose work on the establishment of social, economic and technological processes in the whole state is going down the drain because of one dirty rebellious village!}
{276}{}{也许我会同情你，试图找到一个妥协。但是，这样一项在全州建立社会、经济和技术进程的宏伟工作，却因为一个肮脏叛逆的村庄而付诸东流！}
### {277}{}{Yes, that's right. You can't take away our freedom. Something you don't like, General?}
{277}{}{是的，没错。你不能剥夺我们的自由。你不喜欢什么，将军？}
### {278}{}{You are committing a crime against local residents, hiding behind noble goals. But you didn't even ask our opinion.}
{278}{}{你在对当地居民犯下罪行，躲在崇高的目标后面。但你甚至没有征求我们的意见。}
### {279}{}{If housewives had ordered politics before the War, the world would not have been able to live a day!}
{279}{}{如果家庭主妇们在战前就下令搞政治，世界就活不下去了！}
### {280}{}{Nonsense. Housewives don't want the world to burn. And because of your intervention, Dixon, the whole of Arizona is on fire.}
{280}{}{胡说家庭主妇们不希望世界被烧毁。因为你的干预，Dixon，整个亚利桑那州都着火了。}
### {281}{}{Perhaps you're right about that, General.}
{281}{}{也许你是对的，将军。}
### {282}{}{Well, for all your antics, you should be given credit. I could not have expected that Redneck alone would be able to pull off such a complicated case. But you know, I'm ready to forgive you these crimes.}
{282}{}{好吧，对于你所有的滑稽动作，你应该得到赞扬。我没想到只有雷德内克一个人能够完成如此复杂的案件。但你知道，我准备原谅你的这些罪行。}
### {283}{}{Really?}
{283}{}{真正地}
### {284}{}{Oh, how "noble" of you.}
{284}{}{哦，你真“高尚”。}
### {285}{}{Your rebellious village will receive forgiveness and immunity from the Brotherhood. But for this to happen, it is necessary to eliminate our main competitor in Arizona - the Rangers. They say they built a fort on an old hydroelectric station. Conduct a reconnaissance and find a way to destroy their dam.}
{285}{}{你叛逆的村庄将得到兄弟会的宽恕和豁免。但要做到这一点，就必须淘汰我们在亚利桑那州的主要竞争对手――流浪者队。他们说他们在一座旧水电站上建了一座堡垒。进行侦察并找到摧毁他们水坝的方法。}
### {286}{}{The hell with two. The Rangers will protect us, and you will go to hell.}
{286}{}{两个见鬼去吧。游骑兵会保护我们，你会下地狱的。}
### {287}{}{Very sorry. So, in accordance with the laws of the Old World, you will face the death penalty for your crimes. Get ready to accept your fate, you piece of shit...}
{287}{}{非常抱歉。因此，根据旧世界的法律，你的罪行将面临死刑。准备好接受你的命运吧，你这个混蛋...}

{289}{}{但我不是罪犯...}
### {1289}{}{But I'm not a criminal...}
{1289}{}{但我不是罪犯...}
### {290}{}{If you leave us alone, then I will try to do it.}
{290}{}{如果你不理我们，我会尽力去做的。}
### {291}{}{As the supreme Paladin, I will keep my word. Act.}
{291}{}{作为至高无上的圣骑士，我会信守诺言。行为}
### {292}{}{Goodbye.}
{292}{}{再见}
### {293}{}{It is strange to hear this from the mouth of someone who is guilty of this.}
{293}{}{从一个对此有罪的人嘴里听到这句话真是奇怪。}
### {294}{}{What the hell are you talking about? We are just the final buyers of nuclear batteries. They are made by Two-Sun tinsmiths, and uranium is brought for them from Flagstaff. I am also not in the mood that the colony's leadership has fallen victim to its greed. But we have to turn a blind eye to this. We need these batteries!}
{294}{}{你到底在说什么？我们只是核电池的最后买家。它们是由两个太阳锡匠制造的，铀是从弗拉格斯塔夫运来的。我也不认为殖民地的领导层已经成为其贪婪的受害者。但我们必须对此视而不见。我们需要这些电池！}
### {295}{}{Yeah. It sounds like you're out of business. But really?}
{295}{}{是 啊听起来你好像失业了。但真的吗？}
### {296}{}{Listen, son, we're not slavers. We are an ancient noble order whose purpose is to keep order in the wastelands. And California is a complete mess right now. Right now there is a war being waged with an army of super mutants. If the Brotherhood fails to contain this green threat, it will soon get to you. Do you want this?}
{296}{}{听着，孩子，我们不是奴隶主。我们是一个古老而高尚的秩序，其目的是维护荒原上的秩序。加州现在一团糟。现在有一场战争正在与一支超级变种人大军展开。如果兄弟会不能遏制这种绿色威胁，它很快就会降临到你身上。你想要这个吗？}

### {353}{}{Okay, I'll try to ask someone else.}
{353}{}{好吧，我试着问问其他人。}
### {354}{}{General Dixon, may I ask a question about the Brotherhood?}
{354}{}{迪克森将军，我可以问一个关于兄弟会的问题吗？}
### {355}{}{We are a closed organization from California with an army charter and a great past.}
{355}{}{我们是一个来自加利福尼亚州的封闭组织，有着军队章程和伟大的过去。}
### {356}{}{It doesn't look like you're closed.}
{356}{}{看起来你没有关门。}
### {357}{}{Previously, the Brotherhood lived in an underground bunker and did not stick out of there unnecessarily. Rare heroes managed to get inside. We did not interfere in the affairs of the region, only traded and kept order in the vicinity.}
{357}{}{以前，兄弟会住在一个地下掩体里，不必要地离开那里。罕见的英雄设法进入了里面。我们没有干涉该地区的事务，只是在附近进行贸易和维持秩序。}
### {358}{}{Continue.}
{358}{}{持续}
### {359}{}{It must have been terribly boring.}
{359}{}{一定很无聊。}
### {360}{}{After some events that you probably don't know about, the elders finally decided to get out of the stuffy dungeon and start exploring the neighboring lands.}
{360}{}{在经历了一些你可能不知道的事情之后，长老们终于决定走出闷热的地牢，开始探索邻近的土地。}
### {361}{}{Now it's clear. You know, I have even more questions about the Brotherhood.}
{361}{}{现在很清楚了。你知道，我还有更多关于兄弟会的问题。}
### {362}{}{And you are glad to leave the stuffy bunker, aren't you? It looks like the Brotherhood needs fresh air.}
{362}{}{你很高兴离开闷热的地堡，不是吗？看起来兄弟会需要新鲜空气。}
### {363}{}{Thank you for your time. I dare not detain you any longer.}
{363}{}{谢谢你抽出时间。我不敢再拘留你了。}
### {364}{}{Why are you quartered in this particular port?}
{364}{}{你为什么驻扎在这个特定的港口？}
### {365}{}{This is a good place to organize an impregnable fortress. Besides, there is no reactor in the area better than our destroyer.}
{365}{}{这是一个组织坚不可摧的堡垒的好地方。此外，该地区没有比我们的驱逐舰更好的反应堆了。}
### {366}{}{I see. May I ask another question about the Brotherhood?}
{366}{}{我明白了。我可以再问一个关于兄弟会的问题吗？}

### {367}{}{Why are you interfering in the affairs of this region?}
{367}{}{你为什么要干涉这个地区的事务？}
### {368}{}{We just need resources. To get them, you need a workforce and a well-established infrastructure. None of this is here, and our little squad is not enough for this. Therefore, there is only one way - to connect the local savages by teaching them to hold a shovel straight.}
{368}{}{我们只需要资源。要获得它们，你需要一支劳动力队伍和完善的基础设施。这些都不在这里，我们的小团队还不够。因此，只有一种方法――教当地的野蛮人挺直铁锹，将他们联系起来。}
### {369}{}{Isn't there another answer?}
{369}{}{难道没有其他答案吗？}
### {370}{}{Look at your tribes. They are feuding over minor troubles. For a pathetic sip of water, they are ready to cut each other's throats. Phoenix City is envied by all the surrounding settlements, and the settlements themselves hate each other even more. These lands need a force that could unite them and direct them to the revival of civilization.}
{370}{}{看看你的部落。他们为一些小麻烦争执不休。可怜的一口水，他们就准备割断对方的喉咙。凤凰城被周围所有的定居点所羡慕，而定居点本身更是相互憎恨。这些土地需要一种力量来团结他们，并引导他们走向文明复兴。}
### {371}{}{[Next]}
{371}{}{[下一个]}
### {372}{}{Is there such a force in these parts? No. But here we come. Of course, we have our own personal interests - pre-war resources and knowledge. You savages, in any case, are not able to properly use these deposits of priceless human creations.}
{372}{}{这些地方有这样的力量吗？没有，但我们来了。当然，我们有自己的个人利益――战前的资源和知识。在任何情况下，你们这些野蛮人都无法正确使用这些无价的人类创造物的沉积物。}
### {373}{}{[Next]}
{373}{}{[下一个]}
### {374}{}{To get them, we push the tribes on the path of progress and unification. Thus, they gain valuable experience. We brought to these lands the economy, currency, medicine, the first school in the entire post-war history! No matter how much the local savages hate us, the whole of Arizona owes us its new achievements.}
{374}{}{为了得到他们，我们推动部落走上进步和统一的道路。因此，他们获得了宝贵的经验。我们把经济、货币、医学带到了这些土地上，这是整个战后历史上的第一所学校！无论当地的野蛮人多么憎恨我们，整个亚利桑那州都欠我们新的成就。}
### {375}{}{Those are your words, Dixon. Does the General Staff know?}
{375}{}{这是你的话，Dixon。总参谋部知道吗？}
### {376}{}{This fort is worth several... aside from the decisions of the general Staff. I was given "broad powers" to successfully complete the main mission.}
{376}{}{这座堡垒值几个...除了总参谋部的决定。我被赋予了成功完成主要任务的“广泛权力”。}
### {377}{}{I see. May I ask another question about the Brotherhood?}
{377}{}{我明白了。我可以再问一个关于兄弟会的问题吗？}
### {380}{}{What are your global goals?}
{380}{}{你的全球目标是什么？}
### {381}{}{The answer will be ambiguous. There have been disputes between scribes for decades. Some believe that we should throw our efforts at restoring civilization according to the ideals of the Old World. Others consider the world not worthy of our knowledge and technology.}
{381}{}{答案将是模棱两可的。几十年来，抄写员之间一直存在争议。有些人认为，我们应该根据旧世界的理想，努力恢复文明。其他人则认为这个世界不配拥有我们的知识和技术。}
### {382}{}{[Next]}
{382}{}{[下一个]}
### {383}{}{In any case, the leadership was not going to influence Arizona. Here the order hoped only to replenish stocks of nuclear material and launch several surviving workshops. Exclusively for their own internal purposes and for the war with the super mutants. But it turned out to be much more complicated.}
{383}{}{无论如何，领导层不会影响亚利桑那州。在这里，该命令只希望补充核材料库存，并启动几个幸存的车间。只为他们自己的内部目的和与超级变种人的战争。但事实证明要复杂得多。}
### {384}{}{What do you mean?}
{384}{}{你是什么意思？}
### {385}{}{They don't understand that you can't just come and take old batteries from a pile of garbage. We need workers, caravans, even a postal service. We need a functioning infrastructure and economy! None of this happened until my squad entered these wild lands.}
{385}{}{他们不明白你不能只是来从一堆垃圾中拿走旧电池。我们需要工人，大篷车，甚至邮政服务。我们需要一个运转良好的基础设施和经济！直到我的小队进入这些荒原，这一切才发生。}
### {386}{}{I see. Let me ask you another question about the Brotherhood?}
{386}{}{我明白了。让我再问你一个关于兄弟会的问题？}
### {387}{}{Tell us about California.}
{387}{}{告诉我们加利福尼亚州的情况。}
### {388}{}{The lands of California are devastated by war and time. Los Angeles is in ruins. But gradually civilization rises from the ashes.}
{388}{}{加利福尼亚的土地被战争和时间摧毁了。洛杉矶一片废墟。但文明逐渐从灰烬中崛起。}

### {400}{}{I need to talk to you about the Rangers.}
{400}{}{我需要和你谈谈流浪者队的事。}
### {401}{}{These upstarts are always getting in the way and won't let us work. Did you manage to find out the weaknesses of their defense?}
{401}{}{这些暴发户总是挡道，不让我们工作。你发现他们防守的弱点了吗？}
### {402}{}{No, sir. They are too well organized.}
{402}{}{不，先生。他们组织得太好了。}
### {403}{}{It is difficult to expect something from a simple peasant. But I am sure that you will succeed. Keep me posted.}
{403}{}{对一个简单的农民期望是很难的。但我相信你会成功的。随时通知我。}
### {1403}{}{It's hard to expect anything from a simple peasant woman. But I am sure that you will succeed. Keep me posted.}
{1403}{}{很难对一个简单的农妇抱有任何期望。但我相信你会成功的。随时通知我。}
### {404}{}{Let me go.}
{404}{}{让我走。}
### {405}{}{Why are the Rangers bothering you? Don't they represent the law, just like you?}
{405}{}{为什么游骑兵队打扰你？他们不是和你一样代表法律吗？}
### {406}{}{Firstly, they consider us invaders and turn the population against us. And this directly interferes with our plans. Secondly, they restrain the development of progress, for example, sabotage the work of caravans and work camps. Finally, they have crushed huge lands under themselves and take a tax from the population. Who do they think they are?!}
{406}{}{首先，他们认为我们是侵略者，让人民反对我们。这直接干扰了我们的计划。第二，他们阻碍进步的发展，例如破坏大篷车和工作营地的工作。最后，他们把大片土地压在自己的脚下，并从人民那里征税。他们以为自己是谁？！}
### {407}{}{Perhaps they have a reason for that?}
{407}{}{也许他们有这样的理由？}
### {408}{}{Reminds me of someone, don't you think?}
{408}{}{让我想起某人，你不觉得吗？}
### {409}{}{Ahem... In the end, they don't let us connect California and Arizona. Moreover, they have already shown their meanness in the Battle of Nogales, when they tried to quarrel with the tinsmiths and oust us from the territory of the state. This is more than enough.}
{409}{}{啊...最后，他们不让我们把加州和亚利桑那州联系起来。此外，他们在诺加莱斯战役中已经表现出了他们的卑鄙，当时他们试图与锡匠争吵，并将我们逐出国家领土。这已经足够了。}
### {410}{}{Permission to go, General?}
{410}{}{允许去吗，将军？}
### {411}{}{I managed to blow up the Rangers' dam.}
{411}{}{我设法炸毁了游骑兵队的水坝。}
### {412}{}{I've already been informed. Good job. With your help, we will drive these invaders out of Arizona and restore order to the lands, as in the good old days.}
{412}{}{我已经接到通知了。干得好在你们的帮助下，我们将把这些入侵者赶出亚利桑那州，恢复土地秩序，就像过去一样。}
### {413}{}{And our agreement?}
{413}{}{我们的协议呢？}
### {414}{}{Of course, the Villa is now under our protection. We will send an ambassador to the village to conclude an alliance.}
{414}{}{当然，别墅现在在我们的保护之下。我们将派一位大使到村子里缔结一个联盟。}
### {415}{}{Good news.}
{415}{}{好消息。}
### {416}{}{In addition, for your services to the United States, I invite you to become a member of the Brotherhood of Steel. Previously, none of the civilians had such an honor. But I have special powers and I see great potential in you. Think about it and let me know your decision. You can go.}
{416}{}{此外，为了你们对美国的服务，我邀请你们成为钢铁兄弟会的一员。以前，没有一个平民有这样的荣誉。但我有特殊的能力，我看到了你巨大的潜力。好好想想，让我知道你的决定。你可以走了。}
### {417}{}{Thank you, General Dixon.}
{417}{}{谢谢你，迪克森将军。}

### {420}{}{I want to join the Brotherhood.}

### {421}{}{Kneel down and tell me your name.}

{425}{}{我想成为一名抄写员，继承旧世界的智慧。}
### {426}{}{I want to become a paladin and bring death to the enemies of the Brotherhood.}

### {427}{}{I want to become a knight to carry the light of technology.}

### {428}{}{I want to become a scout, in this I will be of the greatest benefit to the Brotherhood.}
{428}{}{我想成为一名侦察兵，在这方面我将对兄弟会大有裨益。}
### {429}{}{So be it. }
{429}{}{就这样吧。}
### {430}{}{ from the Villa. From now on, you are an honorary member of the Order of the Brotherhood of Steel. Do not disgrace our name and honor the laws. Remain faithful until death.}
{430}{}{别墅。从现在起，你是钢铁兄弟会的荣誉成员。不要玷污我们的名誉，遵守法律。至死不渝。}
### {431}{}{I swear loyalty!}
{431}{}{我发誓忠诚！}
### {432}{}{Although I promised to give you a rank in the order, but it turned out that there is an evil reputation about you among our brothers. I'll have to hold off on the order until you prove yourself again.}
{432}{}{虽然我答应给你一个等级，但事实证明，在我们的兄弟中，你有一个邪恶的名声。我将不得不推迟订单，直到你再次证明自己。}
### {433}{}{Damn. Reputation is quite a thing...}
{433}{}{该死声誉是一件很重要的事情...}
### {434}{}{Our order can be entered only for outstanding merits. And your exploits aren't that impressive.}
{434}{}{我们的订单只有在有突出优点的情况下才能输入。你的功绩并没有那么令人印象深刻。}
### {435}{}{I will try my best.}
{435}{}{我会尽力的。}
### {436}{}{Okay. You'll hear more about it, General.}
{436}{}{可以你会听到更多关于它的消息，将军。}
### {437}{}{Your services to the Brotherhood are invaluable. I am ready to accept you into our order.}
