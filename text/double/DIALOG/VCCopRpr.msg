{100}{}{你看柯蒂斯。 -- You see Curtis.}
#{101}{}{You see a mechanic with a wrench in his hand. He has quite a puzzled look.}
{101}{}{你看到一个机械师手里拿着扳手。他一脸困惑。 -- You see a mechanic with a wrench in his hand. He has quite a puzzled look.}
#{110}{}{What do you want, pal?}
{110}{}{你想要什么，伙计？ -- What do you want, pal?}
#{111}{}{I'm just stopping by, to see how fellow hard worker is doing.}
{111}{}{我只是顺道过来看看同事们干得怎么样。 -- I'm just stopping by, to see how fellow hard worker is doing.}
#{112}{}{Nothing.}
{112}{}{没有什么。 -- Nothing.}
#{113}{}{"Fellow hard worker"? Heh! Bad, as always. Do you see this big guy on the floor?}
{113}{}{“努力的同事”？嘿！坏的，一如既往。你看见地板上有个大个子吗？ -- "Fellow hard worker"? Heh! Bad, as always. Do you see this big guy on the floor?}
#{114}{}{Robo-cop? Funny...}
{114}{}{机器人警察？好笑。。。 -- Robo-cop? Funny...}
#{115}{}{Yeah, it is. So many complicated stuff to fix just so he could stand somewhere for intimidation. I'd have better luck wearing this junk on me and scaring the passersby myself.}
{115}{}{是的，是的。这么多复杂的事情要处理，只是为了让他站在某个地方受到恐吓。我穿上这件破烂衣服，自己吓唬路人，运气会好一些。 -- Yeah, it is. So many complicated stuff to fix just so he could stand somewhere for intimidation. I'd have better luck wearing this junk on me and scaring the passersby myself.}
#{116}{}{Do you think there would be no benefit from it?}
{116}{}{你认为这样做没有好处吗？ -- Do you think there would be no benefit from it?}
#{117}{}{Well, with full ammunition and in normal condition, he is, of course, a real death machine. Perhaps, the chief could use it in special operations. But in general, this piece of hardware is designed to intimidate with its look.}
{117}{}{好吧，在正常情况下，弹药充足，他当然是一个真正的死亡机器。也许，酋长可以在特别行动中使用它。但总的来说，这件硬件的设计是为了用它的外观来吓唬人。 -- Well, with full ammunition and in normal condition, he is, of course, a real death machine. Perhaps, the chief could use it in special operations. But in general, this piece of hardware is designed to intimidate with its look.}

{118}{}{你认为激活后他会很危险吗？ -- Do you think he would be dangerous, after the activation?}
#{119}{}{Who knows... The military model was not created for peaceful purposes, baby. They were made to KILL! And this robot is lied dormant for, like, 70 years, with no check-ups. Luckily, I came up with taking away his ammunition and disabling lower servomotors, to avoid being killed on the spot when he'll be turned on. But it's the other thing that scares me - not many people can understand this level of robotic tech. So, no one could really tell what's on the mind of this piece of iron. We have to rely on testing and spend a lot of time to study the blueprints. So much effort for one robot! Is it worth it? I'm not sure.}
{119}{}{谁知道。。。军事模型不是为了和平目的而建立的，宝贝。他们是被杀的！这个机器人休眠了，大概70年，没有检查。幸运的是，我想出了拿走他的弹药和禁用较低的伺服电机，以避免被当场杀死时，他将被打开。但另一件事让我害怕的是，没有多少人能理解这种机器人技术的水平，所以，没有人能真正说出这块铁的想法。我们必须依靠测试，并花费大量时间研究蓝图。为一个机器人付出了这么多的努力！值得吗？我不确定。 -- Who knows...

#{120}{}{Does he has any imperfections?}
{120}{}{他有什么缺点吗？ -- Does he has any imperfections?}
#{121}{}{Of course he has! It's full of electronics. One shot of pulse round - and the circuits will simply fry. It's a common problem for all pre-war build robots.}
{121}{}{他当然有！里面全是电子产品。一次脉冲循环-电路就会完全崩溃。这是所有战前建造的机器人的共同问题。 -- Of course he has! It's full of electronics. One shot of pulse round - and the circuits will simply fry. It's a common problem for all pre-war build robots.}
