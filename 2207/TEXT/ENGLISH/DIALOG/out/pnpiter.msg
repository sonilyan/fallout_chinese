### {55}{}{Firstly, the last working toilet is clogged, so there's nothing to do anyway. Secondly, seems that the last new guy, who went to plunge the toilet, lost his consciousness in the process, and now rats are feasting on him. And the rats here are VERY dangerous and hungry. So the bottom line is - the toilet is out of order.}
{55}{}{首先，最后一个工作厕所堵塞了，所以没有什么可做的。第二，似乎最后一个新来的家伙，去了厕所，在这个过程中失去了意识，现在老鼠正在大快朵颐。这里的老鼠非常危险而且饥饿。所以底线是――厕所坏了。}

{20}{}{…新的。这是可以理解的。这里的每个人都是。除了一些人昨天来的，而另一些人――很多年前来的。这就是区别。我是彼得。我在帮波诺管理这里的事务。必须有人确保墙壁能支撑住屋顶，而且有人就是我。我在做。}

### {110}{}{What can I say? You gotta do what you gotta do. See, I was just another Technology Servant in Tartarus, I even remember Smitty teaching me... How long has it been, six years? Should be. Then I ran away. Just couldn't take this Herald anymore, barely held the urge to kill him off. I walked around for a couple of days around the tower - and ended up here. Don't see the reason to whine - it's obvious that Tartarus is a better place to live, so I'm helping Bono to make deal with the guards. To let some of us enter.}
{110}{}{我能说什么？你必须做你该做的。看，我只是塔尔塔罗斯的另一个技术仆人，我甚至记得史密蒂教我……六年了，有多久了？应该是的。然后我逃跑了。我再也受不了这份《先驱报》了，几乎没有杀死他的冲动。我在塔周围走了几天，最后来到了这里。不要看有什么理由抱怨――很明显，塔尔塔罗斯是一个更好的地方，所以我正在帮助波诺处理警卫的问题。让我们中的一些人进入。}
### {111}{012}{Let some of you into Tartarus? Sounds questionable. They take all outsiders for terrible creatures.}
{111}{012}{让你们中的一些人进入鞑靼？听起来有问题。他们把所有外来者都当成可怕的生物。}

### {120}{}{Oh, come on! Look around, the half of people here are from Tartarus! Of course, they won't let in ghouls and Seekers, but me and Bono are sure that it's possible to work out a deal. Maybe offer guards batteries or drugs, I don't know. Bono had some ideas.}
{120}{}{哦，来吧！环顾四周，这里有一半的人来自塔尔塔罗斯！当然，他们不会让食尸鬼和探索者进来，但我和波诺确信达成协议是可能的。也许给警卫提供电池或毒品，我不知道。波诺有一些想法。}

### {200}{}{We are surviving here, that's what happens. People run away from Tartarus, from Radius - and end up here. It is obvious you won't last long in wastelands alone - but here everyone is in the same situation. So they pack together. Me and Bono are trying to make a deal with guards to let some of us enter Tartarus. Robin and his Seekers are looking for food, Hugo is making plans about taking over Tartarus by force. Stay away from him, he's crazy.}
{200}{}{我们在这里生存，这就是事实。人们逃离塔尔塔罗斯，逃离Radius，最终来到这里。很明显，你一个人在荒原上活不了多久，但这里的每个人都处于同样的境地。所以他们一起打包。我和波诺正试图与警卫达成协议，让我们中的一些人进入塔尔塔罗斯。罗宾和他的探索者正在寻找食物，雨果正在制定武力接管塔尔塔罗斯的计划。离他远点，他疯了。}

### {310}{}{Okay then, I would be very grateful to you, just as all other inhabitants of the station. So, you see, there are two problems here: to kill the rats and to plunge the toilet.

{310}{}{好吧，我会非常感谢你，就像车站的所有其他居民一样。所以，你看，这里有两个问题：杀死老鼠和跳进厕所。你可以用任何你想用的方式对付老鼠，但你需要马桶的柱塞，无法绕过。我为什么要告诉你这些？你在塔尔塔罗斯受够了，对吧？}
