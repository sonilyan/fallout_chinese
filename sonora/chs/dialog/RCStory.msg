{201}{}{来自北方的一个村庄。我们称之为别墅。}
### {202}{}{Well, I've been patrolling in other directions. But I heard something about the Villa. Is it about you who was told that you grow crops in the middle of a barren desert? Surprisingly. I thought it was the usual bullshit you hear in the dining room.}
{202}{}{嗯，我一直在其他方向巡逻。但我听说了一些关于别墅的事。是关于你被告知在贫瘠的沙漠中种植作物吗？惊人地我以为这是你在餐厅里经常听到的废话。}

#Questions
### {220}{}{Why do you live right on the dam?}
{220}{}{你为什么就住在大坝上？}
### {221}{}{Why? This is an excellent fortification against enemies and bad weather. No one will even think of storming here or trying to spy.}
{221}{}{为什么？这是抵御敌人和恶劣天气的绝佳防御工事。甚至没有人会想到冲进这里或试图侦察。}
### {222}{}{Is this an unsafe place?}
{222}{}{这是一个不安全的地方吗？}
### {223}{}{This dam will stand here for another couple of centuries. At least that's what Old Rufus says. And what can happen here? It's just a piece of concrete in the middle of the mountains.}
{223}{}{这座大坝将在这里再矗立几个世纪。至少老鲁弗斯是这么说的。这里会发生什么？它只是在山中央的一块混凝土。}
### {224}{}{Who is this Old Man Rufus?}
{224}{}{鲁弗斯老人是谁？}
### {225}{}{The caretaker of the Dam. He has been in this position for more than a dozen years. Although many believe that he gets his ration for nothing. He seems to be at the power plant right now.}
{225}{}{大坝管理员。他担任这个职位已经有十几年了。尽管许多人认为他免费获得口粮。他现在好像在发电厂。}
### {226}{}{So this is where all the Arizona Rangers live?}
{226}{}{亚利桑那游骑兵队都住在这里？}
### {227}{}{Of course not. It's just a barracks for temporary accommodation. You can get a bed here only for a certain period or for some reason. And the rest of the time, look for a place in the sun, as a normal ranger should.}
{227}{}{当然不是。这只是一个临时住所的营房。你只能在一段时间内或出于某种原因在这里找到一张床。剩下的时间，像一个普通的护林员一样，在阳光下寻找一个地方。}

### {230}{}{I'm just wondering how to become a cadet?}
{230}{}{我只是想知道如何成为一名学员？}
### {231}{}{Well, there are different ways. Usually we need a recommendation from someone with whom we have good relations - traders, leaders of friendly settlements, other rangers. And if there are no recommendations, then you need to show yourself in action.}
{231}{}{嗯，有不同的方法。通常，我们需要与我们关系良好的人的推荐――贸易商、友好定居点的领导人、其他护林员。如果没有建议，那么你需要表现出自己的行动。}
### {232}{}{How long does the training last?}
{232}{}{训练持续多久？}
### {233}{}{At least five years, but it all depends on the cadet. The decision to raise must be earned by real merits in the field.}
{233}{}{至少五年，但这完全取决于学员。提高工资的决定必须通过实地的实际业绩来获得。}
### {234}{}{Are you a cadet too?}
{234}{}{你也是一名学员吗？}
### {235}{}{I? Nope. But I have to help the greenery grow up. It's our way - you can't be useful in the field, help at the base.}
{235}{}{我没有。但我必须帮助绿色植物长大。这是我们的方式――你在战场上不可能有用，在基地帮忙。}
### {236}{}{What prevents you from participating in operations?}
{236}{}{是什么阻止您参与运营？}
### {237}{}{And you, it turns out, are not capable of more, right?}
{237}{}{事实证明，你没有能力做得更多，对吧？}
### {238}{}{ (raises the bandaged leg) Damn wolves. They attacked me while on patrol on the Colorado River. I lost my vigilance - and here is my reckoning.}
{238}{}{（抬起裹着绷带的腿）该死的狼。他们在科罗拉多河巡逻时袭击了我。我失去了警惕――这是我的清算。}
### {239}{}{Maybe I can cure her?}
{239}{}{也许我能治好她？}
### {240}{}{If you pay, I'll cure her.}
{240}{}{如果你付钱，我会治好她的。}
### {241}{}{Oh, that's definitely a problem. Can we talk about something more positive?}
{241}{}{哦，那肯定是个问题。我们能谈谈更积极的事情吗？}
### {242}{}{Seriously? I would be grateful. But do you really know what to do?}
{242}{}{认真地我将不胜感激。但你真的知道该怎么办吗？}

{243}{}{让我看看...}
### {244}{}{Use medical skills or medications to treat the injury.}

### {250}{}{Probably, such an experienced ranger knows a lot of interesting stories.}
{250}{}{也许，这样一个经验丰富的护林员知道很多有趣的故事。}
### {251}{}{I never miss an opportunity to ask travelers about what I saw. However, usually many of them lie in their stories.}
{251}{}{我从不错过向旅行者询问我所看到的一切的机会。然而，他们中的许多人通常都在自己的故事中撒谎。}

### {270}{}{You mentioned wolves. What other creatures are found along the Colorado?}
{270}{}{你提到了狼。科罗拉多河沿岸还发现了哪些生物？}

### {272}{}{For example?}
{272}{}{例如}
### {273}{}{Oh, yeah, I see.}
{273}{}{哦，是的，我明白了。}
### {274}{}{Horned lizards the size of a dog can be found in the thickets. At first glance, not such a strong opponent, but her spikes all over her body do not allow her to get close for a close-range attack. Besides, it's a damn smart thing with an excellent disguise.}
{274}{}{在灌木丛中可以找到狗大小的有角蜥蜴。乍一看，她不是一个如此强大的对手，但她全身的尖刺让她无法近距离进攻。此外，这是一个非常聪明的伪装。}
### {275}{}{How interesting! Tell me more?}
{275}{}{真有趣！告诉我更多？}
### {276}{}{There's a lot of such game, nothing special.}
{276}{}{有很多这样的游戏，没有什么特别的。}
### {277}{}{Do you want a scarier one? The caves are inhabited by bulldog bats - real demons. They are waiting for the victim at the entrance and quickly fly out at her, not letting her come to her senses. One such creature can lift a man into the air and drag him back into the cave. He can't go back.}
{277}{}{你想要更恐怖的吗？洞穴里住着斗牛犬蝙蝠――真正的恶魔。他们在入口处等着受害者，并迅速向她飞去，不让她清醒过来。一个这样的生物可以把一个人抬到空中，然后把他拖回洞穴。他回不去了。}
### {278}{}{Seriously? My hamstrings are already shaking.}
{278}{}{认真地我的腿筋已经在发抖了。}
### {279}{}{Somehow it's hard to believe. And these are all local inhabitants?}
{279}{}{不知怎么的，很难相信。这些都是当地居民吗？}
### {280}{}{Between the Colorado rocks, there are scolopendras up to two yards long. From their bite, death occurs within one second. Their carapace cannot be pierced even with a knife, and their jaws are so strong that they can cut a person in half.}
{280}{}{在科罗拉多的岩石之间，有长达两码长的Scolopendra。它们被咬后，一秒钟内就会死亡。它们的甲壳即使用刀也无法刺穿，而且它们的下巴非常强壮，可以把人切成两半。}
### {281}{}{Oh, Mom! Don't tell me there's something scarier!}
{281}{}{哦，妈妈！别告诉我还有更可怕的事！}
### {282}{}{Someone has a poor fantasy on history. Don't you find it?}
{282}{}{有人对历史幻想很差。你没找到吗？}
### {283}{}{There are also rumors about pitiful hypnotic butterflies and armadillos that use old cars as a shell. But I myself have only met wolves, lizards and rodents of all stripes.}
{283}{}{也有传言说可怜的催眠蝴蝶和以旧车为壳的armadillos。但我自己只见过各种各样的狼、蜥蜴和啮齿动物。}

### {288}{}{Your chatter makes my head hurt. Are you trying to intimidate all strangers?}
{288}{}{你的喋喋不休让我头疼。你想恐吓所有的陌生人吗？}
### {289}{}{Well... I've heard it all from other people. Don't quibble. But don't doubt that there are plenty of hostile creatures around. Stay vigilant.}
{289}{}{好我都是从别人那里听说的。不要狡辩。但不要怀疑周围有很多充满敌意的生物。保持警惕。}
### {290}{}{Tell me about the creatures of the Colorado River.}
{290}{}{告诉我科罗拉多河的生物。}

#Promotion party
### {310}{}{Hey, it's a new *star* in person!}
{310}{}{嘿，这是一个新的明星！}
### {311}{}{Yes, it wasn't easy to get a badge. But how do you know?}
{311}{}{是的，获得徽章并不容易。但是你怎么知道呢？}
### {312}{}{Rumors spread quickly at the base. But you know what? You don't have to wait for a gift from me. The others have been earning a star for years, and you just come and take it!}
{312}{}{谣言在基地迅速传开。但你知道吗？你不必等待我的礼物。其他人多年来一直在赚一颗星，你就来拿吧！}
### {313}{}{It looks like you don't like me from the first meeting. But I don't care.}
{313}{}{从第一次见面开始你就好像不喜欢我。但我不在乎。}

{318}{}{享受你今天是个英雄。}
### {1318}{}{Enjoy. You're a star today.}
{1318}{}{享受你今天是个明星。}

### {320}{}{Are you kidding me?}
{320}{}{你在开玩笑吗？}
### {321}{}{How did you guess? Maybe it's because they don't throw fireworks in your honor? The rest of us have been earning a star for years, and you just come and take it! So don't expect a gift from me.}
{321}{}{你怎么猜到的？也许是因为他们不向你扔烟花？我们其他人多年来一直在赚一颗星，而你只是来拿它！所以别指望我会给你礼物。}
### {322}{}{Rumors spread quickly at the base. I'm happy for you. Few manage to get a badge at the very beginning of the service. Or rather, no one succeeds. Let me supply you with personal supplies in honor of such a holiday. Well done!}
{322}{}{谣言在基地迅速传开。我为你感到高兴。很少有人能在服役一开始就获得徽章。或者更确切地说，没有人成功。为了纪念这样一个节日，让我为你提供个人用品。干得好！}
### {323}{}{Thank you, a party at the top of the dam is what I've always wanted.}
{323}{}{谢谢你，我一直想要在大坝顶端举办一个派对。}

### {333}{}{Another time.}

### {337}{}{Yes, but this one will outshine everyone with its size!}

### {338}{}{Why don't the Rangers hunt him down and attack him all at once?}
{338}{}{为什么游骑兵队不立刻追捕并攻击他呢？}
### {339}{}{This creature is hiding in a barren desert, where even an experienced ranger is hard to hold out for a few days. She crawls out of the desert while hunting and then goes back. To meet such a monster, you will have to become its victim in some sense.}
{339}{}{这种生物躲在贫瘠的沙漠中，即使是一个经验丰富的护林员也很难坚持几天。她一边打猎一边爬出沙漠，然后又回去了。要遇到这样一个怪物，你必须在某种意义上成为它的受害者。}
### {340}{}{But why do you think all this is true and not fiction?}
{340}{}{但你为什么认为这一切都是真的而不是虚构的呢？}
### {341}{}{Because I saw everything with my own eyes. And I'm not the only one. One day we were lucky enough to track down this game in the desert between Quartz and San Brahmin. There was a serious massacre, we barely got out of there, and since then we decided that it was better to avoid this scorpion.}
{341}{}{因为我亲眼看到了一切。我不是唯一一个。有一天，我们很幸运地在Quartz和San Brahmin之间的沙漠中找到了这场比赛。发生了一场严重的大屠杀，我们几乎没有离开那里，从那以后，我们决定最好避开这只蝎子。}
### {342}{}{Clearly, I will try to hunt down and kill this creature.}
{342}{}{很明显，我会努力追捕并杀死这个生物。}
### {343}{}{Seriously? Commendable zeal. But if you become a monster's lunch, then blame yourself.}
{343}{}{认真地值得称赞的热情。但如果你变成了怪物的午餐，那就责怪自己吧。}
### {344}{}{Happily. I'll bring you some souvenir.}
{344}{}{高兴地我给你带些纪念品。}

### {354}{}{COME ON?! And of course you have no proof, right?}
{354}{}{来吧？！当然你没有证据，对吧？}
### {355}{}{A corpse is easy to find in the middle of the desert. Give the task to the patrolmen, they will confirm.}
{355}{}{在沙漠中央很容易找到一具尸体。把任务交给巡警，他们会确认的。}
### {356}{}{Hmm, this can be arranged. If this is true, then thanks from all the Rangers. You've done a great service to the whole Wasteland.}
{356}{}{嗯，这个可以安排。如果这是真的，那么感谢所有的流浪者。你为整个荒原做出了巨大的贡献。}
### {1356}{}{Hmm, that can be arranged. If this is true, then thanks from all the Rangers. You have done a great service to the whole Wasteland.}
{1356}{}{嗯，可以安排。如果这是真的，那么感谢所有的流浪者。你为整个荒原做出了巨大的贡献。}
### {357}{}{It seemed to me that such services should be paid for.}
{357}{}{在我看来，这样的服务应该付费。}
### {358}{}{And it seemed to me that such statements should be supported by evidence. Is not it so?}
{358}{}{在我看来，这种说法应该有证据支持。不是吗？}
### {359}{}{Ugh, it's too late to look for evidence. So just mentioning me in the chronicles is enough.}
{359}{}{啊，现在找证据已经太晚了。所以只要在编年史中提到我就足够了。}
### {360}{}{That's enough for me. Happily.}
{360}{}{这对我来说已经足够了。很高兴。}
### {361}{}{I can only show this stump of a spear that was sticking out of the shell.}

{362}{}{该死的！我记得他...你真的打败了这个怪物吗？但是怎样}
### {363}{}{He is big, but clumsy.}
{363}{}{他个子很大，但很笨拙。}
### {364}{}{There is no price for people like you. Here, take some cartridges from me and this old revolver as a token of appreciation. Don't be modest, I have something to shoot back from mutants in the desert. Thank you again.}
{364}{}{像你这样的人没有价格。给，从我这里拿走一些子弹和这把旧左轮手枪，以示感谢。不要谦虚，我有一些东西可以从沙漠中的变种人身上回击。再次感谢。}
