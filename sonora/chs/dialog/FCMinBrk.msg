#Dialog
### {200}{}{(without looking up from his work) And? What do you need?}
{200}{}{（没有抬头看他的作品）然后呢？你需要什么？}
### {201}{}{Nothing.}
{201}{}{没有什么}
### {202}{}{(continuing his work) Let's go faster.}
{202}{}{（继续他的工作）让我们走得更快。}
### {203}{}{Bye.}
{203}{}{再见}
### {204}{}{Wait, tell me something else.}
{204}{}{等等，告诉我别的事。}

### {210}{}{Tell us about your work.}
{210}{}{告诉我们你的工作。}
### {211}{}{What's there to tell? I take the ore, load it into the machine, and it grinds and cleans it. The purified ore is sent to the enrichment machine, the rest is thrown out. That's it.}
{211}{}{有什么好说的？我把矿石装进机器，机器研磨并清洗。净化后的矿石被送到浓缩机，剩下的被扔掉。就是这样。}
### {212}{}{Why clean the ore?}
{212}{}{为什么要清理矿石？}
### {213}{}{Because uranium must be free of impurities, otherwise it will not give the necessary energy. However, I don't fully understand the whole technology myself.}
{213}{}{因为铀必须不含杂质，否则就不能提供必要的能量。然而，我自己并不完全了解整个技术。}
### {214}{}{Is it safe to work with uranium?}
{214}{}{用铀工作安全吗？}
### {215}{}{If you're talking about radiation, then it's not terrible until the ore is cleaned. But it is quite possible to get injured from this damned ancient machine.}
{215}{}{如果你说的是辐射，那么在矿石被清理之前并不可怕。但是很有可能被这台该死的古老机器弄伤。}

### {220}{}{Where does this equipment come from?}
{220}{}{这些设备是从哪里来的？}
### {221}{}{Left over from the old days. Although these are small things compared to what was here before.}
{221}{}{过去遗留下来的。尽管与以前相比，这些都是小事。}
### {222}{}{That is, before the war, uranium was also mined and purified here?}
{222}{}{也就是说，在战争之前，铀也在这里开采和提纯？}
### {223}{}{Yeah. The underground galleries are well preserved, but some of the equipment and buildings have fallen into disrepair.}
{223}{}{是 啊地下画廊保存完好，但一些设备和建筑年久失修。}
### {224}{}{Something is missing here, don't you find?}
{224}{}{这里少了点什么，你没发现吗？}
### {225}{}{Eh? What are you talking about?}
{225}{}{呃？你在说什么？}
### {226}{}{Just simple doubts.}
{226}{}{只是简单的怀疑。}
### {227}{}{It can't be that people just came and started these ancient machines. Where did so much lost knowledge come from?}
{227}{}{这不可能是人们刚刚来到并启动了这些古老的机器。这么多丢失的知识是从哪里来的？}
### {228}{}{That's right. They say that before the creation of the colony, Faber hired some types who repaired and prepared the equipment. And only after that he brought people here and started production. But none of the locals could have done it.}
{228}{}{没错。他们说，在殖民地建立之前，费伯雇佣了一些修理和准备设备的人。在那之后，他把人们带到这里并开始生产。但没有一个当地人能做到。}
### {229}{}{How interesting. Tell me something else.}
{229}{}{真有趣。告诉我其他的事情。}

### {230}{}{Are you here of your own free will?}
{230}{}{你是自愿来的吗？}
### {231}{}{Formally. I have nowhere to go, so I'm kind of a willing slave.}
{231}{}{正式地我无处可去，所以我是一个心甘情愿的奴隶。}
### {232}{}{What do you think about slavery?}
{232}{}{你怎么看待奴隶制？}
### {233}{}{I don't know. It's probably not good to force others to work for you. But here's what I think - we're all in the same cage here.}
{233}{}{我不知道。强迫别人为你工作可能是不好的。但我的想法是――我们都在同一个笼子里。}

### {240}{}{The mines are blown up. What are you going to do now?}
{240}{}{地雷被炸毁了。你现在打算做什么？}
### {241}{}{I don't know. I will do what I am ordered to do. I have nowhere to go anyway.}
{241}{}{我不知道。我会按照命令去做的，反正我无处可去。}
### {242}{}{The whip won't bother anyone anymore. Look outside.}
{242}{}{鞭子不会再打扰任何人了。向外看。}

### {250}{}{Does the supervisor often beat up the workers?}
{250}{}{主管经常殴打工人吗？}
### {251}{}{(sigh) This Whip... he's a real psycho, snaps at everyone. I get it from him too, but not so often. I wish I could get rid of him, but Faber appoints the guards himself.}
{251}{}{（叹气）这个鞭子。。。他真是个神经病，对每个人都大发雷霆。我也从他那里得到，但不经常。我希望我能把他赶走，但法伯亲自任命了警卫。}
### {252}{}{What about the administrator? Can't he do anything?}
{252}{}{管理员呢？他什么都做不了吗？}
### {253}{}{I don't know why I'm telling you this. But the Whip forces him to rewrite reports, as if the imprisoned workers were hit by a landslide or injured themselves. He doesn't want to tarnish his reputation, the bastard. But he also keeps the administrator in check.}
{253}{}{我不知道我为什么要告诉你这些。但辉格党人强迫他重写报告，就好像被监禁的工人被山体滑坡击中或受伤一样。他不想玷污自己的名誉，混蛋。但他也控制着管理员。}
### {254}{}{But what's the point of crippled slaves?}
{254}{}{但是残疾奴隶有什么意义呢？}
### {255}{}{I'm telling you, Knut is just an evil person. I think Faber specifically chose such a tough warden to strengthen control over the prisoners, because there have been a lot of problems with them lately. Besides, Roy and Knut are on good terms. But Faber hardly knows the whole truth.}
{255}{}{我告诉你，克努特只是一个邪恶的人。我认为费伯特别选择了这样一位强硬的监狱长来加强对囚犯的控制，因为他们最近遇到了很多问题。此外，罗伊和克努特关系很好。但费伯几乎不知道全部真相。}
### {256}{}{I can kill him for you and the rest of the prisoners.}
{256}{}{我可以为你和其他囚犯杀了他。}
### {257}{}{What nonsense is this? Are you serious? Would you kill a man for a handful of prisoners? Even the mercenaries in the garrison aren't that bloodthirsty. Besides, it may not make sense if another tyrant takes the place of the Whip. In any case, don't try to involve me in this. I have nothing to do with it!}
{257}{}{这是什么胡说八道？你是认真的吗？你会为了几个囚犯而杀人吗？即使是驻军的雇佣兵也不那么嗜血。此外，如果另一个暴君取代辉格党人的位置，这可能是没有意义的。无论如何，不要试图让我卷入这件事。我与此事无关！}
### {258}{}{It is ok. I have no conscience because of any scum.}
{258}{}{没关系。我没有良心，因为有人渣。}
### {259}{}{Perhaps you're right. A delicate and legal way is needed here.}
{259}{}{也许你是对的。这里需要一种微妙而合法的方式。}
### {260}{}{I'll tell Faber what's really going on. It's sure to piss him off.}
{260}{}{我会告诉费伯到底发生了什么。这肯定会激怒他的。}
### {261}{}{I doubt he'll listen to you. But don't get me involved in this. I have nothing to do with it!}
{261}{}{我怀疑他会听你的。但不要让我卷入其中。我与此事无关！}
### {262}{}{Still, it's worth a try. Bye.}
{262}{}{尽管如此，还是值得一试。再见}
### {263}{}{Then I'll just finish this Whip. Wait for the corpse near the entrance.}
{263}{}{那我就把这个鞭子干掉。在入口处等尸体。}
### {264}{}{How do you like the new supervisor?}
{264}{}{你觉得新主管怎么样？}
### {265}{}{Better than before. He does not wring too much and keeps himself in hand. I'm glad you managed to fire Knut.}
{265}{}{比以前好。他不太着急，控制住自己。我很高兴你解雇了克努特。}
### {266}{}{It was easy. Be.}
{266}{}{这很容易。是}
### {267}{}{This Whip won't bother you or anyone else anymore.}
{267}{}{这个辉格党人不会再打扰你或其他人了。}
### {268}{}{You... killed him? You're crazy! In any case, this does not really solve the problem, because an even bigger tyrant can be put after the Whip. Haven't you thought about that? Okay, I didn't hear anything, and I had nothing to do with it.}
{268}{}{你杀了他？你疯了！无论如何，这并不能真正解决问题，因为在辉格党之后可以放一个更大的暴君。你没想过吗？好吧，我什么也没听到，我和它没有任何关系。}
### {1268}{}{You... killed him? You're crazy! In any case, this does not really solve the problem, because an even bigger tyrant can be put after the Whip. Haven't you thought about that? So, okay, I didn't hear anything, and I had nothing to do with it.}
{1268}{}{你杀了他？你疯了！无论如何，这并不能真正解决问题，因为在辉格党之后可以放一个更大的暴君。你没想过吗？所以，好吧，我什么都没听到，我也和它无关。}
### {269}{}{And this is all your gratitude? Not much.}
{269}{}{这就是你所有的感激之情？不多}
