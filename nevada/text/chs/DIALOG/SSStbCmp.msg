#{130}{}{This lab unsuccessfully tried to develop drugs like buffout, but it was too difficult with local working conditions. Test samples were issued, each of which was later recognized as a defective. However, samples were spread among dealers (possibly at a cost of customers' lives).}
{130}{}{这个实验室试图开发像buffout这样的药物，但没有成功，但在当地的工作条件下太困难了。发放了测试样品，每个样品后来都被认定为有缺陷。然而，样品在经销商之间传播（可能以牺牲客户生命为代价）。}
#{131}{}{This is one of the main products of the Pound. Here were created various kinds of psychedelics, including LSD, mescaline and psilocybin. The main focus was chemicals based on hallucinogenic mushrooms. Products were successful not only among locals, but also outside of Vegas. Looks like many people in this world want to escape reality...}
{131}{}{这是英镑的主要产品之一。这里创造了各种各样的迷幻药，包括迷幻药，美司卡林和psilocybin。主要的焦点是基于致幻蘑菇的化学物质。产品不仅在当地人中很成功，在维加斯以外的地方也很成功。看来这个世界上很多人都想逃避现实...}

{133}{}{药物池很小。它包括兴奋剂，一些止痛药，植物制成的治疗粉末和一些低价值的药物。所有批次的产品都是最近生产的，这意味着实验室以前从未使用过此类产品。}
#{134}{}{Some influential person from the Clean City has made an order through intermediaries to manufacture light drugs with a small addiction effect. Even though the names are not listed, it becomes clear that the Pound has its own people in Clean City.}
{134}{}{来自清洁城市的一些有影响力的人通过中介机构下了一个命令，制造出一种轻微上瘾的轻毒品。尽管没有列出这些人的名字，但很明显，英镑在清洁城市有自己的人。}
#{140}{}{The Pound held a series of experiments, both in recreating old drugs and medicines and creating completely new ones. It seems that smart people worked here.}
{140}{}{英镑举行了一系列的实验，既在再造旧的药物和药品，创造全新的。看来聪明人在这里工作。}

#{150}{}{This old drug of military origin has become a real panacea for management. For some time the lab was engaged exclusively in attempts of independent creation of psycho. Such product would bring big profits to the Pound. But local conditions, equipment and the lack of the necessary components have only led to shutting down the research.}
{150}{}{这种源于军事的老药已成为管理的真正灵丹妙药。一段时间以来，实验室一直致力于独立创造精神病的尝试。这种产品将给英镑带来巨大的利润。但当地的条件、设备和必要的组成部分的缺乏只导致了研究的停止。}
#{151}{}{Similar with "Psycho", the project was closed due to inability to manufacture it in local conditions.}
{151}{}{与“Psycho”类似，该项目因无法在当地条件下制造而关闭。}
#{152}{}{Unlike "Buffout" and "Psycho" experiments, "Mentats" could go into mass production... But the drug appeared to be unprofitable. Considering the large labor and resource costs, the Pound couldn't compete with pre-war reserves in the region. In addition, the current need for this product was clearly less than for a number of other drugs.}
{152}{}{与“Buffout”和“Psycho”实验不同，“Mentats”可以批量生产...但这种药似乎无利可图。考虑到巨大的劳动力和资源成本，英镑无法与该地区战前的储备相抗衡。此外，目前对该产品的需求明显少于其他一些药物。}
#{153}{}{Psychedelics long held a priority place in the production... Until they filled the market so much that the Pound itself ran into distribution problem. As a result, the management appointed a series of experiments on LSD and other psychedelic substances in order to make them more demanded. For example, "Bromine-LSD" project designed to create LSD without psychedelic effect, which could be useful for people with various brain disorders, for example, cluster pains. Too bad the Clean City decided that psychedelics have to uproot from the market completely.}
{153}{}{迷幻药长期以来在生产中占据着优先地位...直到他们在市场上挤满了人，英镑本身就陷入了分配问题。因此，管理层指定了一系列关于迷幻药和其他迷幻药的实验，以使他们的需求量更大。例如，“溴迷幻药”项目旨在制造无迷幻效果的迷幻药，这可能对患有各种脑部疾病的人有用，例如，丛集性疼痛。糟糕的是，清洁城市决定，迷幻药必须从市场上彻底根除。}
#{154}{}{The management of the Pound sought to legalize itself in the Clean City, in order to stop attacks from the police and remove the conspiracy factor. To do this, the Pound tried to take up the production of various "peaceful" medications, such as stimulants and painkillers.}
{154}{}{英镑的管理层试图使自己在这个干净的城市合法化，以阻止来自警察的袭击，消除阴谋因素。为此，英镑试图生产各种“和平”药物，如兴奋剂和止痛药。}
#{160}{}{The highest priority goals: 1. Complete "Bromine-LSD"; 2. Organize a stable delivery line to New Reno; 3. Reduce the death rate among the slaves by 15% and more; 4. Replicate the recipe of a fighting stimulant from Reno.}
