#{100}{}{You see Robert.}
{100}{}{你看到罗伯特了。}
#{101}{}{You see a resident of the Wind of War.}
{101}{}{你看到一个战争之风的居民。}
#{102}{}{::grabs his head:: My life is meaningless...}
{102}{}{●抓住他的头：：我的生命毫无意义...}
#{103}{}{Please don't let us down, it's our only chance}
{103}{}{请不要让我们失望，这是我们唯一的机会}
#{110}{}{Thank you, wanderer. Thank you for everything!}
{110}{}{谢谢你，流浪者。谢谢你所做的一切！}
#{111}{}{You are welcome.}
{111}{}{不客气。}
#{120}{}{Oh, I'm surprised to see a kindred soul in the closed area.}
{120}{}{哦，我很惊讶在禁区里看到一个有血缘关系的人。}
#{121}{}{What are you talking about?}
{121}{}{你在说什么？}
#{122}{}{Well, not often you meet here people from behind the perimeter. I'm one of the few who... Uh, I got a lucky chance to live here.}
{122}{}{嗯，你不常在这里遇到从外围来的人。我是少数几个...呃，我有幸住在这里。}
#{123}{}{I see. Can I ask you about Wind of War?}
{123}{}{我懂了。我能问一下战争之风吗？}
#{124}{}{Well, then nice to meet you. Maybe I'll stop by sometime to visit.}
{124}{}{很高兴见到你。也许我什么时候过来看看。}
#{125}{}{Of course! Really looking forward to - there's always something to talk about with strangers.}
{125}{}{当然！真的很期待-总有一些事情可以和陌生人聊聊。}
#{126}{}{Uh, okay.}
{126}{}{呃，好吧。}
#{130}{}{Well, shall we sit down and talk?}
{130}{}{好吧，我们坐下来谈谈好吗？}
#{131}{}{I'd like to know more about the settlement. Tell me, please.}
{131}{}{我想了解更多关于和解的情况。请告诉我。}
#{132}{}{Tell me about yourself. As I see, you are not the local, right?}
{132}{}{跟我说说你自己。在我看来，你不是本地人，对吧？}
#{133}{}{}
{133}{}{}
#{134}{}{Thanks for the hospitality, but I gotta go.}
{134}{}{谢谢你的款待，但我得走了。}
#{140}{}{Now we are in a closed community. Only the military and their families live here. Outside you'll find nothing except ruins. Oh, and also, the caravan camp at the train station.}
{140}{}{现在我们在一个封闭的社区里。只有军人和他们的家人住在这里。外面除了废墟什么也找不到。哦，还有火车站的大篷车营地。}
#{141}{}{Why do you call yourself "military"?}
{141}{}{你为什么自称“军人”？}
#{142}{}{How did this community arose, and who are all these people?}
{142}{}{这个群体是怎么产生的，这些人都是谁？}
#{143}{}{What the locals are doing?}
{143}{}{当地人在干什么？}
#{148}{}{Tell me about yourself.}
{148}{}{跟我说说你自己。}
#{149}{}{I guess that's all I wanted to know.}
{149}{}{我想这就是我想知道的。}
#{150}{}{The ancestors, those who founded the Wind of War, were calling themselves such. They were the military, they served the United States. At least, so we were told. Now it is difficult to say. General Wesker believes in the revival of the country, so he's trying to keep the spirit of the nation. And sometimes it even looks stupid.}
{150}{}{那些创造战争之风的祖先们称自己是这样的。他们是军人，为美国服务。至少，我们被告知。现在很难说。韦斯克将军相信国家的复兴，所以他努力保持民族精神。有时甚至看起来很愚蠢。}
#{151}{}{The bulk of the population are direct descendants of the people from the local vault. Ancestors survived the Great War underground, and when it became impossible to live there, they left the vault and established a settlement on the ruins of the old town of Pahrump. Then, gradually, wanderers of the Wasteland started to join the ranks of the settlers, but there were few of lucky ones. Looking at people from the outside world, the General became horrified and... Enclosed the area with a fence. Now random people are not allowed here.}
{151}{}{大部分人口是当地避难所居民的直系后裔。祖先们从地下的大战中幸存下来，当无法在那里生活时，他们离开了地下室，在帕伦普老城的废墟上建立了一个定居点。后来，渐渐地，荒原上的流浪者开始加入定居者的行列，但幸运者寥寥无几。看着外面的人，将军吓坏了...用栅栏围起来。现在这里不允许随便找人。}
#{152}{}{In fact, there are three types of people. First, the military. They protect us, explore the area around, and engage in major hunts. Second, those, who sit in the office and do the brainwork. And finally, the commoners, such as I, whose destiny is to cook porridge, iron clothes and maintain the housing.}
{152}{}{事实上，有三种类型的人。首先，军队。他们保护我们，探索周围的地区，并进行大规模的狩猎。第二，那些坐在办公室里做脑力劳动的人。最后，像我这样的平民，他们的命运就是煮粥、熨衣服、养房子。}
#{153}{}{Vault? Where is it?}
{153}{}{拱顶？它在哪里？}
#{154}{}{I don't even know. It's somewhere in the North-West mountains. Better ask the radio operators at the headquarters - they know everything about the outskirts of the settlement.}
{154}{}{我都不知道。在西北山区的某个地方。最好问问总部的无线电接线员――他们知道定居点外围的一切。}
#{160}{}{I'm here for three or four years. I was accepted because I did good work for the benefit of the Wind of War - helped them with contacting the outside world. But if not for Jessica, I would have go back to the Wasteland.}
{160}{}{我在这里呆了三四年。我之所以被录取，是因为我为《战风》的利益做了很好的工作――帮助他们与外界联系。但如果不是杰西卡，我会回到荒原。}
#{161}{}{Who's Jessica?}
{161}{}{谁是杰西卡？}
#{162}{}{Sounds like you're dissatisfied with life in the Wind of War.}
{162}{}{听起来你对战争中的生活不满意。}
#{163}{}{What's stopping you to leave the settlement?}
{163}{}{是什么阻止你离开营地？}
#{164}{}{Then tell me some more about the settlement.}
{164}{}{那就多告诉我一些关于定居点的事。}
#{170}{}{Oh, this is my first and only love! Before I always thought only about myself until I met her. She lives in the house nearby.}
{170}{}{哦，这是我第一次也是唯一的爱！以前我总是只想着自己，直到我遇到她。她住在附近的房子里。}
#{171}{}{Hmm. Can I trust you? Because I'm a wanderer like you... You know, it's not so bad here, if you find common ground with the "purebred" population. And I used to live in a different environment... But who am I kidding? Me, as a "half-breed" here have no respect, I'm not even allowed to have a family. But I'd be a good husband, damn it!}
{171}{}{嗯。我能相信你吗？因为我和你一样是个流浪者...你知道，如果你能和“纯种”群体找到共同点的话，这里还不错。我以前住在不同的环境里...但我在跟谁开玩笑呢？我，作为一个“混血儿”在这里没有尊重，我甚至不允许有一个家庭。但我会是个好丈夫，该死！}
#{172}{}{Eh... Actually I can leave at any time. But they won't let Jessica do the same. Moreover, they even forbid me to talk to her! After I've proposed to her, her brothers called me a half-breed and kicked out of the house. And without her I see no reason to leave.}
{172}{}{呃...其实我随时都可以离开。但他们不会让杰西卡做同样的事。而且，他们甚至禁止我和她说话！我向她求婚后，她的兄弟们叫我混血儿，把我赶出了家门。没有她我就没有理由离开。}
#{173}{}{Whoa! What's the problem, Romeo? Run out of the settlement together!}
{173}{}{哇！怎么了，罗密欧？一起跑出营地！}
#{174}{}{Are you serious? Damn, I thought about it so many times. Do you really think that it would be wise?}
{174}{}{你是认真的吗？该死，我想了很多次。你真的认为这样做明智吗？}
#{175}{}{Hell, Yes! Ignore the brothers, do what you both want! Who are they to decide for you?}
{175}{}{见鬼，是的！别理兄弟们，做你们两个都想做的！他们是谁来替你决定？}
#{176}{}{You know, that's not so smart. The Wasteland is dangerous, here at least you are protected.}
{176}{}{你知道，那不太聪明。荒地很危险，至少你在这里受到保护。}
#{177}{}{[Sighs] That's right. Well, thanks for the visit.}
{177}{}{[叹息]没错。嗯，谢谢你的来访。}
#{178}{}{Yeah, don't worry! I'm kidding. In fact, you must escape!}
{178}{}{是的，别担心！我开玩笑的。事实上，你必须逃跑！}
#{179}{}{Yeah, bye.}
{179}{}{好的，再见。}
#{180}{}{Yes! Yes!! Thank you, friend! For the support and all. The only thing left is to put out a plan. I have been thinking about running away together for a very long time, but it's hard to do.}
{180}{}{对！对！！谢谢你，朋友！感谢大家的支持。唯一剩下的就是制定一个计划。我一直在想一起逃走很长时间了，但很难做到。}
#{181}{}{I'll help. What do you need?}
{181}{}{我会帮忙的。你需要什么？}
#{182}{}{Well, you should figure it out yourself. I have other things to do.}
{182}{}{好吧，你应该自己想办法。我还有别的事要做。}
#{183}{}{It will not be easy. The brothers keep Jessica locked up and will not release her without supervision. We can run away only at night, when they sleep. But there's the problem - only the brothers have the keys to the door.}
{183}{}{这并不容易。兄弟俩把杰西卡关起来，在没有监督的情况下不会释放她。我们只能在晚上他们睡觉的时候逃跑。但问题是只有兄弟俩才有门的钥匙。}
#{184}{}{So, you need to get the keys to the door?}
{184}{}{所以，你需要拿到门的钥匙？}
#{185}{}{But keep in mind, they shouldn't suspect anything. If both brothers lose the keys, it will raise suspicions, but if they lose only one of them, they will explain the loss by their own confusion, or so I think.}
{185}{}{但请记住，他们不应该怀疑任何事情。如果两兄弟都丢了钥匙，会引起怀疑，但如果他们只丢了一把钥匙，他们会用自己的困惑来解释损失，或者我认为是这样。}
#{186}{}{All right. I'll see what I can do.}
{186}{}{好吧。我看看我能做什么。}
#{190}{}{There you are, friend. Well, how's it going?}
{190}{}{你来了，朋友。怎么样了？}
#{191}{}{I have the key!}
{191}{}{我有钥匙！}
#{192}{}{All easier. No brothers - no problems with the door.}
{192}{}{更容易。没有兄弟-门没问题。}
#{193}{}{There is nothing to make you happy with, at least yet. Wait for the news.}
{193}{}{没有什么能让你开心的，至少现在是这样。等待消息。}
#{194}{}{Wait a minute, you snatched both keys? Oh no! What are you doing?! Bring back one of the keys until they come to their senses! Now!}
{194}{}{等等，你把钥匙都抢了？哦，不！你在做什么？把其中一把钥匙拿回来，直到他们恢复知觉！现在！}
#{195}{}{Okay, okay...}
{195}{}{好吧，好吧...}
#{196}{}{Great! Good job, now the most important thing is to find a suitable time to mount the barricades.}
{196}{}{太好了！干得好，现在最重要的是找个合适的时间登上路障。}
#{197}{}{The barricades?}
{197}{}{路障？}
#{198}{}{Well, of course. They won't allow us to pass through the gates, thus we have to climb over the piles of junk on the perimeter.}
{198}{}{好吧，当然。他们不允许我们通过大门，因此我们不得不翻越周围的垃圾堆。}
#{199}{}{You will need a rope.}
{199}{}{你需要一根绳子。}
#{200}{}{Exactly! I know that the technician had one, if he hasn't sold it already. Please get us a rope!}
{200}{}{确切地！我知道技师有一个，如果他还没有卖掉的话。请给我们拿根绳子！}
#{201}{}{Okay, but I need something in exchange for it.}
{201}{}{好吧，但我需要一些东西来交换。}
#{202}{}{Okay, you'll get the rope.}
{202}{}{好的，你去拿绳子。}
#{203}{}{Hell, I've risked my life enough already, now it's up to you to get out of here, and I'm leaving.}
{203}{}{见鬼，我已经冒了足够的生命危险，现在该由你离开这里了，我要走了。}
#{204}{}{Yes, I... Understand. Thank you anyway. Although without your help we cannot escape, but - thanks.}
{204}{}{是的，我...明白。无论如何谢谢你。虽然没有你的帮助我们无法逃脱，但是-谢谢。}
#{205}{}{Yeah. Goodbye.}
{205}{}{是 啊。再见。}
#{206}{}{Oh, sure, I'm sorry. But I don't have a shop here. I have little to offer except these flasks. They would've been useful in the Wasteland, but we need the rope more.}
{206}{}{哦，当然，对不起。但我这里没有商店。除了这些烧瓶，我几乎没有什么可以提供的。它们在荒地里本来是有用的，但我们更需要绳子。}
#{207}{}{Are you insane?! Why the technician would need damn flasks? Give money! And more!}
{207}{}{你疯了吗？！为什么技师需要该死的烧瓶？给我钱！还有更多！}
#{208}{}{Great, It suits me.}
{208}{}{太好了，很适合我。}
#{209}{}{I changed my mind. You need these things more, so I'll look for something out of my pocket.}
{209}{}{我改变主意了。你更需要这些东西，所以我会从口袋里找东西。}
#{210}{}{Uh... Money is more important to us. Well, here's 100 bucks. It's just enough for the rope, and for the efforts.}
{210}{}{Uh...钱对我们来说更重要。好吧，这是100美元。这只够绳子和努力了。}
#{211}{}{Well, that's another matter. Now wait for me.}
{211}{}{好吧，那是另一回事。现在等我。}
#{212}{}{[Gives 3 empty soldier flasks] I hope it's enough.}
{212}{}{[给3个空的士兵烧瓶]我希望够了。}
#{213}{}{Hope and wait for me.}
{213}{}{希望并等待我。}
#{214}{}{Thanks, friend!}
{214}{}{谢谢，朋友！}
#{215}{}{It's nothing. Wait, when I get the rope.}
{215}{}{没什么。等我拿到绳子的时候。}
#{216}{}{About the purchase of the rope - I need something to exchange for it.}
{216}{}{关于买绳子的事-我需要些东西来换。}
#{220}{}{Hello. I'm sorry it's a mess...}
{220}{}{你好。很抱歉，这里一团糟...}
#{221}{}{I got you the rope.}
{221}{}{我把绳子给你了。}
#{222}{}{Nevermind, I'm leaving.}
{222}{}{没关系，我要走了。}
#{223}{}{Really? Oh, that's great. Give it to me...}
{223}{}{真正地？哦，太好了。把它给我...}
#{224}{}{Not so fast! Tell me, why should I help you? Why can't I just give away you?}
{224}{}{别那么快！告诉我，我为什么要帮你？为什么我不能放弃你？}
#{225}{}{Here you go. I hope this will help you.}
{225}{}{干得好。我希望这对你有帮助。}
#{226}{}{Sorry, I left it in another place.}
{226}{}{对不起，我把它忘在别的地方了。}
#{227}{}{I understand. Well, I know how to "thank" you for trying. But only after you help us. If you want to be exact - I'll tell you about a cache of very useful things. In any case, you won't come off a loser.}
{227}{}{我理解。好吧，我知道如何“感谢”你的努力。但只有在你帮助我们之后。如果你想说得准确的话，我会告诉你一些非常有用的东西。不管怎样，你都不会成为一个失败者。}
#{228}{}{That's fine with me. Well, then hold the rope.}
{228}{}{我没意见。好吧，那就抓住绳子。}
#{229}{}{Sorry, but no. I'll be back if I change my mind.}
{229}{}{对不起，不行。如果我改变主意我会回来的。}
#{230}{}{Hmm, I think that's enough. Well, there is only one thing left. We should escape at night, otherwise we can easily be detected and caught. But the barricades to the North of the Jessica's house are lit by the street lamp. I'm afraid, someone will have to stay and turn off electricity, while we go to the other side.}
{230}{}{嗯，我觉得够了。嗯，只剩下一件事了。我们应该在晚上逃跑，否则我们很容易被发现和抓住。但杰西卡家北面的路障被路灯照亮了。恐怕得有人留下来关掉电源，而我们要去另一边。}
#{231}{}{Ha, don't pretend that you've just realized this, I see when the emotions are staged. Well, I got the hint. I will be the switch that turns the electricity off. Who else but me!}
{231}{}{哈，别装作你刚刚意识到了这一点，我看到情绪在上演。嗯，我明白了。我将成为切断电源的开关。除了我还有谁！}
#{232}{}{Look for another fool, I did my job and am out of here.}
{232}{}{再找一个傻瓜，我做了我的工作，现在就离开这里。}
#{233}{}{Well, then it's time to begin the active phase! All you need to do is wait until night and turn off the lighting on the street.}
{233}{}{好吧，那是时候开始活跃的阶段了！你所要做的就是等到晚上把街上的灯关掉。}
#{234}{}{Sure. Let's get started!}
{234}{}{当然。我们开始吧！}
#{235}{}{Probably, but I'm not ready yet. You will have to wait.}
{235}{}{可能吧，但我还没准备好。你得等等。}
#{236}{}{You haven't changed your mind yet?}
{236}{}{你还没改变主意？}
#{237}{}{I will be the switch that turns the electricity off. Who else but me!}
{237}{}{我将成为切断电源的开关。除了我还有谁！}
#{238}{}{Unfortunately for you - I'll pass.}
{238}{}{对你来说很不幸-我不干了。}
#{239}{}{}
{239}{}{}
#{240}{}{What?! Damn! How did you manage to do this? However, it is not necessary to explain, I don't want to know. The main thing now is to seize the moment to climb the barricades.}
{240}{}{什么？！该死！你是怎么做到的？不过，没必要解释，我不想知道。现在最主要的是抓住时机爬上路障。}
#{1110}{}{Thank you, wanderer. Thank you for everything!}
{1110}{}{谢谢你，流浪者。谢谢你所做的一切！}
#{1177}{}{[Sigh] That's right. Well, thanks for the visit.}
{1177}{}{[叹息]没错。嗯，谢谢你的来访。}
#{1180}{}{Yes! Yes!! Thank you, friend! For the support and all. It's only left to figure out a plan. I have been thinking about running away together for a very long time, but it's hard to do.}
{1180}{}{对！对！！谢谢你，朋友！感谢大家的支持。只有想出一个计划了。我一直在想一起逃走很长时间了，但很难做到。}
#{1190}{}{There you are, friend. Well, how's it going?}
{1190}{}{你来了，朋友。怎么样了？}
#{1194}{}{Wait a minute, you snatched both keys? Oh no! What are you doing?! Bring back one of the keys until they come to their senses! Now!}
{1194}{}{等等，你把钥匙都抢了？哦，不！你在做什么？把其中一把钥匙拿回来，直到他们恢复知觉！现在！}
#{1203}{}{Hell, I've risked my life enough already, now it's up to you to get out of here, and I'm leaving.}
{1203}{}{见鬼，我已经冒了足够的生命危险，现在该由你离开这里了，我要走了。}
#{1209}{}{I changed my mind. You need these things more, so I'll look for something out of my pocket.}
{1209}{}{我改变主意了。你更需要这些东西，所以我会从口袋里找东西。}
#{1214}{}{Thanks, friend!}
{1214}{}{谢谢，朋友！}
#{1221}{}{I got you a rope.}
{1221}{}{我给你拿了根绳子。}
#{1226}{}{Sorry, I left it in another place.}
{1226}{}{对不起，我把它忘在别的地方了。}
#{1231}{}{Ha, don't pretend that you've just realized this, I see when the emotions are staged. Well, I got the hint. I will be the switch that turns the electricity off. Who else but me!}
{1231}{}{哈，别装作你刚刚意识到了这一点，我看到情绪在上演。嗯，我明白了。我将成为切断电源的开关。除了我还有谁！}
#{1232}{}{Look for another fool, I did my job and am out of here.}
{1232}{}{再找一个傻瓜，我做了我的工作，现在就离开这里。}
#{1235}{}{Probably, but I'm not ready yet. You will have to wait.}
{1235}{}{可能吧，但我还没准备好。你得等等。}
#{1236}{}{You haven't changed your mind yet?}
{1236}{}{你还没改变主意？}
