{10}{}{[这位年轻的科学家注意到你向他靠近――尽管，他看的是奇美拉，而不是你]真的吗？所以，理查兹终于给我弄到了一个标本？[他慢慢走向这个生物，默默地盯着它看了一会儿，然后摸了摸它]哦。。。多么…乐器啊。[他转向你]提醒我，你叫什么名字？ -- [the young scientist notices you approaching him - although, he looks at the Chimera, not you] Really?

{30}{}{真正地我可以说我很惊讶。。。高兴地感到惊讶。我希望你帮个忙。。。向科学致敬。还有整个奥林匹斯山。而这个恩惠直接关系到这个奇美拉。有一个。。。令人讨厌的返祖现象，减缓了我们的前沿研究。他的名字叫康斯坦丁・佐奇基斯。我们就不同类型武器的有效性进行了争论，他说我的方法是。。。令人质疑，让我们这样说吧。我想证明他错了。你想参加奥林巴斯的军备竞赛吗？ -- Really?

### {50}{}{Oh... Perfect! There's a way to deal with our argument with incredible elegance. Zochkis is sitting at his office, locking himself into his motorized armor suit, because he has a strong delusion of persecution - but that's not related to the case. What is, however, is that he is afraid of Chimeras, like a little girl! But at the same time, he says that Chimeras can't be used for the defense of Olympus, because they are not very effective. So, I want you to take a Chimera and to go have a talk with this old bore. Make him attack the Chimera, so we could find out what's more effective - his armor suit or claws of my new pet. Although, if he dies in the process - I wouldn't mind... And be quite pleased too.}
{50}{}{哦完美的有一种方法可以以令人难以置信的优雅处理我们的论点。佐奇基斯坐在办公室里，把自己锁在机动装甲服里，因为他有一种强烈的迫害妄想――但这与案件无关。然而，他害怕奇美拉斯，就像一个小女孩！但同时，他说Chimeras不能用于奥林巴斯的防御，因为它们不是很有效。所以，我想让你带上奇美拉，去和这个老无聊的人谈谈。让他攻击奇美拉，这样我们就可以找到更有效的东西――他的盔甲套装或我新宠物的爪子。虽然，如果他在这个过程中死亡，我不会介意。。。我也很高兴。 -- Oh...
