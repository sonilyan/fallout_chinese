#{100}{}{You see a nervous man.}
{100}{}{你看到一个紧张的人。}
#{150}{}{You see Blaster's keeper.}
{150}{}{你看到爆能者的守护者了。}
#{200}{}{You see a man who is apparently very busy. He is rummaging through the shelf in front of him.}
{200}{}{你看到一个显然很忙的人。他在翻找面前的架子。}
#{250}{}{You see Blaster's keeper. He appears busy.}
{250}{}{你看到爆能者的守护者了。他看起来很忙。}
#{300}{}{Leave!}
{300}{}{快走！}
#{301}{}{Your choice.}
{301}{}{你的选择。}
#{302}{}{Your choice.}
{302}{}{你的选择。}
#{303}{}{There is nothing left to say.}
{303}{}{没什么好说的了。}
#{304}{}{I have nothing else to tell you.}
{304}{}{我没有别的要告诉你。}
#{400}{}{There is one of Uncle's spies here!}
{400}{}{这里有一个叔叔的间谍！}
#{401}{}{There is a spy here!}
{401}{}{这里有个间谍！}
#{402}{}{You're a madman!}
{402}{}{你是个疯子！}
#{500}{}{[The man turned away from the shelf and frowned at you.] You have no business being here. Unless you're looking for trouble, you should leave immediately.}
{500}{}{[那人从架子上转过身来，对你皱了眉头。]你没必要在这里。除非你找麻烦，否则你应该马上离开。}
#{501}{}{[The man turned away from the shelf and frowned at you.] You have no business being here. Unless you're looking for trouble, you should leave immediately.}
{501}{}{[那人从架子上转过身来，对你皱了眉头。]你没必要在这里。除非你找麻烦，否则你应该马上离开。}
#{502}{}{No worries, I won't be long. Who are you, actually?}
{502}{}{别担心，我不会很久的。你到底是谁？}
#{503}{}{And how are you going to make me do that?}
{503}{}{你打算怎么让我这么做？}
#{504}{}{Very well. I'm leaving.}
{504}{}{很好。我要走了。}
#{505}{}{Eh?}
{505}{}{嗯？}
#{550}{}{Some still consider me to be a doctor, but that's not true for a long time now. All I do now is taking care of Blaster. [He shoots a brief glance to the other side of the room.] There is plenty of work with him and... Sorry, you really shouldn't be here.}
{550}{}{有些人仍然认为我是一名医生，但这不是真的很长一段时间了。我现在所做的就是照顾爆炸机。[他向房间的另一边瞥了一眼]他有很多工作要做，而且。。。对不起，你真的不应该在这里。}
#{551}{}{Some still consider me to be a doctor, but that's not true for a long time now. All I do now is taking care of Blaster. [He shoots a brief glance to the other side of the room.] There is plenty of work with him and... Sorry, you really shouldn't be here.}
{551}{}{有些人仍然认为我是一名医生，但这不是真的很长一段时间了。我现在所做的就是照顾爆炸机。[他向房间的另一边瞥了一眼]他有很多工作要做，而且。。。对不起，你真的不应该在这里。}
#{552}{}{Yes, I'll be on my way in a minute. But it's still not entirely clear to me what exactly are you doing here.}
{552}{}{是的，我马上就来。但我还是不太清楚你到底在这里干什么。}
#{553}{}{I don't get it, how can it be so much work when your only patient is one supermutant?}
{553}{}{我不明白，当你唯一的病人是一个超级变异体的时候，怎么会有这么多工作？}
#{554}{}{I heard you're keeping Blaster calm so he doesn't run away. Is that right? Not too much of a strain, is it?}
{554}{}{我听说你让爆炸者保持冷静以免他逃跑。是这样吗？不会太紧张吧？}
#{555}{}{And what are you going to do about it?}
{555}{}{你打算怎么办？}
#{556}{}{In that case, goodbye.}
{556}{}{那样的话，再见。}
#{600}{}{Ah... You know, it's not a simple matter to take care of Blaster. After all, he's a supermutant. Even though I can keep him permanently sedated, this only solves part of the troubles. His body has different reactions than a human one, so the dosage must be applied with utmost caution. And he's got some gashes from the last duel in the ring, which... Listen, I really shouldn't be talking about this. Please, leave immediately. And don't come back again.}
{600}{}{啊。。。你知道，照顾Blaster可不是件简单的事。毕竟，他是个超级变种人。即使我能让他永久保持镇静，这也只能解决部分问题。他的身体有不同于人类的反应，所以使用剂量必须非常小心。他在拳击场的最后一次决斗中有一些伤口。。。听着，我真的不该说这个。请马上离开。别再回来了。}
#{601}{}{You should probably know that I'm going to challenge Nestor.}
{601}{}{你应该知道我要挑战内斯特。}
#{602}{}{As you wish. Bye.}
{602}{}{如你所愿。再见。}
#{603}{}{I'm not going anywhere.}
{603}{}{我哪儿也不去。}
#{650}{}{[His face shows fear.] I have no idea what you're trying here, but... Forget it. I don't wish to do something stupid.}
{650}{}{[他脸上露出恐惧]我不知道你在想什么，但是。。。算了吧。我不想做傻事。}
#{651}{}{I just wanted to tell you that. Bye.}
{651}{}{我只是想告诉你。再见。}
#{652}{}{I just wanted to tell you that. Bye.}
{652}{}{我只是想告诉你。再见。}
#{653}{}{Please, help me. I will end up being the next man beaten to death by Blaster, if you don't do anything. Being a doctor, does it not bother you that you're treating a people-killing monster? Especially considering his brutality.}
{653}{}{拜托，帮帮我。如果你什么都不做，我会成为下一个被爆能者打死的人。作为一名医生，你在治疗一个杀人怪物，这不困扰你吗？尤其是考虑到他的残忍。}
#{654}{}{Listen! I'm willing to generously reward you, if you arrange that Blaster gets a stronger dose of drugs before the fight. We help each other.}
{654}{}{听！我愿意慷慨地奖励你，如果你安排爆破手在战斗前得到更大剂量的毒品。我们互相帮助。}
#{655}{}{Listen! I'm willing to generously reward you, if you arrange that Blaster gets a stronger dose of drugs before the fight. We help each other.}
{655}{}{听！我愿意慷慨地奖励你，如果你安排爆破手在战斗前得到更大剂量的毒品。我们互相帮助。}
#{656}{}{In that case, I'll have to make you do it by force!}
{656}{}{那样的话，我只能强迫你这么做！}
#{700}{}{Of course it bothers me, dammit! But it's not my fault that people keep lining up against Blaster in the ring. It's your own choice.}
{700}{}{我当然很烦，该死！但这不是我的错，人们在拳击场上一直排着队对抗爆破手。这是你自己的选择。}
#{701}{}{It's not just about the ring. I have no doubt that one day Blaster will get out of control, and can you imagine the massacre that will follow? All it would take is for you to make a small mistake in his dosage, and he would descend on the townsfolk like a tornado. If I were in your shoes, I definitely wouldn't want to carry that risk on my shoulders. That supermutant is a threat and if this is the only way to stop him, I am willing to take my chances.}
{701}{}{不仅仅是戒指的问题。我毫不怀疑有一天爆炸机会失控，你能想象接下来的大屠杀吗？你只要在他的剂量上犯一个小错误，他就会像龙卷风一样袭击镇民。如果我站在你的立场上，我绝对不想冒这个险。那个超级毛驴是个威胁，如果这是阻止他的唯一方法，我愿意冒险。}

#{750}{}{You must be crazy to risk your life like this. [He sighed.] And I must be even crazier for wanting to help you. Sometimes, I'm truly terrified by thoughts of Blaster escaping due to my mistake. I'll give him a higher dose of drugs before the fight, and it will make him vulnerable. But you should know that supermutants have incredible stamina. Blaster will still be a dangerous opponent. And now go. We shouldn't be seen together.}
{750}{}{你这样冒生命危险一定是疯了。[他叹了口气]我想帮助你，我一定更疯狂了。有时候，我真的很害怕爆炸机逃跑的想法，由于我的错误。我会在战斗前给他更大剂量的药物，这会让他变得脆弱。但是你应该知道超级变种人有惊人的耐力。爆破手仍然是一个危险的对手。现在走吧。我们不应该在一起。}

#{752}{}{I'm counting on you. Goodbye.}
{752}{}{我全靠你了。再见。}
#{800}{}{Don't try this on me. What is your deal? You work for Uncle? That's it, isn't it? You better vanish, or I'll have you killed. Uncle is not popular around here, not one bit.}
{800}{}{别把这个穿在我身上。你的交易是什么？你为叔叔工作？就这样，不是吗？你最好消失，否则我就杀了你。叔叔在这里不受欢迎，一点也不受欢迎。}
#{801}{}{No one threatens ME! Time to die, cripple!}
{801}{}{没有人威胁我！该死了，瘸子！}
#{802}{}{As you wish. Bye.}
{802}{}{如你所愿。再见。}
#{850}{}{If you don't leave immediately, I'm calling Nestor's mercenaries. And for your information, they don't like anyone getting suspiciously close to Blaster.}
{850}{}{如果你不马上离开，我就给内斯特的雇佣兵打电话。告诉你，他们不喜欢任何人可疑地接近爆炸机。}
#{851}{}{If you don't leave immediately, I'm calling Nestor's mercenaries. And for your information, they don't like anyone getting suspiciously close to Blaster.}
{851}{}{如果你不马上离开，我就给内斯特的雇佣兵打电话。告诉你，他们不喜欢任何人可疑地接近爆炸机。}
#{852}{}{Go ahead. They're not gonna save you anyway!}
{852}{}{前进。反正他们也救不了你！}
#{853}{}{As you wish. Bye.}
{853}{}{如你所愿。再见。}
#{854}{}{He? Much yappy-yappy, me kill!}
{854}{}{他？大喊大叫，杀了我！}
#{855}{}{Ghe. Oukeeey.}
{855}{}{唉。奥基。}
#{900}{}{Didn't I tell you that you have no business being here? Leave right now!}
{900}{}{我不是告诉过你你不该来这里吗？马上离开！}
#{901}{}{I only need a little of your time. Who are you, actually?}
{901}{}{我只需要你一点时间。你到底是谁？}
#{902}{}{Yes, I'll be on my way in a minute. But it's still not entirely clear to me what exactly you're doing here with Blaster.}
{902}{}{是的，我马上就来。但我还是不太清楚你到底在这里和Blaster干什么。}
#{903}{}{Surely you can spare a moment. You can't have much work when that supermutant is your only patient.}
{903}{}{你当然可以抽出一点时间。当那个超级变种人是你唯一的病人时，你就不会有太多的工作了。}
#{904}{}{I heard you're keeping Blaster calm so he doesn't bolt away. Is that right? Not too much of a strain, is it?}
{904}{}{我听说你让爆炸者保持冷静，以免他逃跑。是这样吗？不会太紧张吧？}
#{905}{}{You should probably know that I'm going to challenge Nestor.}
{905}{}{你应该知道我要挑战内斯特。}
#{906}{}{I'll stay here until I like it!}
{906}{}{我会待在这里直到我喜欢它！}
#{907}{}{Goodbye then.}
{907}{}{那就再见了。}
#{908}{}{Uh.}
{908}{}{休斯敦大学。}
#{950}{}{No, you leave right now, or I'm calling Nestor's mercs. And for your information, they don't like anyone getting suspiciously close to Blaster.}
{950}{}{不，你现在就走，不然我就打电话给内斯特的水务部。告诉你，他们不喜欢任何人可疑地接近爆炸机。}
#{951}{}{No, you leave right now, or I'm calling Nestor's mercs. And for your information, they don't like anyone getting suspiciously close to Blaster.}
{951}{}{不，你现在就走，不然我就打电话给内斯特的水务部。告诉你，他们不喜欢任何人可疑地接近爆炸机。}
#{1000}{}{Yes, you already mentioned that. Whatever you want... [His face shows fear.] Just forget about it. I have no need to do something dumb.}
{1000}{}{是的，你已经提到了。不管你想要什么。。。[他脸上露出恐惧]算了吧。我不需要做傻事。}
#{1001}{}{Yes, you already mentioned that. Whatever you want... [His face shows fear.] Just forget about it. I have no need to do something dumb.}
{1001}{}{是的，你已经提到了。不管你想要什么。。。[他脸上露出恐惧]算了吧。我不需要做傻事。}
#{1050}{}{Nestor pays me well. And he pays his men just as well. Even though I despise this job, I'm not such a fool as to piss off my boss.}
{1050}{}{内斯特给了我很多钱。他也给他的手下发工资。尽管我鄙视这份工作，但我并不是一个惹老板生气的傻瓜。}
#{1051}{}{Nestor won't be a threat anymore, if you do it. Or are you planning to take care of that demented mutant forever? Nestor wouldn't let you leave easily, right? He needs you. But without Blaster and Nestor, you will be free. And with your savings, you can do whatever you want with your life.}
{1051}{}{如果你这么做，内斯特就不再是威胁了。或者你打算永远照顾那个精神错乱的变种人？内斯特不会让你轻易离开的，对吧？他需要你。但是没有了爆炸机和内斯特，你就自由了。用你的积蓄，你可以做任何你想做的事。}
#{1052}{}{Nestor won't be a threat anymore, if you do it. And I will make sure that you become a rich man. You'll have more caps that you ever dreamed off.}
{1052}{}{如果你这么做，内斯特就不再是威胁了。我会确保你成为一个有钱人。你会有更多你梦寐以求的瓶盖。}
#{1100}{}{I wouldn't like to test how important I'm for Nestor, if it doesn't work. [He sighed.] But you're right that I've had my fill here and Nestor will never let me go. Ok then, I'll do it. But you need to know that supermutants have incredible stamina. Blaster will still remain a formidable opponent. And now leave. We shouldn't be seen together.}
{1100}{}{我不想测试我对内斯特有多重要，如果它不起作用的话。[他叹了口气]但你说得对，我在这里已经吃饱了，内斯特永远不会放我走。好吧，那我就做。但你要知道超级变种人有惊人的耐力。爆炸机仍然是一个强大的对手。现在离开。我们不应该在一起。}
#{1101}{}{I wouldn't like to test how important I'm for Nestor, if it doesn't work. [He sighed.] But you're right that I've had my fill here and Nestor will never let me go. Ok then, I'll do it.
