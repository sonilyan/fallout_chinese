#{500}{}{You're here to see me? [He examined you curiously.] But we don't know each other. No, I didn't see one like that yet, I would remember it. [He keeps looking at you in a creepy way. Based on sheriff's description this is surely Chadwick.]}
{500}{}{你是来看我的？[他好奇地打量了你]但我们彼此不认识。不，我还没见过这样的，我会记得的。[他一直用恐怖的眼神看着你。根据警长的描述，这肯定是查德威克。]}

{650}{}{他，你的舌头不太灵巧。不，不。如果他有证据，他早就来接我了。}
#{651}{}{Are you saying that it wasn't you?}

{800}{}{直接提问，逃脱，hmpf。我可以要求任何东西，不是吗？你为什么这么感兴趣，他？}
#{801}{}{I'm not really, but Francis is interested. He admires that person and wishes to meet him. He himself has a nice collection of little tongues.}
{801}{}{我不太清楚，但弗朗西斯很感兴趣。他很欣赏那个人，希望能见到他。他自己也有一大堆小舌头。}

#{850}{}{Har, and he made a necklace out of them? Ssss... Ehm... My wicked ugly tongue just said more than it should, hm.}
{850}{}{哈，他用它们做了项链？Ssss。。。嗯。。。我那邪恶丑陋的舌头说得太多了，嗯。}
#{851}{}{Oh yes! He does have a beautiful necklace made of tongues.}
{851}{}{哦，是的！他确实有一条用舌头做的漂亮项链。}
#{900}{}{Hehe, I would not expect any understanding from that rough, sharp tongue. He he. But he can't have a prettier necklace than me. No, he can't. I'll show it to him, he will see, mine is nicer, ehm, much prettier.}
{900}{}{呵呵，我可不指望那粗犷尖利的舌头能理解我。他，他。但他没有比我更漂亮的项链了。不，他不能。我给他看，他会看到，我的更好，嗯，更漂亮。}
#{901}{}{Do it, the sooner the better.}
{901}{}{做吧，越快越好。}
#{950}{}{Don't you see the beauty, the grace, mhhmm... A tongue, chosen, carefully chosen, ha ha, is the prettiest jewel. Your tongue is not a beautiful one, no no, but a little sentence about helping slided down from it, he?}
{950}{}{你没看到美丽，优雅，嗯。。。舌头，精挑细选，哈哈，是最漂亮的宝石。你的舌头不漂亮，不，不，但是一句关于帮助的话滑了下来，他？}
#{951}{}{What you just said can be considered a confession.}
{951}{}{你刚才说的话可以算是认罪。}
#{952}{}{A fascinating view. We all see beauty in something else. I'm gonna help you. Why not? It could be... an experience.}
{952}{}{迷人的景色。我们都能从其他事物中看到美。我会帮你的。为什么不？可能是。。。一次经历。}
#{953}{}{Yes, but for an adequate reward, of course.}
{953}{}{是的，当然是为了得到足够的报酬。}
#{954}{}{That's a misunderstanding, I have no wish to help you.}
{954}{}{那是个误会，我不想帮助你。}
#{1000}{}{You're moving it first here and then there, ha ha. It's not gonna lead where you want, no no. How do you prove I said anything, he? Word against word, tongue against tongue.}
{1000}{}{你先搬来搬去，哈哈。它不会带你去你想去的地方，不，不。你怎么证明我说了什么，他？言对言，舌对舌。}
#{1001}{}{Very well, you have a very interesting angle on beauty, I give you that. We all see it in something else. I'm gonna help you. Why not? It could be... an experience.}
{1001}{}{很好，你对美有一个很有趣的角度，我告诉你。我们都在别的地方看到了。我会帮你的。为什么不？可能是。。。一次经历。}
#{1002}{}{Very well, I'm gonna help you, but for a financial reward.}
{1002}{}{很好，我会帮你的，不过是为了经济奖励。}
#{1003}{}{I don't need to prove anything, Francis doesn't want to arrest you. He admires you and would like to meet you. He himself has a collection of nice little tongues.}
{1003}{}{我不需要证明什么，弗朗西斯不想逮捕你。他很欣赏你，很想见你。他自己也有一套漂亮的小舌头。}
#{1004}{}{In that case we are in conflict. And conflicts in this town are resolved in the ring.}
{1004}{}{那样的话，我们就有冲突了。这个镇上的冲突在拳击场上解决了。}
#{1005}{}{Screw it, this is not worth my time.}
{1005}{}{去他妈的，这不值得我花时间。}
#{1050}{}{Ooh, finally someone who isn't blind, mhhhmm, or at least someone trying to see that beauty. My beautiful necklace is missing one last jewel, mmmm, the most... mmm. Help me obtain it! It must be mine, only mine.}
{1050}{}{哦，终于有人不是瞎子了，嗯，或者至少有人想看到那种美。我漂亮的项链少了最后一颗宝石，嗯，最。。。嗯。帮我弄到它！一定是我的，只有我的。}

{1051}{}{你要找哪一个？}
#{1052}{}{A necklace of tongues?! I want nothing to do with you anymore.}
{1052}{}{一条舌头项链？！我不想再和你有任何关系了。}
#{1100}{}{It's a lovely little tongue, mmmm, not very good with words, but otherwise very skilled, har. It was almost mine, but it didn't work out. Oh so close I was. I want it, but it is being watched, the beauty, watched by those ugly eyes. They would know right away and I wouldn't have time to leave the town, oh-oh.}
{1100}{}{这是一个可爱的小舌头，嗯，不是很好的话，但在其他方面非常熟练，哈。差不多是我的，但没成功。哦，我差一点就到了。我想要它，但是它正在被那些丑陋的眼睛注视着，美丽。他们马上就会知道，我就没时间离开这个小镇了。}
#{1101}{}{I see, you mean Susan, the whore who survived the attack? You want me to bring you her tongue?}
{1101}{}{我明白了，你是说苏珊，那个从袭击中幸存下来的妓女？你要我把她的舌头给你吗？}
#{1150}{}{Yes... NO! You must bring the repulsive rest of her here with it, oh. I must remove that jewel myself, only me. Mmmm, it must be precise, not to spoil the marvelous structure. Me, I will do it.}
{1150}{}{对。。。不！你一定要把她剩下的讨厌的部分带到这里来，哦。我必须亲自把那颗宝石摘下来，只有我自己。嗯，一定要精确，不要破坏这个奇妙的结构。我，我会做的。}
#{1151}{}{Understood, I will bring the whore here.}
{1151}{}{明白，我会把妓女带到这里来。}
#{1152}{}{I'm not gonna do that. Bye.}
{1152}{}{我不会那么做的。再见。}
#{1200}{}{Aaah yes, you're not interested in beauty, you want riches, eh? Well, such people are also needed sometimes, yes. My beautiful necklace is missing one last jewel, mmmm, the most... mmm. Help me obtain it and I will pay you. It must be mine, only mine.}
{1200}{}{啊，是的，你对美不感兴趣，你想要财富，是吗？嗯，有时候也需要这样的人，是的。我漂亮的项链少了最后一颗宝石，嗯，最。。。嗯。帮我弄到它，我就付钱给你。一定是我的，只有我的。}

#{1251}{}{Are you claiming that you have nothing to do with them?}
{1251}{}{你是说你和他们没有关系吗？}
#{1252}{}{Yes, I claim you did it. If you say otherwise we are in conflict. And conflicts in this town are resolved in the ring.}
{1252}{}{是的，我声称是你干的。如果你不这么说，我们就有冲突了。这个镇上的冲突在拳击场上解决了。}
#{1253}{}{There still isn't a reasonable discussion to be had with you, bye.}
{1253}{}{我们还是没什么好商量的，再见。}
#{1300}{}{Where is it, where? I'm waiting for that little tongue and still nothing, aaah. Bring her to me, she doesn't deserve it, it will be decorating me, only me!}
{1300}{}{在哪里，在哪里？我在等那小舌头，但还是什么都没有，啊。把她带到我这里来，她不配，那会装饰我，只有我！}
#{1301}{}{I talked to Francis and you know what, he admires you and would like to meet you. He himself has a collection of nice little tongues.}
