# Before the quest
### {200}{}{Hey, hey, this is my house. What do you want here?}
{200}{}{嘿，嘿，这是我的房子。你想在这里干什么？}
### {201}{}{I'm a thief.}
{201}{}{我是个小偷。}
### {202}{}{That's how. Fine. Great. It's just magical. Get out of here, you fool!}
{202}{}{就是这样。好的太棒了这太神奇了。滚出去，你这个傻瓜！}
### {1202}{}{That's how. Fine. Great. It's just magical... Get out of here, cheeky!}
{1202}{}{就是这样。好的太棒了这太神奇了...滚出去，厚脸皮！}
### {203}{}{Bye.}
{203}{}{再见}
### {204}{}{Hey, it's just a joke. I'm your new neighbor.}
{204}{}{嘿，这只是个玩笑。我是你的新邻居。}
### {1204}{}{Hey, it's just a joke. I'm your new neighbor.}
{1204}{}{嘿，这只是个玩笑。我是你的新邻居。}
### {205}{}{Listen, who are you kidding? No one has been going to our city on their own for a long time. There is no work here! But if you really want to live next door, then do me a favor - don't bother me.}
{205}{}{听着，你在跟谁开玩笑？很长一段时间没有人独自去我们的城市了。这里没有工作！但如果你真的想住在隔壁，那就帮我一个忙――别打扰我。}
### {206}{}{Okay. Whatever you say.}
{206}{}{可以不管你说什么。}
### {207}{}{I want to meet new neighbors.}

### {211}{}{Why so much distrust of neighbors?}
{211}{}{为什么这么不信任邻居？}
### {212}{}{Okay. Whatever you say.}
{212}{}{可以不管你说什么。}
### {213}{}{You can't trust anyone in this city. Even to your neighbors, who are only looking at your good. It's worth going out the door - and here someone climbs into your lock with a lock pick.}
{213}{}{你不能相信这个城市的任何人。即使是你的邻居，他们也只是在看你的好。出门是值得的――这里有人拿着撬锁爬进你的锁。}
### {214}{}{Was something stolen from you?}
{214}{}{你的东西被偷了吗？}
### {215}{}{Yes, everyone here has something that periodically disappears. It started as soon as things in the mine began to decline and a lot of workers were left without earnings.}
{215}{}{是的，这里的每个人都有周期性消失的东西。当矿井的情况开始好转，许多工人没有收入时，情况就开始了。}
### {216}{}{What exactly was stolen from you?}
{216}{}{你到底偷了什么？}
### {217}{}{Welding machine. This is a very valuable item. There are only a few such devices in working condition for the whole city. He's been giving me a great income so far. But what should I do now?}
{217}{}{焊接机。这是一件非常珍贵的物品。整个城市只有少数这样的设备处于工作状态。到目前为止，他给了我很大的收入。但我现在该怎么办？}
### {218}{}{I see. I can look for the missing.}
{218}{}{我明白了。我可以去找失踪的人。}
### {219}{}{Really? Or maybe it's a cunning plan - to steal first and then resell? Although why am I? You're new here, and the loss happened much earlier. Okay, if you find my things, I'll try to buy them back.}
{219}{}{真正地或者这可能是一个狡猾的计划――先偷窃，然后转售？尽管为什么是我？你是新来的，损失发生得更早。好吧，如果你找到我的东西，我会设法把它们买回来。}
### {220}{}{Okay, I'll do it.}
{220}{}{好吧，我来做。}
### {221}{}{Don't worry about it. The thief will be punished. After all, as a ranger, I swore to protect the law in these lands.}

{1221}{}{别担心，小偷会受到惩罚的。毕竟，作为一名护林员，我发誓要保护这些土地上的法律。}

{222}{}{嘿，嘿，那么你是个护林员？为什么我会在最后一刻发现？我不需要那样的东西，我是自由居民，我不会跪在你面前！}
### {223}{}{It's not your concern anymore. I'll deal with the thief, whether you want it or not. Wait for the result.}
{223}{}{这不再是你关心的问题了。不管你愿不愿意，我都会对付这个小偷。等待结果。}

#After receiving the quest
### {230}{}{You again? What do you need?}
{230}{}{你又来了？你需要什么？}
### {231}{}{Is that what they've been saying about you lately? Well, to what do I owe your visit?}
{231}{}{这就是他们最近对你的评价吗？那么，我欠你什么？}
### {232}{}{Hello, neighbor. What's new?}
{232}{}{你好，邻居。有什么新鲜事？}
### {233}{}{Yes, I just wanted to say hello before leaving.}
{233}{}{是的，我只是想在离开前打个招呼。}

### {240}{}{What are you doing, Frank?}
{240}{}{你在干什么，弗兰克？}
### {241}{}{I make statues, baby. They sell well all over the Wasteland.}
{241}{}{我做雕像，宝贝。他们在荒原上卖得很好。}
### {242}{}{Must be a profitable business?}
{242}{}{一定是有利可图的生意吗？}
### {243}{}{Seriously?}
{243}{}{认真地}
### {244}{}{And what else is there to do in this hole? I used to work in a cartel like the others. Mined and repaired old things. Except there's almost no work left in the city, I'm barely making ends meet.}
{244}{}{在这个洞里还能做什么？我曾经和其他人一样在卡特尔工作。挖掘和修理旧东西。除了城市里几乎没有工作了，我几乎入不敷出。}
### {245}{}{Sorry. Can I ask you another question?}
{245}{}{很抱歉我能再问你一个问题吗？}
### {246}{}{A sad story. Later.}

### {253}{}{Any idea who could do this?}
{253}{}{知道谁能做到这一点吗？}
### {254}{}{If I had any ideas, I would have found and returned my device a long time ago. Obviously, the thief will not shine them for a very long time. Here you need to act with cunning so that the thief gives himself away.}
{254}{}{如果我有任何想法，我早就找到并归还了我的设备。很明显，小偷在很长一段时间内都不会发光。在这里，你需要狡猾行事，这样小偷才会暴露自己。}
### {255}{}{I see.}
{255}{}{我明白了。}
### {256}{}{Here's your welding machine.}
{256}{}{这是你的焊机。}
### {257}{}{It's really him. And I thought it was hopeless. So who was the thief?}
{257}{}{真的是他。我觉得这是无望的。那个小偷是谁？}
### {258}{}{He was, uh, lying in a dump. I don't know who put it there.}
{258}{}{他躺在垃圾堆里。我不知道是谁放的。}
### {259}{}{Hmm, either you have incredible instincts, or you're just covering for a thief. Thanks anyway. Here are yours }
{259}{}{嗯，要么你有不可思议的直觉，要么你只是在为小偷做掩护。无论如何，谢谢。这是你的}
