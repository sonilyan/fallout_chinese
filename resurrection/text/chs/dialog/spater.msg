#{100}{}{You see a man.}
{100}{}{你看到一个男人。}
#{150}{}{You see Father Malcolm.}
{150}{}{你看到马尔科姆神父了。}
#{200}{}{You see a man wearing glasses and a coat that might have been white once.}
{200}{}{你看到一个男人戴着眼镜和一件可能曾经是白色的外套。}
#{250}{}{You see Father Malcolm, a local drug dealer.}
{250}{}{你看马尔科姆神父，一个当地的毒贩。}
#{400}{}{God's wrath will send you to your knees.}
{400}{}{上帝的愤怒会让你跪下。}
#{401}{}{Go back to the Abyss!}
{401}{}{回到深渊去！}
#{402}{}{I am blessed by our Lord, you cannot win.}
{402}{}{上帝保佑我，你赢不了。}
#{500}{}{Aah, a new lamb seeking my blessing! Welcome to my shrine.}
{500}{}{啊，一只寻求我祝福的新羔羊！欢迎来到我的神殿。}
#{501}{}{Who are you?}
{501}{}{你是谁？}
#{502}{}{Eh, sorry, wrong door.}
{502}{}{呃，对不起，走错门了。}
#{503}{}{Hoo?}
{503}{}{呼？}
#{504}{}{Hoohaa.}
{504}{}{你好。}
#{550}{}{My name's Malcolm but my flock calls me Father. [He points at the junkies lying around.]}
{550}{}{我叫马尔科姆，但我的羊群叫我父亲。[他指着周围躺着的吸毒者。]}
#{551}{}{What exactly do you offer here?}
{551}{}{你们这里到底提供什么？}
#{552}{}{Nothing that might interest me.}
{552}{}{没什么能让我感兴趣的。}
#{600}{}{What do I offer? God's nourishment, that's what. Nourishment that will provide you with divine experience. I offer you elevation! So close at hand. That is what I offer here.}
{600}{}{我能提供什么？上帝的滋养，就是这样。为你提供神圣体验的营养。我给你提升！近在咫尺。这就是我在这里提供的。}
#{601}{}{In that case, I'm interested.}
{601}{}{那样的话，我很感兴趣。}
#{602}{}{What you mean is you're selling drugs, right?}
{602}{}{你的意思是你在卖毒品，对吧？}
#{603}{}{What do the police say about it?}
{603}{}{警察怎么说？}
#{604}{}{What does senor Rodriguez say about it?}
{604}{}{罗德里格斯先生怎么说？}
#{605}{}{I'm not interested.}
{605}{}{我不感兴趣。}
#{650}{}{Some people call it that. But can one poor word give justice to God's gifts? No words do them justice, they have to be felt through all of one's senses.}
{650}{}{有人这么叫。但一句可怜的话能公正地对待上帝的恩赐吗？任何语言都不能公正地表达它们，它们必须通过人的所有感官来感受。}
#{651}{}{In that case, I'm interested.}
{651}{}{那样的话，我很感兴趣。}
#{652}{}{What do the police say about it?}
{652}{}{警察怎么说？}
#{653}{}{What does senor Rodriguez say about it?}
{653}{}{罗德里格斯先生怎么说？}
#{654}{}{I don't want any drugs. Bye.}
{654}{}{我不要任何毒品。再见。}
#{700}{}{Lost Town's not really their territory. That means police officers have a difficult access to my blessings. Still I try to deliver God's gifts to those who are seeking elevation. It's not easy, though, their infernal work orders them not to accept them.}
{700}{}{迷失之城不是他们的地盘。这意味着警察很难得到我的祝福。但我仍要把神的恩赐赐给那些寻求升天的人。不过，这并不容易，他们那该死的工作命令他们不要接受他们。}
#{701}{}{So, what do you offer?}
{701}{}{那么，你提供什么？}
#{702}{}{What does senor Rodriguez say about it?}
{702}{}{罗德里格斯先生怎么说？}
#{703}{}{Good-bye.}
{703}{}{再见。}
#{750}{}{Everything happening here has been blessed by him. He even provides protection to my temple for a small provision from the sales.}
{750}{}{这里发生的一切都是他保佑的。他甚至为我的庙宇提供保护，从销售中得到一小部分。}
#{751}{}{I see.}
{751}{}{我懂了。}
#{800}{}{I have plenty of God's gifts here for a laughingly low price, considering the pleasure they offer to one's senses. And then there is... [He breathes in through his nose loudly.] My own creation! I call it "Elevation".}
{800}{}{考虑到上帝的恩赐给人的感官带来的愉悦，我这里有很多上帝的恩赐，价格低得可笑。还有……[他用鼻子大声吸气]我自己创造的！我称之为“提升”。}
#{801}{}{Show me what you've got.}
{801}{}{给我看看你有什么。}
#{802}{}{I'm interested in the "Elevation" thing.}
{802}{}{我对“提升”感兴趣。}
#{803}{}{No thanks, I'm not interested.}
{803}{}{不，谢谢，我不感兴趣。}
#{850}{}{First you have to understand. God created many substances that seem to be without purpose. But he gave us that gift, the ability to alter and combine them and thus create His gifts. "Elevation" is my creation, my ability. But you cannot rise up immediately, you have to proceed in small doses. A single deep inhalation for 500 caps will make you rise. Not more! Even the angels themselves cannot go too close to the Sun lest their wings should burn up.}
{850}{}{首先你要明白。上帝创造了许多似乎毫无目的的物质。但是他给了我们这种天赋，改变和组合它们的能力，从而创造了他的天赋。”“提升”是我的创造，我的能力。但是你不能马上站起来，你必须小剂量地进行。一次深吸500个瓶盖就能让你站起来。不要再多了！即使是天使自己也不能离太阳太近，以免他们的翅膀烧毁。}
#{851}{}{Here's 500 caps, I want to try it.}
{851}{}{这有500瓶盖，我想试试。}
#{852}{}{I don't have 500 caps.}
{852}{}{我没有500瓶盖。}
#{853}{}{Isn't it hazardous to one's health?}
{853}{}{对人的健康不有害吗？}
#{854}{}{I think I'd like to see what else you've got to offer, instead.}
{854}{}{我想我想看看你还能提供什么。}
#{855}{}{I'm not interested in this.}
{855}{}{我对此不感兴趣。}
#{900}{}{[Malcolm pulls out a hose leading somewhere under the desk. At the end of the hose is a tripple nozzle. You put two ends into your nostrils, the third one into your mouth. Malcolm turns a tap under the desk, a hissing sound follows.]}
{900}{}{[马尔科姆从桌子下面的某处抽出一根软管。在软管的末端是一个三喷嘴。你把两头放在鼻孔里，第三头放在嘴里。马尔科姆在桌子下面打开水龙头，一个嘶嘶的声音随之而来。]}

#{962}{}{Great...}
{962}{}{伟大的……}
#{1000}{}{I'm sorry but I cannot lower the price. It's not simple to fetch the right substances and then breathe God's power into them! We are not talking about any regular stuff, we're talking about the best of my creations, we're talking about "Elevation"!}
{1000}{}{对不起，我不能降价。获取正确的物质，然后将上帝的力量注入其中，这并不简单！我们谈论的不是任何常规的东西，我们谈论的是我最好的创作，我们谈论的是“提升”！}
#{1001}{}{I think I'd like to see what else you've got to offer, instead.}
{1001}{}{我想我想看看你还能提供什么。}
#{1002}{}{I might come back.}
{1002}{}{我可能会回来。}
#{1050}{}{The purchase of God's gifts is a blessing for us both. Come back whenever you want, my child, and we can continue to be blessed.}
{1050}{}{购买上帝的礼物对我们都是一种祝福。你想什么时候回来就什么时候回来，我的孩子，我们可以继续得到祝福。}
#{1051}{}{I'm also interested in the "Elevation".}
{1051}{}{我也对“提升”感兴趣。}
#{1052}{}{Good-bye.}
{1052}{}{再见。}
#{1100}{}{How could it? How can a gift from God be hazardous in any way? Repent, thou of little faith! I myself often elevate and you can see I am healthy! I am more than that, I'm fully blessed, enlightened and thus I can send forth God's gifts to all who believe.}
{1100}{}{怎么可能呢？上帝的恩赐怎么会有危险呢？悔改吧，你这个缺乏信心的人！我自己经常提升，你可以看到我很健康！我不仅如此，我是完全受祝福的，开悟的，因此我可以把上帝的礼物送给所有相信我的人。}
#{1101}{}{Good, here's 500 caps, I wan to try it.}
{1101}{}{很好，这有500瓶盖，我想试试。}
#{1102}{}{But I don't have 500 caps.}
{1102}{}{但我没有500瓶盖。}
#{1103}{}{I think I'd like to see what else you've got to offer, instead.}
{1103}{}{我想我想看看你还能提供什么。}
#{1104}{}{I'm not interested, anyway.}
{1104}{}{反正我也不感兴趣。}
#{1150}{}{[You feel great, as if... As if you were floating. There are no words to describe the experience, but it certainly is amazing, possibly even divine. You seem to hear Malcolm's voice from a great distance.] Yes, your first elevation! You are strong, my son, and I'm sure you have access to town. Do you want to help the needy to elevate as well? To bear God's gifts to those who cannot come for them on their own?}
{1150}{}{[你感觉很棒，好像……好像你在漂浮。没有语言来描述这段经历，但它肯定是惊人的，甚至可能是神圣的。你好像从很远的地方听到马尔科姆的声音]是的，你的第一次提升！你很强壮，我的儿子，我相信你有机会进城。你想帮助穷人也提升吗？把神的恩赐赐给那些不能自己来的人？}
#{1151}{}{Hmm?}
{1151}{}{额-额？}
#{1200}{}{There is a cop who would seek my blessing were it not for the allegedly benevolent police which nevertheless forbids the use of the gifts of our Lord. Because of that, I am not allowed to enter the devil's ground that the town is, but you surely are. Carry the gifts I'll sell you for 1500 caps to this man and he will exchange them for 2000 caps. That way you and your holy quest will be blessed by acquiring the value of "Elevation". You can find the policeman guarding the gate to the sheriff's estate. He wasn't willing to tell more about himself.}
{1200}{}{有一个警察会寻求我的祝福，如果不是所谓的仁慈的警察，但禁止使用我们的上帝的礼物。因此，我不能进入那城的魔鬼之地，但你确实是。把礼物拿给这个人，我以1500个瓶盖的价格卖给你，他将以2000个瓶盖的价格交换。这样，你和你的神圣追求将通过获得“提升”的价值而得到祝福。你可以找到警察守着警长庄园的大门。他不愿意透露更多关于自己的情况。}
#{1201}{}{I will take up this holy quest.}
{1201}{}{我将承担这神圣的任务。}
#{1202}{}{I don't have 1500 caps.}

#{1203}{}{That's too dangerous, I don't want to do it.}
{1203}{}{那太危险了，我不想做。}
#{1250}{}{God bless Senor, because he chooses as his agents the strongest of the flock and does not inhibit their growth. You've come at the right moment for me to send you on a holy quest.}
{1250}{}{愿上帝保佑先生，因为他选择了羊群中最强壮的一个作为他的代理人，并不妨碍他们的成长。你来得正是我送你去神圣之旅的时候。}
#{1251}{}{What do I have to do?}

#{1609}{}{Hoohaa.}
{1609}{}{你好。}
#{1650}{}{The will of our Lord is inscrutable, your holy quest seems to be endangered. By offering our Lord's gifts to him who refuses them, you risk the eye of the Devil himself locking on you and sending forth his minions.
