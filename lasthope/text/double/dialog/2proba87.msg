{100}{}{[Whispering.] Hey stranger... uh... Are they still there...?}
{101}{}{What are you talking about, who are "they"?}
#
{102}{}{[You can barely hear what he's saying.] Oh, sorry, I'm Dan and this is my son Tim. Those rowdies outside...
 *cough*. Yesterday I sent my son to get some supplies for us. Those bastards saw my little boy and started harassing
 him. When I came out to protect him, they beat the shit out of me! *Cough*... Now we can't go out no more, they
 may start again and do something even worse...}
{103}{}{Oh... Those bastards... How can I help?}
{104}{}{I'm sorry to hear that but what can I do? I don't know those people, I might get hurt as well.}
#I will help you...
{105}{}{Oh... thank God! You'll have to find a way to convince them to leave us alone. I don't have any chance against
 them... after what happened I'm not sure they will listen to me, but you could set things right. Please hurry... I'm
 hurt pretty bad over here. I must go to a doctor as soon as possible.}
{106}{}{Don't worry, I'll be back soon.}
#
{107}{}{Damn you, coward! Get out of my house! *Cough*}
{108}{}{Or what...?}
{109}{}{I'm going... for now.}
#
{110}{}{Where are those rowdies? *Cough* Are they gone?}
{111}{}{Uh... yeah. And they will never come back, I think.}
{112}{}{You'll never see them again in your life. Let's go see a doctor now.}
{113}{}{Not yet.}
#done...
{114}{}{Thank you! You already did so much for us... Please take this money. [Hands you $850.] Don't worry
 *cough* about me, I can walk on my own.}
{115}{}{Take care, Dan.}
#i think...
{116}{}{So, are you sure it's safe now?}
{117}{}{Yes, I made a deal with them. They seemed reasonable enough. You can visit the doctor now.}
#
{118}{}{Thank you so much... Please take this money. [Hands you $850.] I'll be on my way to the doctor now, I only
 have to pack some things first.}
{119}{}{Take care, Dan.}
#
{120}{}{Don't bother me!}
{121}{}{Who will take care of my son...}
{122}{}{You are the worst kind...}
{123}{}{...(cough)... }
{124}{}{Leave...}
{125}{}{Let us be...}
#
{126}{}{Thank you...}
{127}{}{I owe you.}
{128}{}{I'll be OK...}
{129}{}{...(cough)...Thanks...}
{130}{}{Good luck stranger.}
