1:For the first time in history, Olympus was left without its Administrator. No one was responsible for coordination of all the departments of the tower.
2:So there was a revolt. The tower was plunged into anarchy. Some of its former residents escaped into the wasteland. Many of them died there.
3:Eventually, the tower's security systems began to fail, and its lower levels became flooded with inhabitants of Radius. Assessing the situation, DEUS activated the total protection protocol.
4:With all its entrances sealed, the Olympus was turned into a tomb with a number of people stuck inside. As years went by, the wastelanders lost interest in the impregnable skyscraper.
