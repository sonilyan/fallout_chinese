{201}{}{路拐错了我要去的地方。我来这里是偶然的。}
### {202}{}{It has been a long time since we had strangers from distant lands. It would be interesting to ask you, but now we have a holiday, as you can see. An important day - after all, my daughter Lucia had the honor to open this performance.}
{202}{}{我们已经很久没有陌生人了。问你会很有趣，但正如你所看到的，现在我们有假期。这是一个重要的日子――毕竟，我的女儿露西娅有幸为这场演出揭幕。}
### {203}{}{And what is this tradition?}
{203}{}{这个传统是什么？}
### {204}{}{Day of all the living. The day when we thank our saints that we are still alive. The coronation will be the end of the holiday. Any resident can be crowned. This allows us to appreciate each other and not forget that we are all one cohesive team in the middle of the desert.}
{204}{}{所有活着的人的日子。当我们感谢我们的圣人的那一天，我们还活着。加冕典礼将是假期的结束。任何居民都可以加冕。这让我们能够相互欣赏，不要忘记我们都是一支团结在沙漠中的团队。}

{1221}{}{你好，亲爱的。}
### {222}{}{Adios, Enrique.}
{222}{}{再见，恩里克。}

### {230}{}{Did you know that the ceremonial crown is missing?}
{230}{}{你知道仪式王冠不见了吗？}
### {231}{}{Here is a strange case! There has never been such a thing. But she couldn't have disappeared by herself, right? I can't even imagine how this could happen. There were a lot of different people around the table, especially kids.}
{231}{}{这是一个奇怪的案例！从来没有这样的事情。但她不可能自己消失，对吧？我甚至无法想象这是怎么发生的。桌子周围有很多不同的人，尤其是孩子们。}
### {232}{}{I see.}
{232}{}{我明白了。}
### {233}{}{And you speak English well.}
{233}{}{而且你英语说得很好。}
### {234}{}{We traveled a lot in Sonora. Therefore, some of us understand the Northern language a little.}
{234}{}{我们经常在索诺拉旅行。因此，我们中的一些人对北方语言有一点了解。}
### {235}{}{By the way, you have an unusually large number of children.}

{236}{}{嗯，是的。应该不是这样吗？孩子是我们的幸福和未来。尽管他们中的许多人活不到老年。}
### {237}{}{What about Ilario? How old is he?}
{237}{}{伊拉里奥呢？他多大了？}
### {238}{}{He is our permanent headman. No wonder it is so carefully guarded. Although the old man is getting dirtier with age, it's with his help that we are still alive.}
{238}{}{他是我们永久的校长。难怪它被如此小心地保护着。尽管老人随着年龄的增长越来越脏，但正是在他的帮助下，我们才还活着。}

{239}{}{你知道索诺拉有哪些有趣的地方？}
### {240}{}{Really? Can you show me some interesting places?}
{240}{}{真正地你能给我看一些有趣的地方吗？}
### {241}{}{The nearest city to us is Casa Nueva. Further to the east are the ruins of Puerto Penasco, and far to the south is the military fort in Hermosillo. We have been living in this place for ten years, so I do not know how things are there.}
{241}{}{离我们最近的城市是努瓦之家。再往东是佩纳斯科港的废墟，再往南是赫莫西洛的军事堡垒。我们已经在这个地方住了十年了，所以我不知道那里的情况如何。}
### {242}{}{I don't know what to say, Enrique. I'm just in shock.}
{242}{}{我不知道该说什么，恩里克。我只是很震惊。}

### {250}{}{Hey, amigo! You already know our secret, right? What do you think about it?}

{254}{}{我猜你会这么说。我想我自己――我们是什么时候堕落到把灵魂出卖给魔鬼的？但这种情况以前从未发生过。我记得没有暗黑破坏神的日子。明亮美丽的日子。。。}
### {255}{}{Well, now you have a chance to start over.}
{255}{}{好吧，现在你有机会重新开始了。}
### {256}{}{So he's dead after all, right? What a relief! But Ilario won't let it go. He will resist the changes and lie as if El Diablo did not die. For fifteen years, he was too used to power. I want to get this freeloader out of town. Help me. Not everyone here is as opposed to him as I am.}
{256}{}{所以他毕竟死了，对吧？真是松了一口气！但伊拉里奥不会放过它。他会抵制这些变化并撒谎，就好像暗黑破坏神没有死一样。十五年来，他太习惯权力了。我想把这个白吃白喝的人带出城。帮帮我。这里不是每个人都像我一样反对他。}
### {257}{}{With pleasure. It'll be fun to watch him roll down the street. Go to church, I'll follow you.}
{257}{}{很高兴。看着他在街上打滚会很有趣。去教堂吧，我跟你去。}
### {258}{}{Let me talk to him. I'll try to convince him.}
{258}{}{让我和他谈谈。我会试着说服他。}
### {259}{}{My mission ended with the death of the monster. Then solve your problems yourself.}
{259}{}{我的任务以怪物的死亡而结束。然后自己解决你的问题。}

{263}{}{让我和他谈谈。}

### {265}{}{Ilario escaped. He's not coming back.}
{265}{}{伊拉里奥逃走了。他不会回来了。}
### {266}{}{Yes! How wonderful it became without him. I can already imagine how Santa Ana will be transformed without this old man and without the monster. No one else needs to be sacrificed. There is no more need to lie and pretend that nothing is happening. Thank you, friend. Here, take my gun as a token of appreciation. Now you are our guardian angel.}
{266}{}{对没有他，一切变得多么美妙。我已经可以想象，如果没有这个老人和怪物，圣安娜将如何改变。没有其他人需要被牺牲。没有必要再撒谎，假装什么都没发生。谢谢你，朋友。给，拿着我的枪表示感谢。现在你是我们的守护天使。}
### {267}{}{It's always nice to help people. Goodbye, Enrique.}
{267}{}{帮助别人总是很好的。再见，恩里克。}
### {268}{}{Is there anything else I can do to help in the end?}
{268}{}{最后我还能做些什么吗？}
### {269}{}{You know, I'm the village head now. And I want to establish trade with the neighboring town of Casa Nueva. We have nothing much to offer in return, but we will try to negotiate. Can you give them an offer? Let them send a caravan here for negotiations.}
{269}{}{你知道，我现在是村长了。我想和邻近的卡萨纽瓦镇建立贸易关系。我们没有什么可以提供的回报，但我们会努力谈判。你能给他们一个报价吗？让他们派一个大篷车来谈判吧。}
### {270}{}{Okay, I'll do it.}
{270}{}{好吧，我来做。}
### {271}{}{I'll hardly ever be there. But I will keep in mind.}
{271}{}{我几乎不会去那里。但我会记住的。}
### {272}{}{Aren't there too many victims? Maybe not?}
{272}{}{受害者不是太多了吗？也许不是？}
### {273}{}{If he is not stopped now, then in the future we will continue to make sacrifices to his vanity. And the further, the more difficult it will be to fix the situation.}
{273}{}{如果他现在不被阻止，那么在未来我们将继续为他的虚荣心做出牺牲。而且越是深入，就越难以解决这种局面。}
### {274}{}{Then it's not worth wasting time. Let's go to church!}
{274}{}{那就不值得浪费时间了。让我们去教堂吧！}
### {275}{}{In front of you is an ancient church in which the Devil was not worshipped at all. Are you ready to take another sin on yourself in this holy place?}
{275}{}{你面前是一座古老的教堂，里面根本没有魔鬼的崇拜。你准备好在这个圣地再犯一次罪了吗？}
### {276}{}{Your truth. But if Ilario goes back to his old ways, it will be the fault of all of us.}
{276}{}{你的真相。但如果伊拉里奥回到过去，那将是我们所有人的错。}
### {277}{}{It's good that you've come to your senses. Let's leave the old man alone.}
{277}{}{你恢复了理智，这很好。让我们别管那个老人。}
### {278}{}{What are you? I'm just saying that it's better to sin once than to suffer massive transgressions. Let's go to church and put an end to this!}
{278}{}{你是什么？我只是说，犯一次罪总比遭受巨大的违法行为好。让我们去教堂结束这一切吧！}
### {279}{}{Don't be in a hurry to give up. I just want to convince Ilario without using brute force. Wait here.}
{279}{}{不要急于放弃。我只是想在不使用暴力的情况下说服伊拉里奥。在这里等候。}
### {280}{}{And yet you were right-it was necessary to get rid of Ilario. Which I did.}
{280}{}{然而你是对的，有必要除掉伊拉里奥。我做到了。}
### {1280}{}{And yet you were right-it was necessary to get rid of Ilario. Which I did.}
{1280}{}{然而你是对的，有必要除掉伊拉里奥。我做到了。}
### {281}{}{What are you? I'm just saying that it's better to sin once than to suffer massive transgressions. Let's put an end to this here and now!}
{281}{}{你是什么？我只是说，犯一次罪总比遭受巨大的违法行为好。让我们现在就结束这一切！}
### {282}{}{Unfortunately, Casa Nueva is going through hard times right now. You should forget about trading with this city.}
{282}{}{不幸的是，Casa Nueva现在正经历艰难时期。你应该忘记和这个城市交易。}
### {283}{}{Sad news. It's okay, we'll survive without them somehow. Thanks for the warning.}

### {1283}{}{Sad news. It's okay, we'll survive without them somehow. Thanks for the warning.}
{1283}{}{不幸的消息。没关系，我们会在没有他们的情况下生存。谢谢你的警告。}
### {284}{}{Please.}
{284}{}{请}
### {285}{}{Hola, amigo. Recently, a caravan from Casa Nueva came to us. Thank you for your help.}
{285}{}{你好，朋友。最近，一辆来自努瓦之家的大篷车来找我们。谢谢你的帮助。}
### {286}{}{Here's the thing... Ilario ALSO passed away. Don't ask how it happened.}
{286}{}{事情是这样的。。。伊拉里奥也去世了。不要问它是怎么发生的。}
### {287}{}{Ilario fled the village when he realized that his power had come to an end. I doubt he'll come back.}
{287}{}{伊拉里奥意识到自己的权力已经结束后逃离了村庄。我怀疑他会回来。}

### {290}{}{How did you even get to such a life?}
{290}{}{你是怎么过上这样的生活的？}
### {291}{}{It's a long story. It started more than fifteen years ago.}
{291}{}{说来话长。它始于十五年前。}
### {292}{}{I don't even want to listen to this story. Let's change the subject?}
{292}{}{我甚至不想听这个故事。我们换个话题吧？}
### {293}{}{Tell me more.}
{293}{}{告诉我更多。}
### {294}{}{We were a nomadic people and wandered through the Sonoran desert in search of suitable places to live. One day we were accosted by this monster. He chased our caravan and periodically dragged away one person or cattle. We couldn't fight him off or run away from him - he's too strong and too fast.}
{294}{}{我们是游牧民族，在索诺兰沙漠中游荡，寻找合适的住处。有一天，我们被这个怪物搭讪。他追着我们的商队，不时地拖走一个人或一头牛。我们无法击退他，也无法逃离他――他太强壮、太快了。}
### {295}{}{Go on.}
{295}{}{继续}
### {296}{}{It's too scary! I'd rather cover my ears and go somewhere far away.}
{296}{}{太可怕了！我宁愿捂住耳朵，到很远的地方去。}
### {297}{}{Then Ilario came up with the idea of sacrificing animals to avoid human casualties. But the cattle soon ran out. And then we began to give away the elderly and the sick. Over time, they also ended. Fortunately, El Diablo had had enough by this point and began to demand fewer and fewer victims. So the balance was found.}
{297}{}{后来伊拉里奥想出了牺牲动物以避免人类伤亡的主意。但是牛很快就跑完了。然后我们开始送老人和病人。随着时间的推移，它们也结束了。幸运的是，暗黑破坏神已经受够了，开始要求越来越少的受害者。于是找到了平衡。}
### {298}{}{That's it.}
{298}{}{就是这样。}
### {299}{}{In addition, El Diablo attacked wild animals and bandits who threatened us. In fact, we became his flock, he grazed us and ate us during the famine.}
{299}{}{此外，暗黑破坏神还袭击了威胁我们的野兽和土匪。事实上，我们成了他的羊群，他在饥荒期间放牧并吃掉了我们。}
### {300}{}{But you continued to make sacrifices to him?}
{300}{}{但你继续为他做出牺牲？}
### {301}{}{Once every few months, we gave him a sacrifice that was specially raised for these purposes. And so that no one would be discouraged, Ilario made a ceremony out of it and even began to preach the idea of divine purification. So we lived hand in hand with the real devil. Until you showed up, gringo.}
{301}{}{每隔几个月，我们就给他一次专门为这些目的筹集的祭品。为了不让任何人气馁，伊拉里奥为此举行了一个仪式，甚至开始宣扬神圣净化的理念。所以我们和真正的魔鬼携手生活。直到你出现，外国佬。}
### {302}{}{I hope you will be able to return to normal life. And I have to go on the road.}
{302}{}{我希望你能恢复正常的生活。我必须上路。}
### {303}{}{Shame on you. We always stuck to each other at the Villa. And by the way, after this story, I wanted to return to my native land. Goodbye.}
{303}{}{你真可耻。我们在别墅里总是互相支持。顺便说一句，在这个故事之后，我想回到我的祖国。再见}
