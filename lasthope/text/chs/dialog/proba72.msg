{100}{}{Not now, beat it.}
{101}{}{Take a hike.}
{102}{}{[He looks at you for a moment, his face expression doesn't change. Like he knows you're here for a reason.]
 Who are you? Speak up and you may get to live a little longer.}
#
{103}{}{What is this place?}
{104}{}{Are you in charge here?}
{105}{}{Sorry, wrong room.}
#
{106}{}{[Pointing to the floor.] This place? Why the hell do you want to know?}
{107}{}{Maybe so. Who's asking?}
#1
{108}{}{[Raise your voice.] You are smuggling weapons, and I'm here to confiscate them.}
#
{109}{}{Let me tell you something. [Whispers.] Just between you and me. [Pulls out a gun.] You're going to suffer,
 just like my men who died during that operation!}
#
{110}{}{What operation? I can't hear you... Can you repeat that a bit louder?!}
#2
{111}{}{The people of this town don't need more weapons, they need capable men.}
#
{112}{}{[Throws you an angry look.] Who said anything about any weapons? What the fuck are you talking about?}
#a
{113}{}{Hm... smuggled weapons, I guess, in here.}
{114}{}{Those grenades your men smuggled in...}
#a1
{115}{}{Smuggled weapons? Who told you that?}
#
{116}{}{One of the locals.}
#
{117}{}{Does that person have a name?}
#
{118}{}{He lives, uh... Over there. [You point in a random direction.]}
#
{119}{}{Yeah sure, there's a bar... And it's possible some barfly whispered you the buzz. Are you sure you didn't drink
 a bit more than you can handle? Because I can smell it on you...}
#
{120}{}{(You can smell your own body, but other than that...) Odd you can tell over your own foul stench of crap!}
#
{121}{}{All right, hold him guys... this is going to be fun. [You try to struggle but are overpowered. James takes a
 bottle of booze and spills it over you, causing you to choke on the liquid and gasp desperately for air. The last second
 before your senses leave you they let go and you take a deep breath.] Now YOU smell like crap! [And they proceed to
 throw you outside.]}
#a2
{122}{}{Smuggled grenades? Where would you get such a crazy idea?}
#
{123}{}{I saw you doing it.}
{124}{}{I was told by someone who saw it.}
#3
{125}{}{That guy Derek told me. [You point to the building across the front door.]}
#
{126}{}{Ah... Derek told you. Why is he suddenly interested in our plans?}
#
{127}{}{He is worried about the town's safety. He said too many people have died because of the increasing number
 of weapons around. He's asking if you are willing to let the explosives go.}
{128}{}{He personally saw you smuggling those weapons. And he wants them confiscated.}
#
{129}{}{Well... In that case... Look, those weapons cost me a lot. I'll hand over the weapons if he can refund me, about
 $3000.}
#
{130}{}{I'll come back with the money.}
{131}{}{Derek already gave me some money. Here's your $3000. So where are those weapons?}
#
{132}{}{Here's the key for the store-room. It's the guarded door just left from the front door. And tell Derek that with
 this I'm repaying that favor I owed him, that our debts are even. Got it?}
#
{133}{}{Alright, I'll let him know.}
#
{134}{}{[A grim smile forms on his face.] Derek saw me? So I guess, the whole town is buzzing by now. Which
 means there's no way we can do it again... Well, one thing comes to mind. [Pulls out a gun.] I suggest you start
 running!}
{135}{}{Yeah... [Run to the front door.]}
#odgovor na Who's in charge here?
{136}{}{If you must know... Nobody is in charge here. We are running this show all by ourselves. Why do you want to know?}
#
{137}{}{There are some public safety matters I wanted to talk about.}
#
{138}{}{Why don't you say who you are...? [Mumbling: (Just some smartass asking questions...)] Get the fuck out of
 here!}
#
{139}{}{You again. Did you bring money?}
#
{140}{}{Yes, here it is. [Give him $3000.]}
{141}{}{Not yet.}
#
{142}{}{That's the biggest fuckin' lie I've ever heard. You'd better turn around and walk outta here. Any more
 of your nonsense and you'll be as dead as those raiders. Understood!?}
#
{143}{}{You're a real bastard!}
{144}{}{I'm going.}
#
{145}{}{If you have some business with me, talk! Otherwise, get lost!}
{146}{}{Sorry, my mistake.}
#
{147}{}{We need to think of something better.}
{148}{}{Those damn thieves must pay.}
{149}{}{Raiders, heh... They are nothing.}
{150}{}{For the right cause. To the end.}
{151}{}{...any suggestions?}
{152}{}{Yep, we had some tough moments.}
{153}{}{We sure beat those tribals.}
#
{154}{}{[Throws an angry look at you.] You again! What the hell do you want now?}
#after 112
{155}{}{You tried to cover up that operation of your... well, how would you call it, legitimate business, but it didn't
 work.}
#after 126
{156}{}{So you admit there are "plans", involving certain weapons?}
#
{157}{}{I have a better idea, drop dead asshole!}
#after 119
{158}{}{(You know you don't have a drinking habit but decide to keep the situation under control.) Hm... I guess
 you're right, I'll come back when I'm sober.}
{159}{}{[Exit.]}
#
{160}{}{[Smiles.] Well, if it ain't my drinking buddy. What...? Did you say you want another one? Or did you come
 back to lick up the spillage? Haha, get lost scum!}
{161}{}{[Leave.]}
#reply in node002, after 137
{162}{}{What public safety matters?}
#
{163}{}{Nothing, nevermind.}
