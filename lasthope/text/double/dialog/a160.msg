{103}{}{I hope you are not one of those bandits... Wait, I am! ::Laughs::}
{104}{}{Do you know how to use a gun?}
{105}{}{I think I saw you somewhere...}
{106}{}{Hey, don't mess with me!}
{107}{}{Go bother someone else!}
{108}{}{Hey, nice tattoo you got there.}
{109}{}{I've seen that mark before, you sure aren't from around here.}

{110}{}{Well, I've heard about you. They are planning your funeral!}
{111}{}{This is no place for you, shithead!}
{112}{}{What? Did you just say something to me...!?}
{113}{}{What are you looking at!?}
{114}{}{This is the wrong place for you, pal!}
{115}{}{Are you stupid or something, to show your face here!?}
{116}{}{Watch your back, some fire gecko might bite your ass!}
