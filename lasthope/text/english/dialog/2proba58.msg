{100}{}{Work is good, but hard.}
{101}{}{Just a breather, and back to work.}
{102}{}{Good day stranger.}
{103}{}{Nothing unusual today.}
{104}{}{I'll need to send that letter, somehow...}
{105}{}{It was easier when Steve was here, but no time, just no time...}
{106}{}{I miss my wife and kid.}
{107}{}{Something's iffy, can't put my finger on it.}
{108}{}{I'm not sure how Mr. Basil runs his business.}
#
{109}{}{Hey stranger I've heard about Basil's doings, and I'm glad you took care of it, I never liked the looks of him. I
 would like you to do something for me. I'm in despair... You see, I have a son and wife... They live in Miners Town
 and I wanted to write a letter, to let them know that I'm alright. At first I thought that I would be able to go visit
 them, but I'm too busy working and making a living here, so I won't be able to take even a short break for the trip.
 Could you possibly take this letter and deliver it to my wife?}
{110}{}{Yes, I can do that. So, you’re hard at work here?}
{111}{}{I'll think about it.}
#yes I could...
{112}{}{[Sighs.] Huh... Tell me about it. My son Steve used to be here with me for some time, but I got so damn busy
 that I couldn't watch over him. I couldn't watch over my own son! I had a talk with my wife and we decided that the
 best thing for Steve is that he lives with his mother in Miners. It's actually a good solution... Anyway, when do you
 think you'll be ready to deliver the letter?}
{113}{}{I think I'm ready to go now.}
{114}{}{I'll be back when I'm ready.}
#Go now...
{115}{}{Alright... Give me a minute to get the letter.}
{116}{}{OK, I'm waiting.}
#waiting...
{117}{}{OK, here. [Gives you the letter.] You just hand it over to my wife and I'll be very grateful. Take care...
 [Turns around.] Back to work then.}
{118}{}{Goodbye.}
#
{119}{}{Hello again, wanna deliver that letter to my wife?}
{120}{}{Yes, tell me about it.}
{121}{}{Not yet.}
#
{122}{}{Ready to take this letter to my wife?}
