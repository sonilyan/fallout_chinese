{100}{}{Greetings traveler. How may I be of service?}
{101}{}{Who are you?}
{102}{}{What is this place?}
{103}{}{I don't need anything right now.}
#who are you...
{104}{}{Call me Robert. I'm keeping this sacred place of knowledge out of harm's way. In this city we are better
 known as the FORM. Within our organization we study ancient cultures, documents and their view of the world.}
{105}{}{What is the FORM exactly?}
#
{106}{}{The FORM, "Followers Of the Reasonable Mind", is collecting and studying old items, written documents...
 anything that could teach us about previous civilizations and their ways of life. By knowing our past we can prepare
 for the future.}
{107}{}{Prepare, how?}
{108}{}{Did you find any items so far?}
{109}{}{Interesting, let me ask you something else.}
#prepare...
{110}{}{History tends to repeat itself, like a time loop on a large scale. Written records date back more than five
 thousand and two hundred years ago... plenty of data to be analyzed. Let me give you an example from "recent"
 history [he smiles.] The first Great War in the beginning of the 20th century taught people how to implement ancient
 war tactics into "modern" warfare, forcing them to build more sophisticated and devastating weapons. Every following
 war brought more casualties and destruction...}
{111}{}{True, go on...}
#
{112}{}{..."Having a bigger weapon than your enemies" was their motto. Waging their wars over the centuries left our
 world in a terrible state. Pollution caused all kinds of sudden weather changes, irradiated the wasteland. One of our
 projects is to built an "environmental" armor as we call it. It will use multi functional materials designed to withstand
 both weather effects and high energy particles penetration.}
{113}{}{So, how does it work?}
#
{114}{}{The armor had been built from several layers of synthetic fibers which gives it greater resistance to fire,
 plasma and radiation. But, against weapon projectiles, it acts as a shock absorber. Shortly, it will pass on some of the
 projectile's kinetic energy to your body, so you'll definitively feel that [chuckles]. This is just a prototype though.
 We still have to solve its weight issue because we used composite metal alloy for high energy particles protection.
 Overall, it's reliable but offers minimal protection.}
{115}{}{Well, I still want to try it, could I have one?}
{116}{}{Thanks for the info, another question please.}
{117}{}{Good luck with that armor. I'll be going then.}
#have one...
{118}{}{Since this is a prototype, it's the only working model we have and therefore it is unique. Although this
 technology hasn't been fully tested in the field, the costs for building materials and handiwork come at a price. About
 $2200, interested?}
{119}{}{No I don't have the money right now.}
{120}{}{OK, I got the money right here.}
#Don't have the money...
{121}{}{No problem, I'll be here. So when you decide to buy it, come back and I'll be happy to give you this fine piece
 of technology.}
{122}{}{Sure thing.}
{123}{}{Why don't you just hand over that armor and I will let you live!}
#Let live...
{124}{}{I hope you won't die too quick, ‘cause this is gonna hurt you a lot! And I get a chance to test my new armor.}
{125}{}{Just bring it on.}
#here's the money...
{126}{}{All right, all the money is here, you can have the armor now. Here you go. [Gives you the armor.] I hope you
 will enjoy wearing it as I did making it.}
{127}{}{I hope so. [Leave.]}
#find any items so far...
{128}{}{We found many, kept in the underground vaults. Some were buried on the surface, but surprisingly well
 preserved. Our estimation is that one third of the valuable items were destroyed during the course of time. In a
 sense, each of those items presented a piece of history... which is now lost for ever. But putting together the pieces that
 we have, helped pretty much so far to figure how technology and the use of materials developed over the centuries.}
{129}{}{Why do you study materials?}
{130}{}{Thanks for the info, another question please.}
#study materials...
{131}{}{With diverse materials at our disposal we can study advantages and deficiencies of each and every one of
 them. Which will lead to the implementation of that technology into armor production, transportation and more...}
{132}{}{So you got big plans for the future?}
#
{133}{}{Think of it as a necessity or precautionary measure. As for the future... there's none if tomorrow only
 holds more conflicts and destruction. Our own existence might be in jeopardy if we continue this road towards self
 destruction. So we're trying here to make people start thinking again, for the better of us all.}
{134}{}{You're right, another question please.}
#this place...
{135}{}{This is something like a history classroom. You can see all books and writings that we found from which we
 make transcripts, each one was used at some point during our research. Search for knowledge still goes on so we
 collect all kinds of scientific documents that could be of use. Also, we have a research lab below this level. It's just for
 our staff though.}
{136}{}{Why do you collect old items?}
#Again...
{137}{}{Of course, what's on your mind?}
#
{138}{}{Greetings traveler, how can I help you this time?}
{139}{}{About that armor...}
#armor...
{140}{}{Are you interested in buying this prototype?}
{141}{}{Sure, here's the money.}
{142}{}{I don't have the money right now.}
#
{143}{}{I guarantee you won't regret it. We used all flexible materials, no mechanical parts, so you don't have to polish
 it or change batteries... If you have any problems with it, just bring it back and we'll see what we can do.}
{144}{}{OK, so long.}
#after 113...
{145}{}{Any other projects you are working on?}
#answer to line 145...
{146}{}{Well, creating the environmental armor is our priority, however, we do have other projects. For example, I
 just started working on this other thing. I wanted to do something about the radioactive particles in the groundwater...}
{147}{}{Yes, I'm listening...}
#
{148}{}{...and came up with an idea to speed up the decay process of those radioactive particles by submitting them to
 energy particles... of a different kind, [smiles.] It's still work in progress. So I don't want to get into details right
 now, not before we conduct more research. I thought it would be easy, but several tests proved me wrong.
 Nevertheless, I've just scratched the surface of a wide range of possibilities.}
{149}{}{I see. I got a question I wanted to ask you.}
