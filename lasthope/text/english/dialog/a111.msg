{100}{}{Go ahead, take a look... Just let me know when you find something for you. And don't wander around for too
 long, my back hurts and I have some work to do later.}
{101}{}{Sure.}
{102}{}{Actually, I don't want to buy anything right now.}
#
{103}{}{So, did you find anything interesting?}
{104}{}{I need some time to think. I want to take another look.}
{105}{}{Flier Caravan...}
{106}{}{Armored Truck...}
{107}{}{Chrysalis Car...}
{108}{}{Chrysalis Truck...}
{109}{}{Nothing right now, maybe later.}
#flier...
{110}{}{It's fast, reliable, doesn't have much space for your stuff but you can escape from any trouble you encounter
 on the road. It uses a modified micro fusion controller so it can drain some extra power from the batteries. The car is
 yours for $2500.}
{111}{}{Sounds good, here's the money.}
{112}{}{I don't want to buy it right now, let me ask you something.}
#armour...
{113}{}{It's a beast with large cargo space, almost like a small house. With this truck, safety is guaranteed, one
 centimeter thick steel. It's big and massive but slower than other vehicles. You can even mount some weapons on it,
 like I said, lots of space for everything. It's yours for $4000.}
{114}{}{Alright, here's $4000.}
{115}{}{Let me think. Can I ask you something first.}
#chrysalis car...
{116}{}{That's my favorite car. It has both speed and room. You can also attach a trailer to it. I have modified it to
 be a more reliable off-road vehicle. The adjusted micro fusion controller consumes more power than usual but it
 doesn't burn out like previous versions. This one of a kind Chrysalis is yours for $3000.}
{117}{}{It's a deal, here's the money.}
{118}{}{Sounds good, let me ask you something first.}
#chrysalis truck...
{119}{}{It's actually a Chrysalis car, modified to gain more room and attach some firepower on it. Though, you can
 always add more. Back and front tires are full profile rubber, no more shooting at the tires. [Smiles.] The driver has a
 good protection against small arms and rifles. The vehicle's total cost is $3500.}
{120}{}{I'll buy it. Here's $3500.}
{121}{}{I want to check the other cars before I buy something. One question if I may?}
#ask something...
{122}{}{Fine, what you want?}
{123}{}{I was wondering about that car...}
{124}{}{Do you sell car parts?}
{125}{}{Thanks for your time, I have to go now.}
#car parts...
{126}{}{I have a lot of parts here, but I use all of them for other vehicles and therefore they are not for sale. If
 you're looking for micro fusion batteries, they can be found in stores, here in town.}
{127}{}{One more question, please?}
{128}{}{Thanks, I'll be going then.}
#car sold...
{129}{}{[Counting the money.] Alright, it's all here. Your vehicle has been parked near the north exit. If you have any
 problems with it, you know where to find me. Old Rob has some junk to repair now... And don't forget your keys.
 [Jingles the keys in front of you.]}
{130}{}{Sure, see you Rob.}
