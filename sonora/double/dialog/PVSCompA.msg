### {241}{}{...Conclusion 1. As expected, the cult of Fire created on the model of the Chad Cathedral showed high results. He captured almost all spheres of life in the city and firmly established himself in his position. The population of Phoenix either remains loyal to the fire worshippers, or is afraid of them. Thus, we can flexibly change the local society at our discretion by the Followers of Fire.
