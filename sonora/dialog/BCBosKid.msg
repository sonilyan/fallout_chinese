### {100}{}{Here is Chatto.}
{100}{}{这是查特。}
### {101}{}{You see a young man with a restless look.}
{101}{}{你看到一个年轻人神情不安。}
### {102}{}{Wow, is this one of those things they invent in the City? Amazing!}
{102}{}{哇，这是他们在伦敦金融城发明的东西吗？太神了}
### {103}{}{The old man is completely out of his mind!}
{103}{}{老人完全疯了！}
### {104}{}{I will change. I promise, I will protect my tribe from outsiders from Phoenix until the end.}
{104}{}{我会改变的。我保证，我会保护我的部落不受凤凰城外来者的伤害，直到最后。}

### {200}{}{Ugh, finally Mangas left me alone. It probably looks wild to you at all. Don't think we're all like that. This old man just lost his mind.}
{200}{}{啊，最后曼加斯让我一个人呆着。在你看来，这可能很疯狂。不要以为我们都是那样。这个老人刚刚失去了理智。}
### {201}{}{Who are you?}
{201}{}{你是谁？}
### {202}{}{My name is Chatto. I am a warrior of my tribe.}
{202}{}{我的名字叫查特。我是我部落的战士。}
### {203}{}{Hi, Chatto. Why is that old man mad at you?}
{203}{}{嗨，查特。为什么那个老人生你的气？}
### {204}{}{Mangas decided that he, as a shaman, could tell everyone what was right and what was wrong. And why can't I decide for myself? I am also a future leader!}
{204}{}{曼加斯决定，作为一名萨满，他可以告诉每个人什么是对的，什么是错的。为什么我不能自己决定呢？我也是未来的领导者！}
### {205}{}{The future? And who is the real one?}
{205}{}{未来？谁才是真正的那个？}
### {206}{}{My father, High Chief Geronimo. Surely you've heard of him, he's a legend. It was he who rallied the tribe and founded the San Brahmin. But other leaders sometimes envy that they did not take his place.}
{206}{}{我的父亲，高级长官杰罗尼莫。你肯定听说过他，他是个传奇。正是他召集了部落并建立了圣婆罗门。但其他领导人有时会嫉妒他们没有取代他的位置。}
### {1206}{}{My father, High Chief Geronimo. Surely you've heard of him, he's a legend. It was he who rallied the tribe and founded the San Brahmin. But other leaders sometimes envy that they did not take his place.}
{1206}{}{我的父亲，高级长官杰罗尼莫。你肯定听说过他，他是个传奇。正是他召集了部落并建立了圣婆罗门。但其他领导人有时会嫉妒他们没有取代他的位置。}
### {207}{}{And what will you do when you become the head of the tribe?}
{207}{}{当你成为部落首领后，你会做什么？}
### {208}{}{To hell with old traditions and this endless war! We must make peace with Phoenix-for our safety and for our future. Such an alliance would give us many opportunities. Look at the weapons of strangers, at new objects of labor, radio communication alone is worth something...}
{208}{}{让古老的传统和这场无休止的战争见鬼去吧！为了我们的安全和我们的未来，我们必须与凤凰城和平相处。这样的联盟会给我们很多机会。看看陌生人的武器，看看新的劳动对象，光是无线电通信就有价值。。。}
### {209}{}{You're developing a thought...}
{209}{}{你正在形成一种想法。。。}
### {210}{}{And what do the rangers give us? They only protect from bandits and dangerous animals. Many young people support me. We are tired of old people and their instructions. They are leading us to war. It's time for the tribe to change.}
{210}{}{护林员给我们什么？他们只保护自己不受土匪和危险动物的伤害。很多年轻人支持我。我们厌倦了老人和他们的指示。他们正在把我们引向战争。是时候让部落改变了。}
### {211}{}{Big ambitions, man. I hope you understand what you're doing. See you later.}
{211}{}{雄心勃勃，伙计。我希望你明白自己在做什么。回头见。}

### {220}{}{Hello, wanderer. Don't the locals offend you? You tell me if someone doesn't like your presence.}
{220}{}{你好，流浪者。当地人不会冒犯你吗？如果有人不喜欢你的出现，你就告诉我。}
### {1220}{}{Hello, wanderer. Don't the locals offend you? You tell me if someone doesn't like your presence.}
{1220}{}{你好，流浪者。当地人不会冒犯你吗？如果有人不喜欢你的出现，你就告诉我。}
### {221}{}{Hello, wanderer.}
{221}{}{你好，流浪者。}
### {1221}{}{Hello, wanderer.}
{1221}{}{你好，流浪者。}
### {222}{}{Everything is fine. I just want to say hello. See you later.}
{222}{}{一切都很好。我只想打个招呼。回头见。}
### {223}{}{And you will do the right thing. Bye.}
{223}{}{你会做正确的事情。再见}
### {224}{}{In my opinion, it's too soft, but it will do.}
{224}{}{在我看来，它太软了，但它会的。}
### {225}{}{The rebels captured the cathedral in Phoenix. Aaron is killed. Nothing is stopping the Rangers now.}
{225}{}{叛军占领了凤凰城的大教堂。亚伦被杀了。现在没有什么能阻止游骑兵队。}

### {230}{}{Chatto, don't you think it's time to take the tribe into your own hands?}
{230}{}{查特，你不认为是时候把部落掌握在自己手中了吗？}
### {231}{}{I've been thinking about it for a long time. Old people don't give me the right to vote. They believe that young people should fight and follow the instructions of their elders.}
{231}{}{我想了很久了。老年人不给我投票权。他们认为年轻人应该战斗并听从长辈的指示。}
### {232}{}{But you don't agree with them, right?}
{232}{}{但你不同意他们的观点，对吧？}
### {233}{}{They don't understand! Life in Phoenix has not been as sick and feeble as it used to be for a long time. We have lost our superiority. Now the townspeople have acquired powerful weapons and technologies.}
{233}{}{他们不明白！在很长一段时间里，凤凰城的生活不再像过去那样病态和虚弱。我们已经失去了优势。现在，镇上的人们已经获得了强大的武器和技术。}
### {234}{}{At this rate, the Phoenix will sweep away the tribe.}
{234}{}{按照这个速度，凤凰会横扫部落。}
### {235}{}{Precisely! The only thing that will allow us to survive is to establish contact with Phoenix in order to outwit its inhabitants. We could also acquire weapons and these technologies.}
{235}{}{精确地唯一能让我们生存下来的就是与凤凰城建立联系，以智取其居民。我们还可以获得武器和这些技术。}
### {236}{}{Exactly. So what are you waiting for?}
{236}{}{确切地你还在等什么？}
### {237}{}{Old people don't want to change the foundations. They are used to the idea that technology is evil, and they need to live only according to the precepts of nature.}
{237}{}{老年人不想改变基础。他们习惯了技术是邪恶的，他们只需要按照自然的戒律生活。}
### {238}{}{Ah, I see. Well, then I have nothing to say. Later.}
{238}{}{啊，我明白了。那我就无话可说了。后来}
### {239}{}{You have to talk some sense into them, Chatto.}
{239}{}{你必须对他们讲一些道理，查特。}
### {240}{}{What can I do? The old people don't give me the right to vote while my father is alive.}
{240}{}{我能做什么？我父亲在世时，老人们不给我投票权。}
### {241}{}{Well, you have few opportunities left. Good luck.}
{241}{}{你的机会不多了。祝你好运}
### {242}{}{When you get the power, it will be too late. Eliminate your padre, Chatto.}
{242}{}{当你获得力量时，一切都为时已晚。消除你的牧师，查特。}
### {243}{}{What? Kill my father? Shut up! I won't do it.}
{243}{}{什么杀了我父亲？闭嘴！我不会做的。}
### {244}{}{Sorry. Forget what you heard.}
{244}{}{很抱歉忘记你听到的。}
### {245}{}{Okay. I'll do it. Someone has to show you the power of the spirit.}
{245}{}{可以我会做的。必须有人向你展示精神的力量。}
### {246}{}{Wait... You're not just going to break into the sanctuary, are you? No, after that I definitely won't get on the throne.}
{246}{}{等待你不会只是想闯入避难所吧？不，在那之后我绝对不会登上王位。}
### {247}{}{Any better suggestions? What about the poison?}
{247}{}{有什么更好的建议吗？毒药呢？}
### {248}{}{Scorpion venom won't work. The whole tribe teaches itself to this poison from an early age. But pre-war drugs usually led to sad consequences when someone decided to be treated with them. Therefore, the tribe abandoned the old medicine a long time ago.}
{248}{}{蝎子的毒液不会起作用。整个部落从小就开始学习这种毒药。但是，当有人决定服用战前药物时，通常会导致可悲的后果。因此，部落很久以前就放弃了古老的医药。}
### {249}{}{I think I can find old chemicals in Phoenix. Bye, Chatto.}
{249}{}{我想我可以在凤凰城找到旧化学品。再见，查特。}
### {250}{}{You risk missing your chance. Your padre has to give in right now. Come on, do it, Chatto.}
{250}{}{你有错失机会的风险。你的牧师现在必须让步。来吧，干吧，查特。}
### {251}{}{Kill my father? You're offering the unthinkable...}
{251}{}{杀了我父亲？你提供了不可思议的。。。}
### {252}{}{Sorry. Forget what you heard.}
{252}{}{很抱歉忘记你听到的。}
### {253}{}{Do it for the future of your tribe. Your padre and the rest of the elders are leading the tribe to the abyss.}
{253}{}{为你部落的未来而努力。你的牧师和其他长老正在带领部落走向深渊。}
### {254}{}{(Looks at his hands, nodding at your words for a long time, then silently looks up and walks away towards the sanctuary.)}
{254}{}{（看着他的手，对你的话点了很长时间的点头，然后默默地抬起头，朝着圣地走去。）}
### {255}{}{Don't worry, Chatto. This conversation did not happen.}
{255}{}{别担心，查特。这次谈话没有发生。}
### {256}{}{Phoenix is actively developing slavery throughout Southern Arizona. The villa has already become a victim.}
{256}{}{菲尼克斯正在亚利桑那州南部积极发展奴隶制。别墅已经成为受害者。}
### {257}{}{Phoenix cooperates with the tinsmiths who enslave the tribes. None of them can be trusted.}
{257}{}{菲尼克斯与奴役部落的铁匠合作。他们谁都不可信。}
### {258}{}{There is another person who is bothering you and your tribe. What are you going to do with Ranger?}
{258}{}{还有另一个人在困扰你和你的部落。你打算怎么处置流浪者？}
### {259}{}{I'll have to kick him out of the pueblo. Let him leave here in peace.}
{259}{}{我得把他踢出普韦布洛。让他平静地离开这里。}

### {260}{}{What's going on there? I saw shamans running into the sanctuary...}
{260}{}{那里发生了什么事？我看到萨满跑进圣地。。。}
### {261}{}{Your padre has passed away. Now you have to lead the tribe. And you know where.}
{261}{}{你的牧师去世了。现在你必须领导这个部落。你知道在哪里。}
### {262}{}{He... died? But... Wait, let me put this in my head.}
{262}{}{他死了？但是等等，让我把这个记在脑子里。}
### {263}{}{Sure. Think carefully about what to do next.}
{263}{}{当然仔细考虑下一步该做什么。}
### {264}{}{If you hurry, you will have time to take power into your own hands. Come on, make an alliance with the Phoenix, as you wanted.}
{264}{}{如果你抓紧时间，你将有时间把权力掌握在自己手中。来吧，按照你的意愿和凤凰城结盟。}
### {265}{}{Precisely! This is my chance. And there's no way I'm going to let these stupid old men ruin everything again. (escapes to the sanctuary)}
{265}{}{精确地这是我的机会。我不可能再让这些愚蠢的老人毁了一切。（逃到避难所）}
### {266}{}{Hoi, Chatto!}
{266}{}{会，查特！}
### {267}{}{You may have heard about the Phoenix explosion. Do you want such allies?}
{267}{}{你可能听说过凤凰城爆炸案。你想要这样的盟友吗？}
### {268}{}{Then you will be interested in the history of Quartz. Listen carefully...}
{268}{}{然后你会对石英的历史感兴趣。仔细听。。。}
### {269}{}{The Flagstaff colony uses slave labor on Phoenix caps.}
{269}{}{弗拉格斯塔夫殖民地在凤凰城的帽子上使用奴隶劳动。}

### {270}{}{Now I will lead the tribe in a different direction. The old people won't be able to stop me.}
{270}{}{现在我将带领部落走向不同的方向。老人们无法阻止我。}
### {271}{}{I think you know what to do. Bye.}
{271}{}{我想你知道该怎么办了。再见。}
### {272}{}{So, are you ready to form an alliance with the Phoenix missionaries?}
{272}{}{那么，你准备好与凤凰城的传教士结盟了吗？}
### {273}{}{That's exactly what I'm going to do. Tell Commander Crook I'm ready to smoke a pipe of peace with him... Or sit down at the negotiating table. Isn't that what they say in the city?}
{273}{}{这正是我要做的。告诉克鲁克指挥官，我已经准备好和他和平相处了。。。或者坐在谈判桌前。这不是城里人说的吗？}
### {274}{}{Peace and prosperity, Chief.}
{274}{}{和平与繁荣，酋长。}
### {275}{}{Okay. Bye.}
{275}{}{可以再见}
### {276}{}{By the way, it would be nice to reopen the caravan route to Garage City. What do you think?}
{276}{}{顺便说一句，如果能重新开放前往车库城的商队路线，那就太好了。你觉得怎么样？}
### {277}{}{It seems to be a Phoenix colony in the north that sells old items from the ruins? I think it will be useful for the tribe to get new things. Tell Ronnie to look into this matter.}
{277}{}{它似乎是北方的凤凰城殖民地，出售废墟中的旧物品？我认为部落获得新东西会很有用。叫罗尼调查一下这件事。}

### {278}{}{You can read, can't you? Then read the diaries of the missionary commander. I managed to steal them from the camp.}
{278}{}{你会读书，不是吗？然后阅读传教士指挥官的日记。我设法把它们从营地偷走了。}
### {279}{}{...What? What does he write? What does it mean? "Dirty savages.".. "drive into the reservation.".. "take away the weapons.".. And this is the plan he is going to propose to his emperor? Damn it, the Dark Brahmin himself must have clouded my mind.}
{279}{}{什么他写什么？这是什么意思？“肮脏的野蛮人”…“开车进入保留地”…“拿走武器”……这就是他要向他的皇帝提出的计划吗？该死的，黑暗婆罗门自己一定把我弄糊涂了。}
### {280}{}{Chatto, the chiefs and rangers are unhappy with you and your people.}
{280}{}{查特，酋长和护林员对你和你的人民很不满。}
### {281}{}{I know. Otherwise, I wouldn't have had to fight this fight. The chiefs are wrong, the tribe MUST change. Because the world has changed. Otherwise, the tribe will not survive.}
{281}{}{我知道。否则，我就不用打这场仗了。酋长们错了，部落必须改变。因为世界已经改变了。否则，部落将无法生存。}
### {282}{}{Okay, I'm not going to argue with you.}
{282}{}{好吧，我不会和你争论的。}
### {283}{}{Maybe they're just not ready for change?}
{283}{}{也许他们还没有做好改变的准备？}
### {284}{}{And when will that day come? When will all the old people be in the Heavenly Pastures? During this time, the Phoenix Empire will crush us with its weapons and technologies.}
{284}{}{那一天什么时候到来？什么时候所有的老人都会来到天堂牧场？在此期间，凤凰帝国将用其武器和技术摧毁我们。}
### {285}{}{What does it take for you to finally open your eyes?}
{285}{}{你需要什么才能最终睁开眼睛？}
### {286}{}{Prove to me that Rangers are the best choice. Maybe they have already distinguished themselves somewhere in the wastelands? Or tell me what the alliance with the Phoenix promises us. Are there any examples that will change my attitude? Maybe there are bad plans in the missionaries' camp to seize San Brahmin, but until I get confirmation of this, I will not change my mind.}
{286}{}{向我证明流浪者是最好的选择。也许他们已经在荒原上的某个地方崭露头角了？或者告诉我与凤凰城的联盟对我们的承诺。有什么例子会改变我的态度吗？也许传教士阵营中有夺取圣婆罗门的坏计划，但在我得到证实之前，我不会改变主意。}
### {287}{}{Okay. I'll think about it.}
{287}{}{可以我会考虑的。}
### {288}{}{You're running ahead of everyone, Chatto. Like a brahmin straying from the herd. You don't know where you're going.}
{288}{}{你跑在所有人的前面，查特。就像一个浪迹天涯的婆罗门。你不知道自己要去哪里。}
### {289}{}{I don't think so...}
{289}{}{我不这么认为。。。}
### {290}{}{Brahmins are herd animals. This is the only way they can protect themselves from enemies. A single brahmin is doomed.}
{290}{}{婆罗门是群居动物。这是他们保护自己免受敌人攻击的唯一方法。一个婆罗门注定要失败。}
### {291}{}{(sigh) So what should I do? Advise me, because you and I are similar, peasant. Stay in the camp and protect his lousy lifestyle? Or continue the struggle with moldy old people living in the past?}
{291}{}{（叹气）那我该怎么办？建议我，因为你和我很相似，农民。呆在营地里，保护他糟糕的生活方式？还是继续与生活在过去的发霉老人作斗争？}
### {1291}{}{(sigh) So what should I do? Advise me, because you and I are similar, peasant. Stay in the camp and protect his lousy lifestyle? Or continue the struggle with moldy old people living in the past?}
{1291}{}{（叹气）那我该怎么办？建议我，因为你和我很相似，农民。呆在营地里，保护他糟糕的生活方式？还是继续与生活在过去的发霉老人作斗争？}
### {292}{}{I don't know, Chatto. I am also wondering this question. Let's put this conversation on hold for now, okay?}
{292}{}{我不知道，查特。我也想知道这个问题。让我们暂时搁置这段对话，好吗？}
### {293}{}{Cast your vote for an alliance with the Rangers. You and your companions must return to the tribe as part of the whole.}
{293}{}{投票支持与游骑兵队结盟。你和你的同伴必须作为整体的一部分回到部落。}
### {294}{}{Maybe you're right. I don't know myself anymore... Okay, I'll talk to the others and try to calm them down.}
{294}{}{也许你是对的。我不再了解自己了。。。好吧，我会和其他人谈谈，试着让他们平静下来。}
### {1294}{}{Maybe you're right. I don't know myself anymore... Okay, I'll talk to the others and try to calm them down.}
{1294}{}{也许你是对的。我不再了解自己了。。。好吧，我会和其他人谈谈，试着让他们平静下来。}
### {295}{}{Go, Chatto.}
{295}{}{去吧，查特。}
### {296}{}{I happened to visit Flagstaff. Phoenix created this colony on the lands of the tribe, which was immediately exterminated.}
{296}{}{我碰巧去了弗拉格斯塔夫。菲尼克斯在部落的土地上建立了这个殖民地，并立即被灭绝。}
### {297}{}{It's true? For the sake of his colony, the Phoenix destroys an entire tribe? Hm... I must have seen only what I wanted to see. In war, everyone is looking for their own benefit.}
{297}{}{这是真的吗？为了他的殖民地，凤凰摧毁了整个部落？嗯…我一定只看到了我想看的。在战争中，每个人都在寻找自己的利益。}
### {298}{}{Now you're not going to advocate an alliance with Phoenix?}
{298}{}{现在你不打算主张与菲尼克斯结盟了吗？}
### {299}{}{To be honest, there's some kind of murky story. Never mind.}
{299}{}{老实说，这是一个阴暗的故事。没关系。}
### {300}{}{Since you're in doubt, let's cast lots? Let the Wasteland Spirit decide.}
{300}{}{既然你有疑问，让我们抽签吧？让荒原之灵来决定。}
### {301}{}{I will not rely on chance.}
{301}{}{我不会依靠机会。}
### {302}{}{As you wish.}
{302}{}{如你所愿。}
### {303}{}{OK, let's draw lots... What's it? Does the draw speak in favor of the Rangers?}
{303}{}{好的，让我们抽签。。。它是什么？抽签结果对游骑兵队有利吗？}
### {304}{}{OK, let's draw lots... What's it? Does the die speak in favor of Phoenix?}
{304}{}{好的，让我们抽签。。。它是什么？死者是否支持凤凰？}
### {305}{}{To be honest, I don't like it's a good idea to rely on chance anymore. Forget about this case.}
{305}{}{老实说，我不喜欢再依赖机会了。忘掉这个案子吧。}
### {306}{}{Let's draw lots. Let the Wasteland Spirit decide for you.}
{306}{}{让我们抽签吧。让荒原之灵为你做主。}
