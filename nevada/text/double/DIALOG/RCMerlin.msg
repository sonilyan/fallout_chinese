{230}{}{问得好。纳尔逊甚至会在矿场后的夜晚发光。你可以和他一起省点电费，哈哈！ -- Good question. Nelson would even glow at night after the mines. You could save some money on electricity with him, ha-ha!}
#{231}{}{Is the mine so radioactive?}
{231}{}{地雷有放射性吗？ -- Is the mine so radioactive?}
#{232}{}{Well, not as much as you can think. There is no refined uranium there, only ore. The real radiation was where the ore was processed. And yet it's a sore point for Uranium City. When everything were under Wright, the slaves and free mercenaries worked here. They were prone to make... sacrifices. After all, while being irradiated, you can explore more than a year, until the disease takes its toll. And during this time you can put together enough to feed one's family - or burn your short life out bright and interesting. That's not too bad in our time.}
{232}{}{嗯，没有你想象的那么多。那里没有提炼铀，只有矿石。真正的辐射是矿石加工的地方。然而，这是铀城的痛点。在莱特统治时期，奴隶和自由雇佣兵在这里工作。他们倾向于。。。牺牲。毕竟，在受到辐射的同时，你可以探索一年多，直到疾病夺走生命。在这段时间里，你可以集中足够的钱养活自己的家人――或者把你短暂的生命烧得光鲜有趣。在我们这个时代还不错。 -- Well, not as much as you can think.

{236}{}{嗯，公会并不愚蠢，你知道，他们制定了时间表和规则。你应该戴着橡胶手套和靴子工作，戴上口罩，在进入之前把所有金属都去掉。当然，还有工作时间的规范。那些为了钱而放弃健康的人要对结果负责。典型的时间表是14个小时，然后每个人都来我的酒吧喝酒。腐烂的肠子在河里流淌！ -- Well, the guild weren17t stupid you know, they made schedule and rules.
