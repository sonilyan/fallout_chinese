#{200}{}{You see an older doctor. He appears busy.}
{200}{}{你去看老医生。他看起来很忙。}
#{250}{}{You see doctor Linsday. He's attending to his work.}
{250}{}{你今天去看医生。他在专心工作。}
#{300}{}{I have nothing more to tell you.}
{300}{}{我没什么要告诉你的了。}
#{400}{}{You're making a big mistake!}
{400}{}{你犯了个大错！}
#{500}{}{Hi, you seem to be new here. I'm doctor Linsday. What brings you to me?}
{500}{}{嗨，你好像是新来的。我是林斯戴医生。什么风把你吹来？}
#{501}{}{Hi, you seem to be new here. I'm doctor Linsday. What brings you to me?}
{501}{}{嗨，你好像是新来的。我是林斯戴医生。什么风把你吹来？}
#{502}{}{I need your help doc.}
{502}{}{我需要你的帮助医生。}
#{503}{}{Sheriff Francis sent me. I'm investigating the recent murders. I want to know what've you managed to find out by examining the body of the latest victim.}
{503}{}{弗朗西斯警长派我来的。我正在调查最近的谋杀案。我想知道你通过检查最新受害者的尸体发现了什么。}
#{506}{}{Can I ask you about Vodka? I heard you treated him after he almost burned to death in a fire.}
{506}{}{我能问一下伏特加吗？我听说他在火灾中差点被烧死后你给他做了治疗。}
#{504}{}{Actually, nothing. Goodbye.}
{504}{}{实际上，没什么。再见。}
#{505}{}{He?!}
{505}{}{他？！}
#{550}{}{What exactly is the problem?}
{550}{}{到底是什么问题？}
#{551}{}{I'm injured.}
{551}{}{我受伤了。}

{555}{}{马里奥受伤了。}
#{556}{}{My dog Mutt doesn't look very good.}
{556}{}{我的狗小狗看起来不太好。}
#{557}{}{A strange thing happened to me. A sixth toe grew on my foot.}
{557}{}{一件奇怪的事发生在我身上。我脚上长了第六个脚趾。}
#{558}{}{I'm interested to hear what you know about the disease AIDS?}
{558}{}{我想听听你对艾滋病的了解？}
#{559}{}{Oh, I can't remember. I'll better go.}
{559}{}{哦，我不记得了。我还是走吧。}
#{600}{}{It's good that someone is finally paying serious attention to this matter. That murderer has been on the loose for several weeks now and the police haven't managed to do anything effective. Unfortunately, I can't help you as much as I would've hoped. The autopsy didn't provide much. The deep gashes on the body indicate a quick and confident action on the part of the attacker, and the tongue was cut out with great skill. Most striking, however, was the weapon used. The murderer attacked with a knife such as I have never come across before. The blade must have a very unique shape. That could be a good clue for further investigation.}
{600}{}{很高兴终于有人认真地注意到这件事了。那个杀人犯已经逍遥法外好几个星期了，警察还没有采取有效措施。不幸的是，我不能像我希望的那样帮你。尸检没有提供多少证据。身上深深的伤口表明攻击者动作迅速而自信，舌头被以高超的技巧割断。然而，最引人注目的是使用的武器。杀人犯用我从未见过的刀子袭击。刀片必须有一个非常独特的形状。这可能是进一步调查的好线索。}
#{601}{}{Maybe it could, thank you. Goodbye doc.}
{601}{}{也许可以，谢谢。再见，医生。}
#{650}{}{[Dr. Linsday examines you.] Luckily, it's nothing serious. I can fix you for 50 caps.}

#{1050}{}{[He examines your excrescence.] Yes, this happens sometimes. There is a high probability that you were exposed to a substantial level of radiation.

#{1103}{}{I don't have that much money anyway. Let it be.}
{1103}{}{反正我也没那么多钱。顺其自然。}
#{1150}{}{[Dr. Linsday reflects for a short while.] It was a vicious, terminal disease in the times before the war. It was caused by the retrovirus HIV. An infected individual would experience a failure of their immune system and subsequently even a trivial disease could lead to their death. Why do you ask?}
{1150}{}{[林斯戴医生沉思了一会儿]在战前的时代，这是一种恶性的绝症。它是由逆转录病毒引起的。一个被感染的个体会经历免疫系统的衰竭，随后即使是一个微不足道的疾病也可能导致他们的死亡。你为什么问？}
#{1151}{}{I might have it.}
{1151}{}{我可能有。}
#{1200}{}{I doubt that. As I said already, it is a very old disease. Personally, I haven't heard about a contemporary case of infection. I wouldn't even be able to treat it, no one here in the wasteland would. Only the people from the vault in Albuquerque could possibly have a cure, but I don't think they would make it available to an outsider. In any case, you really have nothing to fear in my opinion. The likelihood of infection is minimal.}
{1200}{}{我对此表示怀疑。我已经说过了，这是一种非常古老的疾病。就我个人而言，我还没有听说过当代的感染病例。我甚至无法治疗它，荒地里没有人会。只有阿尔伯克基地下室的人可能有治愈的方法，但我不认为他们会让外人知道。无论如何，在我看来，你真的没什么好怕的。感染的可能性很小。}

#{1315}{}{Tell me more about the doctors from the hospital. Were they always based in Albuquerque?}
{1315}{}{告诉我更多关于医院医生的情况。他们总是驻扎在阿尔伯克基吗？}

{1350}{}{对不起，我现在不能抽出一点时间给你。他们给我带来了一个重伤病人。}
#{1351}{}{What happened to him?}
{1351}{}{他怎么了？}
#{1352}{}{I won't be interrupting you then.}
{1352}{}{那我就不打扰你了。}
#{1353}{}{Uh.}
{1353}{}{休斯敦大学。}
#{1400}{}{[Dr. Linsday sighs.] It's a miner. Part of a ceiling collapsed on him when he was working in the mine. He has no visible injuries other than a few bruises, yet he lost consciousness anyway. I fear that his brain was damaged.}
{1400}{}{是个矿工。当他在矿井里工作时，天花板的一部分塌了下来。他除了几处瘀伤外，没有明显的伤痕，但他还是失去了知觉。我担心他的大脑受损了。}
#{1401}{}{Are you able to help him?}
{1401}{}{你能帮助他吗？}
#{1402}{}{I see. I won't be interrupting you then.}
{1402}{}{我懂了。那我就不打扰你了。}
#{1450}{}{That's what is the worst about this case. I'm afraid I can't. Brain surgery requires absolutely accurate and immensely dexterous hands. But my own hands have been neither of those for ages now. I would most likely fail at such a challenging procedure. I don't want to risk it unless it is absolutely necessary. There is at least a small chance that the patient's body will deal with the injury on its own.}
{1450}{}{这就是这个案子最糟糕的地方。恐怕不行。脑外科手术需要绝对准确和非常灵巧的手。但我自己的手已经很久没有这样了。我很可能会在这样一个具有挑战性的过程中失败。除非绝对必要，否则我不想冒险。病人的身体至少有一小部分可能会自行处理损伤。}
#{1451}{}{I'm good at medicine. Maybe I could perform the surgery in your stead.}
{1451}{}{我擅长医学。也许我可以替你做手术。}
#{1452}{}{I'm good at medicine. Maybe I could perform the surgery in your stead.}

#{1453}{}{Hopefully. Goodbye doc.}
{1453}{}{有希望地。再见，医生。}
#{1500}{}{You think you can handle it? It is a very difficult procedure. It's not worth trying it unless you're entirely certain about your medical abilities.}
{1500}{}{你觉得你能应付吗？这是一个非常困难的过程。除非你完全确定自己的医疗能力，否则不值得尝试。}
#{1501}{}{You think you can handle it? It is a very difficult procedure. It's not worth trying it unless you're entirely certain about your medical abilities.}

{1502}{}{我肯定。我们可以开始了。}
#{1503}{}{I am certain. We can start.}
{1503}{}{我肯定。我们可以开始了。}
#{1505}{}{How about letting Lystra do the surgery?}
{1505}{}{让莱斯特拉做手术怎么样？}
#{1504}{}{I guess you're right. I'll let it be.}
{1504}{}{我想你是对的。我就这样算了。}
#{1550}{}{Very well then. I will prepare everything that's needed for the surgery at once.}
{1550}{}{那好吧。我马上准备手术所需的一切。}
#{1551}{}{[Wait.]}
{1551}{}{[等等。]}
#{1600}{}{You did an excellent job. That man owes his survival to you and you alone. Both of us owe you a huge dept. Please, take this. [He gives you an ultra stimpak.] It's just a modest reward for saving a man's life.}

#{1700}{}{His condition went from bad to worse and I had to proceed with the surgery. At first he was holding up well, but then he started to bleed heavily. [Dr. Linsday sighs.] This resulted in his death.}
{1700}{}{他的病情每况愈下，我不得不继续做手术。起初他挺得很好，但后来开始大量流血。这导致了他的死亡。}
#{1701}{}{I'm sorry to hear that. I'll come back later.}
{1701}{}{听到这个消息我很难过。我一会儿回来。}
#{1750}{}{Eh, what can I do for you? Are you hurt?}

#{1800}{}{[He examines you.] Well, I can't charge you money anyway when you're in this state. I'll have a look at it.}
{1800}{}{[他检查你]好吧，你在这种状态下，我不能向你收费。我去看看。}
#{1801}{}{Yaaay! [Let him treat you.]}
{1801}{}{耶！[让他治疗你。]}
#{1850}{}{And now you can go.}
{1850}{}{现在你可以走了。}
#{1851}{}{Thankyoo!}
{1851}{}{谢谢你！}
#{1900}{}{Yes, certainly. As the victor you have every right to it. [He hands it to you.] I'm sincerely happy that the accursed tool won't stay here. It's creeping me out.}
{1900}{}{是的，当然。作为胜利者，你完全有权这么做。[他把它交给你]我真的很高兴这个该死的工具不会留在这里。它让我毛骨悚然。}
#{1901}{}{Yes, certainly. As the victor you have every right to it. [He hands it to you.] I'm sincerely happy that the accursed tool won't stay here. It's creeping me out.}
{1901}{}{是的，当然。作为胜利者，你完全有权这么做。[他把它交给你]我真的很高兴这个该死的工具不会留在这里。它让我毛骨悚然。}
#{1902}{}{Thank you doc.}
{1902}{}{谢谢你，医生。}
#{2000}{}{[Dr. Linsday turns to you.] I'm sorry that I couldn't give her better news. When she feels like it, you can take Lystra to the local cemetery to visit her brother's grave. It's the one with an unmarked cross in the first row. No one knew what inscription to put on it. Sadly, Sindian was virtually unknown around here.}
{2000}{}{[Linsday医生转向你]很抱歉我不能告诉她更好的消息。当她喜欢的时候，你可以带莱斯特拉去当地的公墓参观她哥哥的坟墓。这是第一排没有标记的十字架。没人知道要在上面刻什么。可悲的是，辛迪安在这里几乎无人知晓。}
#{2001}{}{How is that possible? Didn't he spend quite some time here?}
{2001}{}{这怎么可能？他不是在这里待了很长时间吗？}
#{2002}{}{Thanky.}
{2002}{}{谢谢。}
#{2050}{}{He didn't dwell in the town at all. He was always out of Corath, traveling in the wasteland. People used to say that he is searching for something. But he did not have dealings with anyone, he only came here to get new supplies. I never saw him before... that last night.}
{2050}{}{他根本不住在城里。他总是离开科拉斯，在荒地里旅行。人们常说他在寻找什么。但他没有和任何人打交道，他只是来这里买新的补给。我以前从没见过他。。。昨天晚上。}
#{2051}{}{Where do you know Lystra from?}
{2051}{}{你从哪里认识莱斯特拉？}
#{2052}{}{Thank you doc.}
{2052}{}{谢谢你，医生。}
#{2100}{}{I met her in Albuquerque. You could say that she saved me. I worked in the hospital for the doctors in Dead Quarter and she was looking for some patients there. I was a blind fool then, and only her investigation made me realize it. I was only really excited that I can use top-quality medical equipment, and I didn't really pay attention to what was really happening around me.}
{2100}{}{我在阿尔伯克基见过她。你可以说她救了我。我在医院为死区的医生工作，她在那里找病人。当时我是个瞎子，只有她的调查才让我意识到这一点。我只是对我能使用一流的医疗设备感到非常兴奋，而我并没有真正注意到我周围发生的事情。}
#{2101}{}{What do you mean?}
{2101}{}{什么意思？}
#{2150}{}{What I mean is that Falber and his associates kill people in the hospital like it was nothing! Just so they can get their organs! And then they sell those organs to patients who are rich enough. When I found out, it turned my whole world upside down. I tried to talk about it with a few doctors, but my words fell to deaf ears. They considered those depraved practices to be normal. This is why I left and traveled here to Corath. There was no doctor here at the time, so I could really help people here. Even though my facilities here are very limited, I can finally save lives instead of taking them to enhance the lives of others.}
{2150}{}{我的意思是，福伯和他的同伙在医院里杀人，好像什么都不是！只是为了让他们得到他们的器官！然后他们把这些器官卖给有钱的病人。当我发现的时候，我的整个世界都颠倒了。我试着和几个医生谈这件事，但我的话被置之不理。他们认为那些堕落的行为是正常的。这就是我离开去科拉斯的原因。当时这里没有医生，所以我真的可以帮助这里的人。尽管我在这里的设施非常有限，但我最终可以拯救生命，而不是带着它们去改善别人的生活。}
#{2151}{}{I see. That will be all doc. Goodbye.}
{2151}{}{我懂了。就这些了，医生。再见。}
#{2152}{}{I understand. Tell me more about the doctors from the hospital. Were they always based in Albuquerque?}

#{2217}{}{Can I ask you about Vodka? I heard that you treated him after he almost burned during a fire.}
{2217}{}{我能问一下伏特加吗？我听说他在火灾中差点被烧死后你给他做了治疗。}
#{2218}{}{Tell me more about the doctors from the hospital. Were they always based in Albuquerque?}
{2218}{}{告诉我更多关于医院医生的情况。他们总是驻扎在阿尔伯克基吗？}
#{2219}{}{You mentioned Falber. What can you tell me about him?}
{2219}{}{你提到福伯。关于他你能告诉我什么？}
#{2220}{}{I think you should know that the doctors from the hospital are dead. I took care of it.}
{2220}{}{我想你应该知道医院的医生都死了。我处理好了。}
#{2221}{}{I think you should know that the doctors from the hospital are dead. I took care of it.}
{2221}{}{我想你应该知道医院的医生都死了。我处理好了。}
#{2250}{}{But of course! If Lystra performs the surgery, the patient should have the highest chance of survival. I have no doubts that, thanks to her medical experience from the empire, Lystra can deal with everything for the utmost benefit of the patient.}
{2250}{}{但是当然！如果Lystra做了手术，病人应该有最高的生存机会。我毫不怀疑，多亏了她在帝国的医疗经验，丽斯特拉能够处理一切事情，为病人带来最大的利益。}
#{2251}{}{I also know much about medicine. Maybe I could perform the surgery.}
{2251}{}{我对医学也很了解。也许我可以做手术。}
#{2252}{}{I also know much about medicine. Maybe I could perform the surgery.}
{2252}{}{我对医学也很了解。也许我可以做手术。}
#{2253}{}{I agree, we let Lystra perform the surgery.}
{2253}{}{我同意，我们让Lystra做手术。}
#{2254}{}{Will see, we're going to think about it with Lystra.}
{2254}{}{等着瞧，我们会和莱斯特拉一起考虑的。}
#{2300}{}{Excellent. I will prepare everything that's needed for the surgery at once.}
{2300}{}{杰出的。我马上准备手术所需的一切。}
#{2301}{}{[Wait while doctor Linsday and Lystra prepare for the surgery.]}
{2301}{}{[等待Linsday医生和Lystra准备手术。]}
#{2350}{}{[Dr. Linsday smiles at you.] Lystra did a great job, there is no doubt about it. I'm happy that you stopped by. Please take this. [He gives you an ultra stimpak.] It's only a small reward for saving a life.}
{2350}{}{毫无疑问，莱斯特拉做得很好。我很高兴你过来。请拿着这个。[他给了你一个超刺激物]这只是救了一条命的一个小奖励。}
#{2351}{}{Thanks doc, I'm sure we can put it to good use.}
{2351}{}{谢谢医生，我相信我们可以好好利用它。}
#{2400}{}{[Dr. Linsday nods thoughtfully.] Vodka was one of my most difficult cases. Once at dawn, he was brought here by five of Uncle's men, more dead than alive. The fire inflicted many burns on his body, which soon became inflamed. I had to perform the surgery immediately. It was a miracle that I managed to keep Vodka alive, but his chances of recovery were very slim. The following days were critical. Vodka must have been in excruciating pain, but he refused to give up. His condition started to improve. When he could barely walk again he already wanted to leave. I'm not sure, whether he even realizes that he survived his own death. He had incredible luck.}
{2400}{}{[林斯戴医生若有所思地点头]伏特加是我最难对付的案子之一。有一次天亮时，他被叔叔的五个手下带到这里，死的比活的还多。大火使他的身体多次烧伤，很快就发炎了。我必须马上做手术。我能让伏特加活下来真是个奇迹，但他康复的机会非常渺茫。接下来的日子很关键。伏特加一定很痛苦，但他拒绝放弃。他的病情开始好转。当他几乎不能再走的时候，他已经想离开了。我不确定，他是否意识到自己活了下来。他运气很好。}
#{2401}{}{I don't think Vodka feels the same way about it. Bye doc.}
{2401}{}{我觉得伏特加的感觉不一样。再见，医生。}
#{2450}{}{[He shakes his head.] They only settled in Albuquerque later. It started with Falber and his idea that he'd sell his medical expertise in the wasteland, just like any other commodity. He traveled from one place to another with an armed escort and offered his services to anyone who could afford them. He achieved great success and was able to hire more doctors who started to work as his helpers. That's how I joined him too. Falber only settled in Albuquerque when traveling became too dangerous. And probably another reason for settling was that the ruined city offers him ample opportunities for his depraved experiments.}
{2450}{}{[他摇摇头]他们后来才在阿尔伯克基定居下来。它始于福伯和他的想法，他会出售他的医疗专业知识在荒地，就像任何其他商品。他带着武装护卫从一个地方到另一个地方，并向任何有能力的人提供服务。他取得了巨大的成功，并能雇用更多的医生开始作为他的助手工作。我也是这样加入他的。当旅行变得太危险时，法伯才在阿尔伯克基定居下来。定居的另一个原因可能是，这座废墟城市为他提供了进行堕落实验的充分机会。}
#{2451}{}{What can you tell me about Falber?}
{2451}{}{关于法伯你能告诉我什么？}
#{2452}{}{Thanks for the information. Goodbye doc.}
{2452}{}{谢谢你的消息。再见，医生。}
#{2500}{}{He is a monster in a human body. He is the originator of all the bestiality happening in the hospital. I can't even guess whether he does it for money or because such practices bring him pleasure. I only know that he betrayed all the principles that a true doctor should follow. It is terrifying to think that he is using his incredible medical knowledge for such repulsive purposes.}
{2500}{}{他是人体内的怪物。他是医院里所有兽行的始作俑者。我甚至猜不出他这样做是为了钱，还是因为这样的做法给他带来了乐趣。我只知道他背叛了一个真正的医生应该遵循的所有原则。想到他把他那不可思议的医学知识用于如此令人厌恶的目的，真是可怕。}
#{2501}{}{It certainly is. Tell me more about the doctors from the hospital. Were they always based in Albuquerque?}
{2501}{}{当然是。告诉我更多关于医院医生的情况。他们总是驻扎在阿尔伯克基吗？}
#{2502}{}{Thanks for the information. Goodbye doc.}
{2502}{}{谢谢你的消息。再见，医生。}
#{2550}{}{[He looks taken aback.] Oh that's... unexpected. Sorry that I don't show enthusiasm, but it is always a sad event for a doctor when a human life, no matter how depraved, is extinguished. I cannot feel differently. Especially since I hoped, deep in my soul, that there was still a chance for some of them. Even though none of them listened to me when I was leaving the hospital. Still, maybe under proper guidance and without Falber's influence, they would be able to really help people. So many skilled doctors with extensive knowledge of medicine worked there...}
{2550}{}{[他看起来大吃一惊]哦那是。。。出乎意料。很抱歉，我没有表现出热情，但当一个人的生命，无论多么堕落，被熄灭时，对一个医生来说总是一件悲哀的事情。我没有什么不同的感觉。尤其是在我内心深处，我希望他们中的一些人还有机会。即使我离开医院时他们都不听我的话。不过，也许在适当的指导下，没有法伯的影响，他们能够真正帮助人们。那么多精通医学的熟练医生在那里工作。。。}
#{2551}{}{I understand doc. Goodbye.}
{2551}{}{我明白，医生。再见。}

#{6018}{}{Stop with the titles, next to you I'm just a simple healer. I'm trying to help, within my abilities. But really, I wouldn't expect to see you here, so far from the empire and from Albuquerque.}
{6018}{}{别提头衔了，在你旁边我只是个简单的治疗者。我在力所能及的范围内尽力帮忙。但说真的，我不希望在这里见到你，离帝国和阿尔伯克基这么远。}
#{6019}{}{I'm looking for my brother. I found out that he traveled to Corath. ::She described Sindian.:: Have you seen him here? Do you know something about him?}
{6019}{}{我在找我弟弟。我发现他去了科拉斯。●她描述了辛迪安。：：你在这里见过他吗？你了解他吗？}
#{6020}{}{::He was lost in memories for a moment and suddenly the smile on his face froze.:: That was your brother? I think I know who you mean. I had no idea... I am so sorry. He is dead. I...}
{6020}{}{●他一时沉浸在回忆中，突然脸上的笑容冻结了：那是你哥哥？我想我知道你的意思。我不知道。。。我很抱歉。他死了。一、 。。。}
#{6021}{}{What?! Sindian! That's not possible. You must be mistaken. That... How?}
{6021}{}{什么？！辛迪安！那是不可能的。你一定弄错了。那个。。。怎么用？}
#{6022}{}{I don't really know. That night he came here for the first time. He was hurt, shot twice. He barely made it here and died within my doors. There was nothing to be done, he lost too much blood.}
{6022}{}{我真的不知道。那天晚上他第一次来这里。他受伤了，中了两枪。他勉强来到这里，死在我的门前。没什么可干的，他失血过多。}
#{6023}{}{But... didn't he say... }
{6023}{}{但是。。。他不是说。。。}
#{6024}{}{No, he had no time to say anything. Only, in his hand he was tightly holding a talisman. The last time I saw one like that was in Albuquerque. It was a talisman of the Rebirth.}
{6024}{}{不，他没有时间说什么。只是，他手里紧紧握着一个护身符。我最后一次看到这样的是在阿尔伯克基。它是重生的护身符。}
#{6025}{}{That... them... ghouls... ::She stares into the empty air and tears flow from her eyes.::}
{6025}{}{那个。。。他们。。。僵尸。。。●她凝视着空荡荡的空气，眼泪从眼眶里流了出来：}
#{6026}{}{Most likely. My deepest condolences! I am really sorry. Please, rest for a moment and collect your thoughts. You can stay for as long as you wish.}
{6026}{}{很有可能。我最深切的哀悼！我真的很抱歉。请休息一会儿，集中思想。你想呆多久就呆多久。}
