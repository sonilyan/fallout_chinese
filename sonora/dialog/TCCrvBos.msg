### {100}{}{This is Merchant Clark.}
{100}{}{我是Merchant Clark。}
### {101}{}{You see the caravan manager. His swarthy skin speaks of uncounted miles of travel traveled under the scorching sun.}
{101}{}{你看到商队经理了。他黝黑的皮肤诉说着在炎炎烈日下旅行了无数英里。}
### {102}{}{Have a good trip.}
{102}{}{祝你旅途愉快。}
### {103}{}{We're here. Up the road is the Brotherhood of Steel Fort.}
{103}{}{我们到了。这条路上是钢铁兄弟会堡垒。}

### {200}{}{What do you want?}
{200}{}{你想要什么？}
### {201}{}{Maybe we can get acquainted? In a strange city, I would like to have a couple of contacts.}
{201}{}{也许我们可以认识一下？在一个陌生的城市，我想有几个联系人。}
### {202}{}{Then you're out of luck with the interlocutor. I am engaged in caravanning. And I have a special contract with tinsmiths, the last thing I need is extra acquaintances. Although I can understand you - I was a stranger in this city myself when I first came here.}
{202}{}{那么你和对话者的运气就不好了。我从事房车旅行。我和锡匠有一份特殊的合同，我最不需要的就是额外的熟人。虽然我能理解你的意思，但当我第一次来到这里时，我自己也是这个城市的陌生人。}
### {203}{}{Looks like you have something to ask.}
{203}{}{看来你有什么要问的。}

### {210}{}{What do you want?}
{210}{}{你想要什么？}
### {211}{}{Nothing.}
{211}{}{没有什么}
### {212}{}{I don't mind chatting some more.}
{212}{}{我不介意再聊几句。}

### {220}{}{What are you doing?}
{220}{}{你在干什么？}
### {221}{}{I transport cargo across the desert. The tinkerers trust me with this case like no one else.}
{221}{}{我运送货物穿越沙漠。修补匠们在这个案子上信任我，这是独一无二的。}
### {222}{}{Hauling cargo across the desert? Who needs him there?}
{222}{}{运输货物穿越沙漠？谁需要他在那里？}
### {223}{}{Sounds unconvincing, but there really are a couple of places in the desert where our cargo is very much expected. And they pay great caps for it.}
{223}{}{听起来不太令人信服，但沙漠中确实有几个地方对我们的货物寄予厚望。他们为此付出了高昂的代价。}
### {224}{}{Are slaves also a marketable commodity there?}
{224}{}{奴隶在那里也是有市场的商品吗？}
### {225}{}{Not anymore. Previously, they were driven there in droves from Phoenix to clear ruins and build settlements. But now there is no such need. But slaves became popular in the northern direction.}
{225}{}{不再是了。此前，他们成群结队地从凤凰城赶到那里，清理废墟并建造定居点。但现在没有这样的必要了。但是奴隶在北方很受欢迎。}
### {226}{}{This Phoenix - where is it?}
{226}{}{这只凤凰在哪里？}
### {227}{}{You really don't know? Oh, so you missed a lot. It's a big city in the north. Go along the 10th Federal highway, you won't miss it.}
{227}{}{你真的不知道吗？哦，所以你错过了很多。这是北方的一个大城市。沿着第十条联邦高速公路走，你不会错过的。}
### {1227}{}{You really don't know? Oh, so you missed a lot. It's a big city in the north. Go along the 10th federal highway, you won't miss it.}
{1227}{}{你真的不知道吗？哦，所以你错过了很多。这是北方的一个大城市。沿着第十条联邦高速公路走，你不会错过的。}
### {228}{}{Thank you.}
{228}{}{非常感谢。}

### {230}{}{So who are the tinkerers really?}
{230}{}{那么，修补匠到底是谁呢？}
### {231}{}{Something like a cult, they worship technology and progress. Their most cherished dream is to find robotic bodies and upload their consciousness into them. Sounds fantastic, right? But they are already implanting some kind of hardware in themselves. And with their technical skills, no one in all of Sonora can compare.}
{231}{}{有点像邪教，他们崇拜技术和进步。他们最珍视的梦想是找到机器人的身体，并将他们的意识上传到其中。听起来很棒，对吧？但他们已经在自己身上植入了某种硬件。以他们的技术水平，在索诺拉没有人能与之相比。}
### {232}{}{What are their immediate plans?}
{232}{}{他们近期的计划是什么？}
### {233}{}{I don't know, I'm just moving cargo. But the tinkerers are clearly planning something big.}
{233}{}{我不知道，我只是在搬运货物。但修修补补的人显然正在计划一件大事。}
### {234}{}{Why did you decide that?}
{234}{}{你为什么这么决定？}
### {235}{}{They buy up a lot of uranium ore and slaves. They must have taken up a large accumulation of old equipment. And this is fraught with serious investments in Phoenix or somewhere else. Oh, yes, I can already smell the bait for my caravan for the coming years.}
{235}{}{他们购买了大量的铀矿和奴隶。他们一定占用了大量的旧设备。这里面充满了对凤凰城或其他地方的大量投资。哦，是的，我已经闻到了我的房车未来几年的诱饵味。}
### {236}{}{Aren't you going to the place where the whole port was blown up recently?}
{236}{}{你不是要去最近整个港口被炸毁的地方吗？}
### {237}{}{Well, there's almost nothing left now. But there are still Casa Nueva plantations on the way. However, how long will he have the strength to survive without the protection of the Brotherhood of Steel? Sooner or later, the settlement will obey the will of the tinsmiths or become empty.}
{237}{}{嗯，现在几乎什么都没有了。但仍有Casa Nueva种植园在路上。然而，如果没有钢铁兄弟会的保护，他还能活多久？定居点迟早会服从铁匠的意愿，或者变成空的。}
### {238}{}{It looks like life there will get worse anyway. Let's change the subject?}
{238}{}{看起来那里的生活无论如何都会变得更糟。我们换个话题吧？}

### {240}{}{Is it hard to carry cargo through the wastelands?}
{240}{}{在荒原上搬运货物难吗？}
### {241}{}{We are masters in this business. We have to adapt and wait for the most suitable seasons for traveling.}
{241}{}{我们是这方面的大师。我们必须适应并等待最适合旅行的季节。}
### {242}{}{What dangers await in the barren lands of Sonora?}
{242}{}{索诺拉贫瘠的土地上还有什么危险？}
### {243}{}{Of course, first of all it is dehydration and lack of food. We take the water in advance in Casa Grande. This is enough to walk to the Bay. And there we are already desalinating the sea liquid.}
{243}{}{当然，首先是脱水和缺乏食物。我们在格兰德之家提前取水。这足够步行去海湾了。在那里，我们已经在淡化海水。}
### {244}{}{What about the game?}
{244}{}{游戏怎么样？}
### {245}{}{No one will survive in such sands except radscorpions. It looks like they have looked after Sonora for breeding their offspring. But we almost did not meet robbers. People are rare in those places.}
{245}{}{除了蝎子，没有人能在这样的沙子里生存。看起来他们一直在照顾索诺拉以繁殖后代。但我们几乎没有遇到强盗。在那些地方很少有人。}
### {246}{}{Your story only fuels my curiosity. Tell me more.}
{246}{}{你的故事只会激发我的好奇心。告诉我更多。}
### {247}{}{Thanks for the information. I'm going to get ready for the trip.}

### {305}{}{Sorry. But maybe you know about other things.}
{305}{}{很抱歉但也许你知道其他事情。}
### {306}{}{Believe me, not a single caravan goes there now. Something went wrong with the Brotherhood of Steel, as a result, their ship exploded like a damn demolition beetle. Now instead of a ship there is a radioactive funnel and not a single living soul.}
{306}{}{相信我，现在没有一个商队去那里。钢铁兄弟会出了问题，结果他们的船像一只该死的拆迁甲虫一样爆炸了。现在，取而代之的是一艘放射性漏斗，而不是一个活着的灵魂。}
### {307}{}{That's right... surprise.}
{307}{}{没错。。。惊喜}
### {308}{}{I don't think so.}

### {401}{}{What can you tell us about this settlement?}
{401}{}{关于这个解决方案，你能告诉我们什么？}
### {402}{}{Casa Nueva is a blooming oasis in the middle of the desert. This is the best place to live among all that I know. But the conditions here are quite tough. Behave especially respectfully and carefully with the local population.}
{402}{}{努瓦之家是沙漠中央一片盛开的绿洲。这是我所知道的最好的住处。但这里的条件相当艰苦。对当地人表现得特别尊重和谨慎。}
