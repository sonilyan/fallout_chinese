{102}{}{Who the hell are you? A mailman? Hah! This is no good place to be delivering mail. In fact, I can't let
 you leave this place alive, but hey! I can guarantee you a quick death. [Reaches for his gun.] Before I... remove you,

{103}{}{I'm a simple mercenary, wandering around... killing people... it pays well!}
{104}{}{[You can see traces of blood going into the building.] You've done a half-assed job cleaning up your mess. I'll

{105}{}{Hah! Hahaha, you're a comedian, too? If you say so. Could be useful having someone like you. If you are
 good enough with guns, maybe you can join us. You must prove yourself first, of course. So what's it gonna be?}
{106}{}{Hey, thanks. I sure am funny, huh? Tell you what, I'm gonna take your head then. I like the smile on it,
 asshole! [You reach for your weapon.]}
{107}{}{Prove myself? Maybe I'm crazy, but I'll do it. You've got yourself a deal.}

{108}{}{OK pal, I'll take you to my boss. We're gonna see how good you really are. There's just one more thing...
 you're going blindfolded or you don't go at all, that's the rule.}
{109}{}{Well, if you have to... [Comply.]}
#after 102...
{110}{}{Easy man. I'm just passing through. I don't want any trouble.}
#trouble...
{111}{}{I'm sure you don't, but I do. Perhaps if you give me all your stuff I will let you live.}
{112}{}{Why don't you drop dead, rat-face!}
#
{113}{}{You're supposed to be somewhere else.}
{114}{}{What are you doing here?}
{115}{}{Stop your wandering and get to it!}
