### {40}{}{[The woman gets angry] You have no business here! According to paragraph 4 of our Constitution: "Every inhabitant of the New World has the right to walk around his territory of the New World, without asking permission of other inhabitants of the New World". So, this is my territory, it belongs to Abilene McKinsey! And I didn't give you permission to walk around here! Go walk around yours!}
{40}{}{[那个女人生气了]你在这儿没什么事！根据我国《宪法》第4段：“新世界的每一位居民都有权在其新世界领土上走动，而无需征得新世界其他居民的许可”。所以，这是我的地盘，属于阿比琳・麦肯锡！我没有允许你在这里走动！绕着你的走吧！}

{105}{999}{我现在什么都不需要。稍后再谈。}

### {110}{}{No, I didn't see any book. And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you. Ludwig completely lost his mind with all this hoity-toity tech stuff. He talks to no one, not even to his wife, maybe they don't even sleep together anymore. One time I saw my husband, Boston, hitting on Ludwig's wife, Veronica. Oh, this animal Boston ruined my life, damn womanizer! I spent my best years on him, and he doesn't even respect me!}
{110}{}{没有，我没有看到任何书。即使我这样做了，我也不会告诉你。路德维希对这些高科技的东西完全失去了理智。他不和任何人说话，甚至不和他的妻子说话，也许他们甚至不再睡在一起了。有一次，我看到我的丈夫，波士顿，正在攻击路德维希的妻子维罗妮卡。哦，波士顿这只动物毁了我的生活，该死的花花公子！我在他身上度过了我最好的岁月，而他甚至不尊重我！}

### {120}{}{[Abilene unhappy grumbles] Nothing. I do nothing. [she raises her voice] And I have the right to do so! According to paragraph 10 of our Constitution, "Every inhabitant of the New World has the right to do nothing at all"! I know my rights and not afraid to use them! For example, do you call yourself an inhabitant of the New World, or not? }
{120}{}{[阿比林不高兴地抱怨]什么都没有。我什么都不做。[她提高了声音]我有权这么做！根据我国宪法第10段，“新世界的每一位居民都有权无所事事”！我知道我的权利，不怕使用它们！例如，你是否称自己为新世界的居民？}

According to paragraph 12 of our Constitution, "Every inhabitant of the New World has the right not to attend (be absent from) official meetings of inhabitants of the New World, but if this is the case, he loses all rights until attending the next meeting". So now you don't have the right to call yourself an inhabitant of the New World!}
{140}{}{明白了！根据我国《宪法》第12段，“新世界的每一位居民都有权不参加（缺席）新世界居民的正式会议，但如果是这样，他在参加下一次会议之前将失去所有权利”。所以现在你没有权利称自己为新世界的居民！}

{170}{}{[阿比林看起来非常生气]但你没有任何权利！你违反了宪法！这太离谱了！你们这些年轻人还尊重什么吗？}

{212}{018}{我只是不在乎你的宪法里写了什么。}

### {220}{}{Livos is our home, and now yours too. The vault was built a very long time ago, we all live here almost without any conflicts. Why would we, the McKinseys, quarrel with other families? We are the most important here, after all! And we are very kind, so we let the other families live with us here and do their little useless jobs.}
{220}{}{利沃斯是我们的家，现在也是你的家。金库是很久以前建的，我们都住在这里，几乎没有任何冲突。为什么我们麦金西一家会和其他家庭吵架？毕竟，我们在这里是最重要的！我们非常友善，所以我们让其他家庭和我们一起住在这里，做他们无用的小工作。}

### {230}{}{[Abilene cheers up] The McKinseys are the most powerful family in Livos! My husband Boston gives speeches at meetings, my lovely son Dallas trades water. He is such a wonderful boy! If someone tries to harm him, I'm gonna choke them with my bare hands! He is the best! Even my daughter Fox is into him. And I don't really mind, I understand her really well... But Boston is categorically against them having a relationship. What choice does Fox have, if the best man in the whole of Livos is her own brother? My husband just doesn't get it.}
{230}{}{[阿比林欢呼]麦金西一家是利沃什最有权势的家族！我丈夫波士顿在会议上发表演讲，我可爱的儿子达拉斯交易水。他真是个了不起的男孩！如果有人想伤害他，我会徒手掐死他们的！他是最棒的！就连我的女儿福克斯也喜欢他。我真的不介意，我非常理解她。。。但波士顿坚决反对他们建立关系。如果整个利沃斯的伴郎是她的亲兄弟，福克斯还有什么选择？我丈夫就是不明白。}
### {231}{024}{Tell me about the other families.}
{231}{024}{告诉我其他家庭的情况。}
### {232}{010}{Let me ask about something else.}
{232}{010}{让我问问其他的事情。}

### {240}{}{[Abilene contemptuously chuckles] What's there to say about them? A bunch of pathetic losers, that's who they are! I interact only with Emily Dunton, we play cards sometimes. She is very competitive, but she always pays her debts. Sometimes I think that if she loses her life in a game of cards, she would go as far as killing herself.}
{240}{}{[阿比林轻蔑地笑了笑]关于他们有什么好说的？一群可怜的失败者，他们就是这样！我只和艾米丽・邓顿互动，我们有时打牌。她很有竞争力，但她总是还债。有时我想，如果她在一场纸牌游戏中失去了生命，她甚至会自杀。}
