#{100}{}{You see a soldier.}
{100}{}{你看到一个士兵。}
#{101}{}{You see Jim.}
{101}{}{你看到吉姆了。}
#{102}{}{You see a soldier, one of the many. He holds some custom-made handgun in his hand.}
{102}{}{你看到一个士兵，众多士兵中的一个。他手里拿着定制的手枪。}
#{103}{}{You see that guy Jimmy.}
{103}{}{你看到那个家伙吉米了。}
#{104}{}{Fight's over. To exit the ring, you should move the barrier on the passage.}
{104}{}{战斗结束了。要退出环，你应该移动通道上的障碍物。}
#{105}{}{You ran into a fight with the bastard. Show him who's the boss!}
{105}{}{你和那个混蛋打架了。告诉他谁是老板！}
#{106}{}{*Inhospitably looks from under his eyebrows* Stop, no more...}
{106}{}{*从眉毛下冷冷地看了看，停，不要再...}
#{110}{}{[Inhospitably looks from under his eyebrows, continuing to gently clean "Desert Eagle" with a piece of rag] What do you want? If it's again about that caravaneer, you'd better be passing by. Today I can't stand the civilians especially hard.}
{110}{}{[冷冷地从眉毛下望去，继续用一块抹布轻轻地擦拭着“沙漠鹰”]你想要什么？如果又是关于那个商队的，你最好路过。今天我受不了老百姓特别辛苦。}
#{111}{}{Calm down, I AM passing by.}
{111}{}{冷静点，我路过。}
#{115}{}{Huh? You asked me?}
{115}{}{呵呵？你问我？}
#{116}{}{Calm down, I don't need you.}
{116}{}{冷静点，我不需要你。}
#{120}{}{[Inhospitably looks from under his eyebrows, continuing to gently clean "Desert Eagle" with a piece of rag] What do you want? If it's again about that caravaneer, you'd better be passing by. Today I can't stand the civilians especially hard.}

#{121}{}{And if about him - so what? Got information? The talk is there were some militaries spotted nearby.}
{121}{}{如果是关于他-那又怎样？有消息吗？据说附近发现了一些军队。}
#{122}{}{Just wanted to take a closer look on your gun. You don't see a good weapon very often these days.}
{122}{}{只是想仔细看看你的枪。现在你很少见到好武器。}
#{123}{}{And why are you so nervous? Okay, I'm leaving... Bye.}
{123}{}{你为什么这么紧张？好吧，我要走了...再见。}
#{124}{}{Yeah, it's a cool gun... Got it for honorable service. You, civilians, won't understand, what can weapon mean to a soldier! On a battlefield, individually, we are useless. But together we are walking factory of death! That's right, motherfuckers!!!}
{124}{}{是的，这是一把很酷的枪...这是为了荣誉服务。你们这些平民不会明白，武器对士兵意味着什么！在战场上，就个人而言，我们是无用的。但我们一起走的是死亡工厂！没错，混蛋！！！}
#{125}{}{An award, you say? For what services? Wasn't it for recent cleaning at the railway station? Alright, don't bother ?? I'll ask Wesker over a glass of whiskey.}
{125}{}{你说是奖励？什么服务？不是因为最近在火车站打扫卫生吗？好吧，不用麻烦了，我去叫韦斯克喝杯威士忌。}
#{126}{}{So you value that personal weapon? Can you ever remember its ID?}
{126}{}{所以你很重视那件私人武器？你记得它的身份证吗？}
#{127}{}{Then I'll leave you with *your* piece... Ahem... Anyway, bye.}
{127}{}{那我就把你的东西留给你...啊哼...不管怎样，再见。}
#{128}{}{Eh... 20... Hey, what are you sniffing here? It's my trophy, understood?! You can expect enemy assaulting us anytime - and the weapon should be in hands of someone who can use it! And this caravan moron didn't even put the safety off... Oh, fuck...}
{128}{}{呃...20... 嘿，你在嗅什么？这是我的战利品，明白吗？！你可以期待敌人随时攻击我们-武器应该在谁可以使用它的人手中！这个大篷车的白痴连保险都没关...哦，操...}
#{129}{}{So, the truth is out there, eh? Don't you want to add anything?}
{129}{}{所以，真相就在那里，嗯？你不想补充什么吗？}
#{130}{}{Interesting information... We'll talk later, a threat-of-foes-and-caravaneers.}
{130}{}{有趣的信息...我们稍后再谈，敌人和商队的威胁。}
#{131}{}{You're a little slow on understanding? I don't know anything about this caravan! Damn, I should look for a recoil spring...}
{131}{}{你理解得有点慢？我对这个大篷车一无所知！妈的，我应该找个反冲弹簧...}
#{132}{}{Caravaneer recognized you, Jimmy. And you even showed up here with a stolen gun.}
{132}{}{车夫认出你了，吉米。你甚至带着偷来的枪出现在这里。}
#{133}{}{Another question then.}
{133}{}{那又是一个问题。}
#{134}{}{Nah, everything's clear as day... So long.}
{134}{}{不，一切都很清楚...这么久。}
#{135}{}{[Looking at you from under his eyebrows glumly] Because of people like you, reds will eventually take over the States.}
{135}{}{[愁眉苦脸地看着你]因为有你这样的人，红军最终会接管美国。}
#{136}{}{What reds? Don't play riddles with me. Have nothing more to say?}
{136}{}{什么红色？别跟我玩谜语。没什么可说的了？}
#{137}{}{Think about it. I'll back.}
{137}{}{好好想想。我会回来的。}
#{138}{}{[Looking at you from under his eyebrows glumly] For my own. Not your business.}
{138}{}{[愁眉苦脸地看着你]为了我自己。不关你的事。}
#{139}{}{}
{139}{}{}
#{140}{}{[Looks from under his eyebrows, continuing to gently clean "Desert Eagle" with a piece of rag] Is there a problem, civilian ape?}
{140}{}{[从眉毛下望去，继续用一块抹布轻轻清洁“沙漠鹰”有问题吗，平民猿？}
#{141}{}{About that caravan - do you have information? The talk is there were some militaries spotted nearby.}
{141}{}{关于那辆大篷车-你有消息吗？据说附近发现了一些军队。}
#{142}{}{Just wanted to take a closer look on your gun. You don't see a good weapon very often these days.}
{142}{}{只是想仔细看看你的枪。现在你很少见到好武器。}
#{143}{}{Is there a reason for such hate burst? Okay, I'll go... Bye.}
{143}{}{这种仇恨爆发有什么原因吗？好吧，我去...再见。}
#{150}{}{What could you know about honor, you desert hobo?! If not for us, you all would have been slaves for a long time. And what kind of appreciation do we get? These wasteland hagglers rob us to skin for each delivery! So it would be fair to take what's ours, even if by force.}
{150}{}{关于荣誉你知道些什么，你这个沙漠流浪汉？！如果不是因为我们，你们早就成了奴隶了。我们得到了什么样的感激？这些荒地讨价还价者每次送货都把我们抢得血本无归！所以我们的东西就算是用武力也可以拿走。}
#{151}{}{You did the right thing, letting it slip. Now back to the point.}
{151}{}{你做了正确的事，任它溜走。现在回到正题。}
#{152}{}{You go on ?? I'll back soon.}
{152}{}{你去吧，我很快就回来。}
#{153}{}{What are you babbling about? Watch yourself - one kick to the jaw and you won't be able to speak for week.}
{153}{}{你在胡说什么？小心你自己――一踢下巴，你就一个星期都说不出话来了。}
#{154}{}{...And on top of that - unauthorized abandonment of military unit. What was with that talk about "untarnished honor of the uniform", or something?}
{154}{}{……除此之外――未经授权放弃军事单位。你说的“军装无瑕荣誉”是怎么回事？}
#{155}{}{Just like that, for everyone to see? You're not afraid of general's spies?}
{155}{}{就这样，给大家看？你不怕将军的间谍？}
#{156}{}{[Look around with open eyes] They won't turn in one of their own.}
{156}{}{[睁大眼睛环顾四周]他们不会自首的。}
#{157}{}{You say "won't turn in"? You are fighting for the restoration of the old America! Where's your honor!? Where is your conscience!?}
{157}{}{你说“不会上交”？你在为恢复旧美国而战！法官大人呢！？你的良心在哪里！？}
#{158}{}{Hm... Tough place. I think I should get out of here soon.}
{158}{}{嗯...艰苦的地方。我想我应该尽快离开这里。}
#{159}{}{}

#{160}{}{[Spits under your feet] You think, a civilian rat can press me against the wall? Don't forget which turf you're standing on!}
{160}{}{[在你脚下吐痰]你觉得，一只平民老鼠能把我按在墙上吗？别忘了你站在哪块草地上！}
#{161}{}{You can only babble while surrounded by your friends! Let's go out of the perimeter, you and me!}
{161}{}{你只能在朋友的簇拥下唠叨！我们从外围出去，你和我！}
#{162}{}{It's a good gun, for sure, but not suitable for mass battle. Maybe you could exchange it for something better?}
{162}{}{当然，这是一把好枪，但不适合大规模作战。也许你可以换个更好的？}
#{163}{}{Let's go ask Wesker? Let him explain, when he traded the territory for marauders and deserters.}
{163}{}{我们去问问韦斯克吧？让他解释一下，当他用领土换取掠夺者和逃兵的时候。}
#{164}{}{Take it easy -  I'm leaving.}
{164}{}{别紧张-我要走了。}
#{165}{}{Ha! Someone's got a death wish? Alright, I'm always ready to beat some shit out of civilians!}
{165}{}{哈！有人有遗愿？好吧，我随时准备打败平民！}
#{166}{}{Well, move your ass out of perimeter. Time to decide, who's got the match.}
{166}{}{好吧，把你的屁股移开。是时候决定谁有比赛了。}
#{167}{}{A bit later, Jimmy, later...}
{167}{}{一会儿，吉米，一会儿...}
#{169}{}{Yeah, you're right. Okay, 1000$ - and you got yourself a "Desert Eagle". [mutters to himself] Time to get rid of this junk...}
{169}{}{是的，你说得对。好吧，1000美元-你给自己买了一只“沙漠鹰”。是时候扔掉这些垃圾了...}
#{170}{}{Alright, here. And stop with the raids - the enemy doesn't sleep.}
{170}{}{好的，给你。停止突袭-敌人不睡觉。}
#{171}{}{What about some other weapon?}
{171}{}{其他武器呢？}
#{172}{}{Damn, I'm not ready to that kind of help for our glorious army.}
{172}{}{妈的，我还没准备好帮我们光荣的军队。}
#{173}{}{[Takes the money, counts them and gives the gun] Great deal. Now I can find myself something good.}
{173}{}{[拿了钱，数了数，给了枪]很多。现在我可以给自己找点好东西了。}
#{174}{}{See, there's always a peaceful solution. Take care.}
{174}{}{你看，总有和平解决的办法。当心。}
#{180}{}{Huh. What can I say? Of course! With pleasure! But I prefer rifles and submachine guns - now that is the weapons worthy of a soldier. If you find anything akin to it - I'll be glad to swap this pop gun.}
{180}{}{呵呵。我能说什么？当然！很高兴见到你！但我更喜欢步枪和冲锋枪――这才是当之无愧的武器。如果你找到类似的东西-我很乐意把这把手枪换掉。}
#{181}{}{Assault rifle - Is this what you need?}
{181}{}{突击步枪-这是你需要的吗？}
#{182}{}{Will combat shotgun suffice?}
{182}{}{战斗猎枪够了吗？}
#{183}{}{What about hunting rifle?}
{183}{}{猎枪呢？}
#{184}{}{I have... What do you say?}
{184}{}{我有...你怎么说？}

{190}{}{[你做交易，他评估新武器很长一段时间]对一个流浪者来说还不错。如果我遇到更多像你这样的人，我早就成了当地的富人了。}

{191}{}{你看，总有和平解决的办法。我们到此为止。}
#{192}{}{Ah yes... General... Hm, I wouldn't want bad relations with my boss, you know. Let's resolve this in amicable way - I'll give you the gun and you return it to that caravaneer with apologies. I shouldn't go there myself, right?}
{192}{}{啊，是的...将军...嗯，你知道，我不想和我老板关系不好。让我们友好地解决这个问题-我把枪给你，你带着歉意把枪还给那个商队。我不应该自己去那里，对吗？}
#{193}{}{Alright. Give me the gun. And don't you forget - Big Brother's watching you.}
{193}{}{好吧。把枪给我。别忘了，大哥在看着你。}
#{194}{}{You, bogey, should rather speak from the stage in Vegas, not scare people with you imaginary connections. Do you think I'll take it? Hell no!}
