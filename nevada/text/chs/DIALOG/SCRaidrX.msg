#{100}{}{You see Ripper.}

#{101}{}{You see a raider nicknamed Ripper.}
{101}{}{你看到一个绰号叫开膛手的袭击者。}
#{110}{}{Who hasn't heard the story yet? You? Alright, listen up... }
{110}{}{谁还没听过这个故事？你呢？好吧，听着。。。}
#{111}{}{We find those bastards at a bar in Reno... }
{111}{}{我们在雷诺的一家酒吧发现了那些混蛋。。。}
#{112}{}{We grab our guns, they grab their guns, we all start shit-talking like there's no tomorrow... }
{112}{}{我们抢了枪，他们抢了枪，我们开始胡说八道，好像没有明天。。。}
#{113}{}{Mexican standoff, motherfuckers. If anyone shoots, everyone's dead.}
{113}{}{墨西哥对峙，混蛋。如果有人开枪，所有人都会死。}
#{114}{}{In times like these, you gotta keep your head straight and think about every move you make.}
{114}{}{在这种时候，你必须保持头脑清醒，想想你的一举一动。}
#{115}{}{So I throw away my gun... And jump on their boss!}
{115}{}{所以我扔掉我的枪。。。跳到他们的老板身上！}
#{116}{}{I popped his eyes with my thumbs and took a bite right out of his neck!}
{116}{}{我用拇指戳破了他的眼睛，从他的脖子上咬了一口！}
#{117}{}{You should have seen them! They had faces like a brahmin's ass!}
{117}{}{你应该看看他们！他们的脸像婆罗门的屁股！}
#{118}{}{One lost his lunch right then and there. Another ran for the exit! Now that was fun! Haha!}
{118}{}{其中一个就在那丢了午餐。另一个跑向出口！那真有趣！哈哈！}
#{119}{}{What the fuck's the matter with you? You don't think it's funny? I'll repeat it for you. Maybe this time, you'll get it... }
{119}{}{你他妈的怎么了？你不觉得有趣吗？我再重复一遍。也许这次，你会明白。。。}
#{120}{}{... Hmm... Two teams, one from the east, one from the north... }
{120}{}{... 隐马尔可夫模型。。。两支队伍，一支来自东部，一支来自北部。。。}
#{121}{}{... Who made these maps?... }
{121}{}{... 这些地图是谁做的？。。。}
#{122}{}{... If we join those dealers for now... But... }
{122}{}{... 如果我们现在加入那些经销商。。。但是。。。}
#{123}{}{... Hmm... They won't be easy to take down... }
{123}{}{... 隐马尔可夫模型。。。它们不容易取下来。。。}
#{124}{}{Ivan the 1st - the king of the wasteland. Yeah... Now that's a name.}
{124}{}{伊凡一世-荒地之王。是 啊。。。这是一个名字。}
#{125}{}{It's like having bugs under my skin... Haven't killed anyone in three days already... }
{125}{}{就像皮肤下有虫子一样。。。已经三天没杀人了。。。}
#{126}{}{Too bad I didn't send Big Daddy to hell myself. I just didn't get the chance.}
{126}{}{太可惜了，我自己没把大爸爸送进地狱。我只是没有机会。}
#{200}{}{Yeah, you've got some backbone taking that job, I'll give you that. Just don't get a big head, or I'll cut it off. I've done it before! Remember that one, guys? We couldn't get his blood out for a week! Hey, why's everyone hiding their eyes? Haha!}
{200}{}{是啊，你干那工作很有骨气，我给你。别弄个大脑袋，不然我就把它砍掉。我以前做过！还记得那个吗，伙计们？我们一个星期都没能把他的血抽出来！嘿，为什么大家都把眼睛藏起来了？哈哈！}
#{201}{}{We'll see who still has their head when this is over. I think Louie would be okay with not seeing your face around here anymore.}
{201}{}{等这一切结束后，我们再看看谁还有脑袋。我想路易不会再看到你的脸了。}
#{202}{}{I've done tougher jobs. I want to ask you something.}
{202}{}{我做过更艰难的工作。我想问你一件事。}
#{203}{}{I was just leaving.}
{203}{}{我正要离开。}
#{205}{}{Oh, Louie sent me another toy! What should I do - skin you like a gecko, or beat you to death with my bare hands? Haha! Quit shaking, boy, I'm kidding... Hmm. You're not shaking at all. Interesting.}
{205}{}{哦，路易又给我寄了一个玩具！我该怎么办-像剥壁虎一样剥你的皮，还是赤手空拳把你打死？哈哈！别发抖了，孩子，我开玩笑的。。。嗯。你一点也不发抖。很有趣。}
#{206}{}{I've got nothing to shake about. I just started, and I can already tell I'm the baddest one here.}
{206}{}{我没什么好担心的。我刚开始，我已经知道我是这里最坏的。}
#{207}{}{I just need to ask you a few things.}
{207}{}{我只想问你几件事。}
#{208}{}{I should go.}
{208}{}{我该走了。}
#{209}{}{}
{209}{}{}
#{210}{}{Hey there, wanderer. Anything to say?}
{210}{}{嘿，流浪汉。有什么要说的吗？}
#{211}{}{I have questions. Do you have answers?}
{211}{}{我有问题。你有答案吗？}
#{212}{}{Not yet.}
{212}{}{还没有。}
#{213}{}{Still trying your luck, huh? Don't take it personally. I'm here to keep everyone in line, so I gotta make sure everyone knows their place. Isn't that right, assholes?}
{213}{}{还想碰碰运气吗？别当真。我是来让大家排队的，所以我要确保每个人都知道自己的位置。不是吗，混蛋？}
#{214}{}{Just make sure you know your own place. I don't need or want to listen to you.}
{214}{}{一定要知道自己的位置。我不需要也不想听你的。}
#{215}{}{That's good. Everything would fall apart without discipline. Can you answer some questions for me?}
{215}{}{那很好。没有纪律，一切都会分崩离析。你能回答我一些问题吗？}
#{216}{}{Sounds fulfilling. I'll just be on my way.}
{216}{}{听起来很满足。我马上就来。}
#{220}{}{Oh, really? [his smile vanishes and he leans in close] You may think you're hot shit, but there's people you can fuck with and people you can't. Me, you can't. Everyone does what I say in this place. EVERYONE. You try to pull shit on me, and it's going to go very fucking badly for you. You got it?}
{220}{}{哦，真的吗？[他的微笑消失了，他靠得很近]你可能认为你是个混蛋，但是有些人你可以和他们做爱，有些人你不能。我，你不能。每个人都按照我说的做。所有人。你想拉我的屎，那会对你很不利的。明白了吗？}
#{221}{}{So you're in charge, then?}
{221}{}{那你负责了？}
#{222}{}{Got it. I have another question, though.}
{222}{}{知道了。不过，我还有一个问题。}
#{223}{}{[Walk away.]}
{223}{}{[走开。]}
#{225}{}{Well, ask. This better be good, because I don't waste time on bullshit.}
{225}{}{好吧，问吧。这最好是好的，因为我不浪费时间在废话上。}
#{226}{}{I want to know more about you all.}
{226}{}{我想更多地了解你们。}
#{227}{}{Tell me about yourself.}
{227}{}{跟我说说你自己。}
#{228}{}{In that case, never mind.}
{228}{}{那样的话，没关系。}
#{230}{}{I'm going to say this once. Louie's the head here, but I'm his right hand. He may like you, but that doesn't make you invincible. You threaten my authority and I will enforce it. And for years the men will remember what happens to someone who forgets their place. Any questions?}
{230}{}{我要说一次。路易是这里的头儿，但我是他的右手。他也许喜欢你，但这并不能使你立于不败之地。你威胁我的权威，我会强制执行。多年来，这些人都会记得那些忘记自己位置的人的遭遇。有什么问题吗？}
#{231}{}{A few, actually.}
{231}{}{实际上有一些。}
#{232}{}{No, I'm good.}
{232}{}{不，我很好。}
#{240}{}{You can see for yourself! We keep the locals in line, and if any of them try shit, we organize some group funerals. I love it when they try shit, haha! I just wish the big man would have us expand, instead of just sitting around on our asses... }
{240}{}{你自己看看吧！我们让当地人排队，如果有人想拉屎，我们就组织一些集体葬礼。我喜欢他们大便，哈哈！我只希望大个子能让我们扩张，而不是坐在我们的屁股上。。。}
#{241}{}{Right. How about another question?}
{241}{}{正确的。再问一个问题怎么样？}
#{242}{}{You have an important job. Take care.}
{242}{}{你有一份重要的工作。当心。}
#{243}{}{We keep the locals on a leash. For now, that's all you need to know.}
{243}{}{我们用皮带拴住当地人。现在，你只需要知道这些。}
#{244}{}{Good enough. Another question, then.}
{244}{}{够好了。那么，另一个问题。}
#{245}{}{That's all. I'll see you around.}
{245}{}{这就是全部。回头见。}
#{250}{}{Oh, me? I grew up poor and hungry in Reno... My family didn't have much, but we had love... But just before my mother died, she told me a secret. Come closer. [he glances from side to side] Don't tell this to anyone, but my real father... Is the last president! That's why I had to escape before Chinese assassins could find me, and mix in with these scumbags.}
{250}{}{哦，我？我在里诺又穷又饿地长大。。。我的家人不多，但我们有爱。。。但就在我母亲去世之前，她告诉了我一个秘密。靠近点。别告诉任何人，但我的亲生父亲。。。是最后一任总统！这就是为什么我必须在中国刺客找到我之前逃走，和这些混蛋混在一起。}
#{251}{}{Oh, I didn't know I was in the presence of royalty! Let me guess, you were really kicked out of Reno for some petty crime, right?}
{251}{}{哦，我不知道我在皇室面前！让我猜猜，你真的因为一些小罪被踢出里诺，对吧？}
#{252}{}{Oh, well now... I have another question. Give this one a straight answer, okay?}
{252}{}{哦，现在。。。我还有一个问题。直接回答这个问题，好吗？}
#{253}{}{I'm not here for jokes. Bullshit someone else, I have more important things to do.}
{253}{}{我不是来开玩笑的。胡说别人，我还有更重要的事要做。}
#{254}{}{And who the fuck are you? You think I'm gonna hand out my life story to every dipshit that wanders down from the mountains? Prove you're someone worth talking to, and then you can ask questions.}
{254}{}{你他妈的是谁？你以为我会把我的人生故事传给每一个从山上下来的笨蛋？证明你是一个值得交谈的人，然后你可以问问题。}
#{255}{}{Let's change the subject.}
{255}{}{我们换个话题吧。}
#{256}{}{Whatever. See you around, tough guy.}
{256}{}{无论什么。回头见，硬汉。}
#{257}{}{You want to talk shit, asshole? You see these scars? I didn't get them from some hot whore in Reno, ohh no! You wouldn't last five minutes in the shithole I was born in. I had nothing! I ate dirt and drank piss to survive! And if the people there spat on me, I was lucky! But they couldn't spit on the raiders that came one day. They killed the whole village, every one of them, and took me with them because they knew I had fire in me. Those motherfuckers are lucky the raiders killed them before I got the chance! I'd have tortured them for weeks, and that's just the ones who didn't piss me off in particular! I crawled out of dirt and shit and got where I am today because I am always, ALWAYS ready to rip the fucking heart out of any unlucky cocksucker that stands in my way. And if I were in charge? I'd take these retards and make them a gang that would OWN everything between the western coast and Vegas itself!}
{257}{}{你想说废话吗，混蛋？你看到这些伤疤了吗？我不是从里诺的妓女那里弄来的，哦，不是！你在我出生的那个破地方活不了五分钟。我什么都没有！为了生存我吃了土喝了尿！如果那里的人朝我吐口水，我就走运了！但是他们不能朝有一天来的袭击者吐口水。他们杀了全村的人，把我带走，因为他们知道我身上有火。那些混蛋真走运，我还没来得及抓住机会，袭击者就杀了他们！我会折磨他们好几个星期，而那些人并没有特别惹我生气！我从泥土和大便中爬出来，走到了今天的我，因为我总是，总是准备从任何挡在我面前的倒霉蛋身上撕下他妈的心脏。如果我负责呢？我要把这些白痴变成一个拥有西海岸和维加斯之间一切的帮派！}
#{258}{}{[Listen]}
{258}{}{[听我说]}
#{259}{}{Fuck it, it's not like you even care anyway... Don't stick your nose into my past, or I'll show you everything my childhood neighbors were lucky not to experience.}
{259}{}{妈的，反正你也不在乎。。。别把你的鼻子伸进我的过去，否则我会给你看我儿时邻居幸运没有经历的一切。}
#{260}{}{Whatever you say.}
{260}{}{不管你说什么。}
#{261}{}{You earn 100 experience points for convincing the raider to tell you his dark story.}
{261}{}{说服袭击者告诉你他的黑暗故事，你将获得100点经验值。}
#{300}{}{As the locals say - how! Come in, come in. You need anything? We help our own, here.}
{300}{}{就像当地人说的-怎么！进来，进来。你需要什么吗？我们在这里帮助我们自己。}
#{301}{}{Since when are you so friendly? Don't tell me you're getting soft.}
{301}{}{你什么时候这么友好了？别告诉我你越来越软弱了。}
#{302}{}{Thank you for your kind words. Has anything happened around here?}
{302}{}{谢谢你的客气话。这附近发生什么事了吗？}
#{303}{}{It's all good. I just stopped by to say hello.}
{303}{}{一切都很好。我只是过来打个招呼。}
#{305}{}{Well, everything's quiet. I'm planning a job to keep the boys sharp, but there's a little problem... More like a distraction, really. You get it?}
{305}{}{嗯，一切都很安静。我打算找份工作让孩子们保持机敏，但有个小问题。。。更像是分散注意力，真的。你明白了吗？}
#{306}{}{Of course I do. You really can't do anything without me, huh?}
{306}{}{我当然知道。没有我你真的什么都做不了，嗯？}
#{307}{}{To be honest, I don't really care about whatever you're talking about. I have more important things to do.}
{307}{}{老实说，我不在乎你在说什么。我还有更重要的事情要做。}
#{310}{}{I like that attitude! Right to business. It's Big Louie - he's become a problem.}
{310}{}{我喜欢这种态度！营业权。是大路易-他成了问题。}
#{311}{}{Uh, how? Isn't he still in Vegas?}
{311}{}{呃，怎么了？他不是还在维加斯吗？}
#{312}{}{Stop. I don17t want to hear it.}
{312}{}{停下。我不想听。}
#{313}{}{The assholes here don't like doing real work. Some of them want to bring Louie back. I ought to bleed them out and hang up their skins as an example to the others, but I can't do that right before a big job. I'll deal with them after, but in the meantime... Even if that fucker Louie's out of the business, he's still causing me problems. He needs to be out of the picture completely.}
{313}{}{这里的混蛋不喜欢做真正的工作。有些人想把路易带回来。我应该把他们的血抽干，把他们的皮挂起来，作为其他人的榜样，但我不能在一项大工作之前就这样做。以后我会处理的，但同时。。。即使那个混蛋路易不干了，他还是给我惹麻烦。他需要完全脱离现实。}
#{314}{}{Keep talking.}
{314}{}{继续说。}
#{315}{}{I wasn't here, I didn't hear anything, you didn't say anything. Goodbye.}
{315}{}{我不在这里，我什么也没听到，你什么也没说。再见。}
#{320}{}{We didn't get along even when he was in charge, but I kept my mouth shut for the sake of the gang. Well, now the gang needs to know I'm their leader - no arguments. Louie will understand. It's just business.}
{320}{}{即使在他负责的时候，我们也相处得不好，但为了那帮人，我还是闭口不谈。好吧，现在这帮人需要知道我是他们的头目-没有争论。路易会理解的。这只是生意。}
#{321}{}{Vegas is a long trip. What do I get for doing this?}
{321}{}{维加斯是一次长途旅行。我这样做能得到什么？}
#{322}{}{I have to think about this. I'll be in touch.}
{322}{}{我得好好想想。我会联系你的。}
#{323}{}{You'll be a member in good standing... Really? Nothing? Fine, I'll pay cash. My word is bond, don't you worry about that.}
{323}{}{你将是一个信誉良好的会员。。。真正地？没有什么？好吧，我付现金。我保证邦德，你不用担心。}
#{324}{}{Deal. Consider him dead.}
{324}{}{处理。就当他死了。}
#{325}{}{Maybe. I'll think about it. See you later.}
{325}{}{也许 吧。我会考虑的。再见。}
#{350}{}{You better have good news. People who bring me bad news get fed to the dogs.}
{350}{}{你最好有好消息。给我带来坏消息的人会被喂狗。}
#{351}{}{Big Louie made me a better offer. You understand. It's just business.}
{351}{}{大路易给了我一个更好的条件。你明白的。这只是生意。}
#{352}{}{Big Louie's playing jazz for the devil in hell. Time to pay.}
{352}{}{大路易在地狱为魔鬼演奏爵士乐。是时候付钱了。}
#{353}{}{Nothing right now.}
{353}{}{现在什么都没有。}
#{354}{}{Yes, I heard. News like this travels fast. Great job, brother - here's your reward. Now, I've got to think about my next move. I'll see around.}
{354}{}{是的，我听说了。像这样的消息传得很快。干得好，兄弟-这是你的奖赏。现在，我得考虑下一步行动了。我走着瞧。}
#{355}{}{That's it?! Not good, brother - this wasn't some Reno junkie. Big Louie's worth a lot more than that!}
{355}{}{就这样？！不好，兄弟-这不是雷诺的瘾君子。大路易的价值远不止这些！}
#{356}{}{Good luck.}
{356}{}{祝你好运。}
#{357}{}{You're right. For work like this, I can give you another }
{357}{}{你说得对。对于这样的工作，我可以再给你一份}
#{358}{}{ bucks, but don17t get greedy.}
{358}{}{但是不要贪心。}
#{359}{}{Now we're talking!}
{359}{}{现在我们在说话！}
#{360}{}{Uh-huh... I get it. I get it. But we're not a bank, damn it. Here, the guys brought me this from the last raid. It's yours.}
{360}{}{啊哈。。。我明白了。我明白了。但我们不是银行，该死。这是上次突袭的人给我的。这是你的。}
#{361}{}{That's the best you can do? Thanks, I guess.}
{361}{}{你就只能这样了？谢谢，我想。}
#{1202}{}{I've done tougher jobs. I want to ask you something.}
{1202}{}{我做过更艰难的工作。我想问你一件事。}
#{1205}{}{Oh, Louie sent me another bitch! Decisions, decisions - do I choke you to death before, after, or while I fuck every one of your holes? Haha! Quit shaking, girl, I'm kidding... Hmm. You're not shaking at all. Interesting.}
{1205}{}{哦，路易又派了一个婊子来！决定，决定-我是在我操你的每一个洞之前，之后，还是在我操你的每一个洞的时候掐死你？哈哈！别发抖了，女孩，我开玩笑的。。。嗯。你一点也不发抖。很有趣。}
#{1208}{}{I should go.}
