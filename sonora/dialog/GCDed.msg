### {200}{}{Wait, don't get too close! Everyone here knows better than to mess with you.}
{200}{}{等等，不要靠得太近！这里的每个人都知道不要惹你。}
### {201}{}{And they are right. So shut your mouth, old man.}
{201}{}{他们是对的。所以闭上你的嘴，老人。}
### {202}{}{Okay, okay, but know that I'm still able to stand up for myself.}
{202}{}{好吧，好吧，但要知道我仍然能够为自己挺身而出。}

{206}{}{这些威胁是不必要的。让我们谈谈吧。}
### {207}{}{Ah, this is our new celebrity. To what do I owe?}
{207}{}{啊，这是我们的新名人。我欠什么？}
### {208}{}{What can an old man like you offer me?}
{208}{}{像你这样的老人能给我什么？}
### {209}{}{Well, nothing, probably. Why would I offer you something?}
{209}{}{嗯，可能什么都没有。我为什么要给你一些东西？}
### {210}{}{Then just talk.}

### {212}{}{I'm looking at you and I think we should get to know each other.}
{212}{}{我看着你，我想我们应该互相了解一下。}
### {213}{}{Usually people don't impose themselves just like that. But for some reason I believe you.}
{213}{}{通常人们不会那样强加自己。但出于某种原因，我相信你。}
### {214}{}{Just wonderful. Shall we talk?}
{214}{}{太棒了。我们谈谈好吗？}
### {215}{}{You're right, you shouldn't force yourself on a conversation with a beggar like you. Be.}
{215}{}{你说得对，你不应该强迫自己和你这样的乞丐谈话。是}
### {216}{}{What do you want? If it's an iguana, I won't give it to you. I have nothing to eat myself.}
{216}{}{你想要什么？如果是鬣蜥，我不会给你。我自己没有东西吃。}
### {217}{}{Come on, I'm not going to rip it out of your mouth.}
{217}{}{拜托，我不会把它从你嘴里扯下来的。}
### {218}{}{That's good. And then you'll be left without a hand. What do you want?}
{218}{}{这很好。然后你将失去一只手。你想要什么？}
### {219}{}{Just to talk.}
{219}{}{只是说说而已。}
### {220}{}{Looking at you, I understand that nothing.}
{220}{}{看着你，我什么都不明白。}
### {221}{}{Come on, give me an iguana! Now!}
{221}{}{来吧，给我一只鬣蜥！现在}
### {222}{}{Yes on! Take it! And there's nothing to wave your arms around here. And where do you come from in such a wilderness...}
{222}{}{是的！拿着！这里没有什么可以挥动你的手臂的。在这样的荒野中，你从哪里来。。。}
### {223}{}{I'm not done with you yet. I need answers to questions.}
{223}{}{我对你还没完。我需要问题的答案。}
### {1223}{}{I'm not done with you yet. I need answers to questions.}
{1223}{}{我对你还没完。我需要问题的答案。}
### {224}{}{That's enough for now. But I'll be back.}
{224}{}{现在已经足够了。但我会回来的。}
### {225}{}{Hands off! This is my prey! If you need a lizard, go and catch it in the desert.}
{225}{}{把手放开！这是我的猎物！如果你需要一只蜥蜴，就去沙漠里抓吧。}
### {226}{}{Don't be angry, old man. It's just a joke.}
{226}{}{别生气，老头。这只是个玩笑。}
### {227}{}{I'll do that. Anyway, I don't want to communicate with such a greedy person anymore.}
{227}{}{我会那样做的。不管怎样，我不想再和这样一个贪婪的人交流了。}
### {228}{}{I have no evil intentions. Here, take the cap as a sign of my honesty.}

### {239}{}{Well, there's nothing to pull an iguana by the tail. Tell me straight out, what do you want?}
{239}{}{没有什么可以拉鬣蜥的尾巴。直截了当地告诉我，你想要什么？}
### {240}{}{Who are you?}
{240}{}{你是谁？}
### {241}{}{My name is Carmelo. I just live here.}
{241}{}{我的名字叫卡梅罗。我只是住在这里。}
### {242}{}{Have you lost your memory? My name is Carmelo.}
{242}{}{你失忆了吗？我的名字叫卡梅罗。}
### {243}{}{Actually, I want to ask something else.}
{243}{}{事实上，我想问别的问题。}
### {244}{}{Goodbye, old Carmelo.}
{244}{}{再见，老卡梅罗。}
### {245}{}{What are you doing here?}
{245}{}{你在这里干什么？}
### {246}{}{I catch lizards and sell them to the rest of the residents. And it's not so easy to catch them.}
{246}{}{我抓蜥蜴卖给其他居民。而且要抓住他们并不那么容易。}
### {247}{}{Did you also work as a garbage man?}
{247}{}{你也做过垃圾工吗？}
### {248}{}{Yes. I had a great nose for useful things. After all, even a handful of garbage can be used. (sigh) But the mine has become impoverished, now I'm looking for lizards instead of old utensils.}
{248}{}{对我对有用的东西有敏锐的嗅觉。毕竟，即使是一把垃圾也可以使用。（叹气）但是矿井已经很穷了，现在我要找蜥蜴而不是旧器具。}
### {249}{}{I see. Actually, I want to ask something else.}
{249}{}{我明白了。事实上，我想问别的问题。}
### {250}{}{I gotta go, man. See you again.}
{250}{}{我得走了，伙计，再见。}
### {251}{}{Did you work as a garbage man?}
{251}{}{你做过垃圾工吗？}
### {252}{}{Why are you so distrustful, old Carmelo?}
{252}{}{你为什么这么不信任，老卡梅罗？}
### {253}{}{Live here as long as I have lived, you will also become distrustful.}
{253}{}{我在这里住了多久，你也会变得不信任。}
### {254}{}{Are you always so distrustful?}
{254}{}{你总是那么不信任吗？}
### {255}{}{Remind me, what are you doing here?}
{255}{}{提醒我，你在这里干什么？}
### {256}{}{Did you also work at the mine?}
{256}{}{你也在矿场工作吗？}
### {257}{}{Indeed, you don't often meet an elder in these places.}
{257}{}{事实上，在这些地方你并不经常遇到长辈。}
### {258}{}{They say they used to live up to a hundred, but now rare lucky people manage to reach my age. It probably saved me that I didn't get into all sorts of scrapes.}
{258}{}{他们说他们过去能活到一百岁，但现在很少有幸运儿能活到我这个年纪。这可能救了我，因为我没有陷入各种困境。}
### {259}{}{By the way, what are you doing here?}
{259}{}{顺便问一下，你在这里干什么？}

### {260}{}{Seriously? I just had some garbage in my pocket. Take a look...}
{260}{}{认真地我只是口袋里有一些垃圾。看看。。。}
### {261}{}{Well ... (with interest sorting through the trash from your pocket) If I had such pockets, I would have gotten rich a long time ago.}
{261}{}{好（饶有兴趣地整理你口袋里的垃圾）如果我有这样的口袋，我早就发财了。}
### {262}{}{Is there something useful here?}
{262}{}{这里有什么有用的东西吗？}
### {263}{}{Look, there's a pre-war bill here, a couple of caps, and a small-caliber cartridge. At best, you can buy an iguana for all this. But it's better than nothing, right?}
{263}{}{看，这里有一张战前的钞票，几顶帽子，还有一个小口径的子弹。充其量，你可以花这么多钱买一只鬣蜥。但总比什么都没有好，对吧？}
### {264}{}{Ugh, I really thought this garbage wouldn't be of any use.}
{264}{}{啊，我真的以为这些垃圾没什么用。}
### {265}{}{So I still have everything ahead of me. I'm going to look for an investor.}
{265}{}{所以我还有一切要做。我要找一个投资者。}

### {266}{}{Hey, old man, do you know anyone with a welding machine?}
{266}{}{嘿，老头，你认识谁有焊机吗？}
### {267}{}{There's definitely one in the garage. Frank also owned the machine, but he's still a miser. Oh, yeah, I smelled welding from Todd's cabin recently. Maybe I just imagined it, but ask him just in case.}
{267}{}{车库里肯定有一个。弗兰克也拥有这台机器，但他仍然是个吝啬鬼。哦，是的，我最近从托德的小屋里闻到了焊接的味道。也许我只是想象，但问问他以防万一。}
### {268}{}{Thank you.}
{268}{}{非常感谢。}
### {269}{}{You can't do much without welding. Therefore, Mr. Kogan once outbid most welding machines. There weren't enough of them already.}
{269}{}{没有焊接你做不了什么。因此，Kogan先生曾经出价超过大多数焊机。他们已经不够了。}

### {270}{}{Tell me, did a slave convoy pass through here?}
{270}{}{告诉我，有奴隶车队经过这里吗？}
### {271}{}{Yes, there were such. But then I went to the wastelands so as not to cross paths with such dangerous people.}
{271}{}{是的，确实有。但后来我去了荒原，以免与这样危险的人擦肩而过。}
### {272}{}{Do you know where the convoy went?}
{272}{}{你知道车队去了哪里吗？}
### {273}{}{Somewhere to the east. I haven't been to those parts.}
{273}{}{在东边的某个地方。我没去过那些地方。}
### {274}{}{Thank you. But I still have questions.}
{274}{}{非常感谢。但我仍然有疑问。}
### {275}{}{That's it, I'm already going in that direction. Bye.}
{275}{}{就是这样，我已经朝着那个方向走了。再见}
### {276}{}{After the question about slaves, this raises suspicions.}
{276}{}{在关于奴隶的问题之后，这引起了怀疑。}

### {280}{}{Tell me about this mine.}
{280}{}{告诉我我的这个。}
### {281}{}{What's there to tell? No one used to live in these parts. And when the cartel opened, crowds of scavengers came here.}
{281}{}{有什么好说的？以前没有人住在这些地方。当卡特尔开张时，成群的拾荒者来到了这里。}
### {282}{}{I have no more questions about the mine.}
{282}{}{我对矿井没有更多的疑问了。}
### {283}{}{I think I should go.}
{283}{}{我想我应该走了。}
### {284}{}{What is the cartel doing?}
{284}{}{卡特尔在干什么？}
### {285}{}{Buys finds from scavengers, then repairs and takes them to auction in other cities.}
{285}{}{从拾荒者那里购买发现的东西，然后进行修复，并将其带到其他城市拍卖。}
### {286}{}{Who are the scavengers?}
{286}{}{拾荒者是谁？}
### {287}{}{scavengers, looters, call it what you want. They mine useful things in the ruins and carry them to the garage for recycling.}
{287}{}{拾荒者，抢劫者，随你怎么说。他们在废墟中挖掘有用的东西，然后把它们运到车库里回收。}
### {288}{}{Does this job attract people?}
{288}{}{这份工作吸引人吗？}
### {289}{}{Of course! Many come here hoping to earn a mountain of caps and go to more trustworthy settlements. But more often this stop turns out to be the last for them.}
{289}{}{当然许多人来到这里，希望赚一大笔钱，去更值得信赖的定居点。但更多的时候，这一站对他们来说是最后一站。}
### {290}{}{You say that like the end of the city has come.}
{290}{}{你说这就像城市的末日已经来临。}
### {291}{}{It hasn't come yet. But there's not much left. The resources in the ruins are depleted, and people have nothing else to earn. Therefore, the city is dying out. And it will die out if someone doesn't come up with something.}
{291}{}{它还没有来。但是已经所剩无几了。废墟中的资源已经耗尽，人们没有其他收入。因此，这座城市正在消亡。如果有人不想出什么办法，它就会消亡。}
### {292}{}{Nothing will help this dump for sure.}
{292}{}{没有什么能帮助这个垃圾场。}
### {293}{}{A sad story. Let's change the subject?}
{293}{}{一个悲伤的故事。我们换个话题吧？}
### {294}{}{Is there really nothing we can do?}
{294}{}{我们真的无能为力吗？}
### {295}{}{Well, if the garage still decides to restore the old factory, then it can save the settlement and give jobs. But something I hardly believe in it.}
{295}{}{好吧，如果车库仍然决定恢复旧工厂，那么它可以节省定居点并提供就业机会。但我很难相信这一点。}
### {296}{}{What's the story with the plant?}
{296}{}{这株植物是怎么回事？}
### {297}{}{It's a crazy idea to restore an old factory. Such an enterprise needs a lot of energy and a lot of workers. And what is even more important - knowledge that no one has now. People can only hope for a miracle.}
{297}{}{修复一个旧工厂是个疯狂的主意。这样的企业需要大量的精力和大量的工人。更重要的是――现在没有人拥有的知识。人们只能寄希望于奇迹。}
### {298}{}{Who needs all this old industry? We do without her at the Villa, with our own hands.}
{298}{}{谁需要这些老工业？我们在别墅里没有她，只有我们自己的双手。}
### {299}{}{Believe me, there are places in the south that are waiting for all these pre-war wonders. You can't do much with your hands alone.}
{299}{}{相信我，在南方有些地方正在等待着所有这些战前的奇迹。你一个人用手做不了多少事。}

### {300}{}{If no one lived here before, then where did these ruins come from?}
{300}{}{如果以前没有人住在这里，那么这些废墟是从哪里来的呢？}
### {301}{}{Earlier - this is before the arrival of the cartel. Don't twist the words. Of course, before the War there was a whole town called Kingman. But that was almost a hundred years ago.}
{301}{}{早些时候――这是在卡特尔到来之前。不要曲解文字。当然，战前有一个叫金曼的小镇。但那几乎是一百年前的事了。}
### {302}{}{What are you talking about? Is there a war going on somewhere?}
{302}{}{你在说什么？某个地方正在打仗吗？}
### {303}{}{Don't you know? It's an old story. There are many legends about her. They say that a hundred years ago there were large states that could not get along and divide the remnants of "garbage". Just like now in our Garage City.}
{303}{}{你不知道吗？这是一个古老的故事。关于她有许多传说。他们说，一百年前，有一些大州无法相处，无法分割“垃圾”的残余。就像现在在我们的车库城一样。}
### {304}{}{So they destroyed each other?}
{304}{}{所以他们互相毁灭了？}
### {305}{}{They came up with a very formidable weapon that wiped entire cities off the face of the earth. Few survived. And we are their descendants. Already five or six generations have changed since then.}
{305}{}{他们发明了一种非常强大的武器，将整个城市从地球上抹去。很少有人幸存下来。我们是他们的后代。从那时起，已经有五六代人发生了变化。}
### {306}{}{There can't be such a powerful weapon. It's all stories!}
{306}{}{不可能有这么强大的武器。都是故事！}
### {307}{}{Here you will visit the cities in the south and see with your own eyes. Although why am I arguing with you - I've heard these stories in retellings myself.}
{307}{}{在这里，你将参观南方的城市，亲眼目睹。尽管我为什么要和你争论――我自己也在复述中听到过这些故事。}
### {308}{}{Exactly. Leave your horror stories to the kids by the fireplace.}
{308}{}{确切地把你的恐怖故事留给壁炉旁的孩子们听。}
### {309}{}{Surely there is some truth in this sad story.}
{309}{}{这个悲伤的故事肯定是有道理的。}
### {310}{}{And you have a chatty tongue. It's not good.}
{310}{}{你的舌头很健谈。这不好。}

### {320}{}{Tell me about catching iguanas.}
{320}{}{告诉我抓鬣蜥的事。}
### {321}{}{An iguana? Desert lizard. Catching them is still a concern. But there is no better snack for any swill in the world. Do you want a piece? I won't give it for free.}
{321}{}{鬣蜥？沙漠蜥蜴。捕捉它们仍然是一个令人担忧的问题。但是，世界上没有比这更好的零食了。你想要一块吗？我不会免费给的。}
### {322}{}{Enough about lizards. My stomach is already rumbling.}
{322}{}{蜥蜴已经够多了。我的肚子已经咕咕叫了。}
### {323}{}{That's great. Otherwise, if everyone around starts catching lizards, then I will have nothing left.}
{323}{}{太好了。否则，如果周围的人都开始抓蜥蜴，那么我就什么都没有了。}
### {324}{}{Is there really no other food here?}
{324}{}{这里真的没有其他食物吗？}
### {325}{}{So where does it come from? There are desert and mountains all around. Previously, the products were brought by traders from the south. But lately there are fewer and fewer caravans, and the products are getting dirtier. We have to catch lizards, at least some food.}
{325}{}{那么它是从哪里来的呢？四周都是沙漠和山脉。此前，这些产品是由南方贸易商带来的。但最近大篷车越来越少，产品也越来越脏。我们必须抓蜥蜴，至少要抓一些食物。}
### {326}{}{What about coyotes and scorpions?}
{326}{}{郊狼和蝎子呢？}
### {327}{}{Things are more dangerous with them. A coyote can bite off a leg. And scorpions are poisonous, and there is less meat in them.}
{327}{}{有了它们，情况就更危险了。郊狼能咬掉一条腿。蝎子是有毒的，而且里面的肉很少。}
### {328}{}{Have you tried growing crops?}
{328}{}{你试过种庄稼吗？}
### {329}{}{Where, here? Apart from dry grass and mold, nothing grows here in the old basements. There is a hydroponic farm nearby, but this one will feed only a few people.}
{329}{}{在哪里，在这里？除了干草和霉菌，这里的旧地下室里什么也长不出来。附近有一个水培农场，但这个农场只能养活少数人。}
### {330}{}{How do you catch them?}
{330}{}{你是怎么抓住它们的？}
### {331}{}{Don't expect me to tell you. I don't need competitors here.}
{331}{}{别指望我告诉你。我这里不需要竞争对手。}
### {332}{}{I wonder where you got such questions from? As if you know how to grow maize in the desert.}
{332}{}{我想知道你从哪里得到这样的问题？就好像你知道如何在沙漠中种植玉米一样。}
### {333}{}{Come on, old man, everyone here is their own.}
{333}{}{来吧，老人，这里的每个人都是自己的。}
### {334}{}{Good people should share their experience.}
{334}{}{好人应该分享他们的经验。}
### {335}{}{And if I pay 25 caps?}
{335}{}{如果我支付25个上限？}
### {336}{}{I doubt you have any. Probably robbed someone or took it off a corpse. And I don't need that.}
{336}{}{我怀疑你有没有。可能是抢劫了人或者从尸体上拿走的。我不需要。}
### {337}{}{Well, well.}
{337}{}{嗯，嗯。}
### {338}{}{Earn your trust first, then we'll talk.}
{338}{}{先赢得您的信任，然后我们再谈。}
### {339}{}{Are you trying to humiliate me now, an old man in rags?}
{339}{}{你现在是想羞辱我吗，一个破衣烂衫的老人？}
### {340}{}{I didn't allow myself to be rude.}
{340}{}{我不允许自己无礼。}
### {341}{}{Of course, no problem.}
{341}{}{当然，没问题。}
### {342}{}{And if I pay?}
{342}{}{如果我付钱呢？}
### {343}{}{How will you pay? caps? Now there is nothing to buy with them in this city.}
{343}{}{你将如何付款？帽子？现在这个城市没有什么可买的了。}
### {344}{}{Well, if you think about it, the bottlecaps are back in business after all these events at the Factory. Give me 50 caps.}
{344}{}{好吧，如果你仔细想想，在工厂发生了所有这些事件之后，装瓶厂又开始营业了。给我50顶帽子。}
### {345}{}{You're not going to keep deceiving me, are you?}
{345}{}{你不会一直欺骗我吧？}
### {346}{}{Hmm... Agreed. But first, fulfill one of my little requests.}
{346}{}{嗯…同意。但首先，满足我的一个小要求。}
### {347}{}{Just tell me how you catch lizards.}
{347}{}{告诉我你是怎么抓蜥蜴的。}
### {348}{}{No, that won't do.}
{348}{}{不，那不行。}
### {349}{}{Which one?}
{349}{}{哪一个？}
### {350}{}{So what do you want?}
{350}{}{那你想要什么？}
### {351}{}{Mushrooms. Those strange green mushrooms that grow in toxic puddles near the Plant. Bring some, and then I'll tell you about my trapper tricks.}
{351}{}{蘑菇。那些奇怪的绿色蘑菇生长在工厂附近的有毒水坑里。带一些来，然后我会告诉你我的陷阱技巧。}
### {352}{}{Okay, I'll try to get it.}
{352}{}{好吧，我会试着去拿。}
### {353}{}{That's good. Come on, move.}
{353}{}{这很好。来吧，动起来。}
### {354}{}{Mushrooms from toxic puddles? What for?}
{354}{}{有毒水坑里的蘑菇？为何}
### {355}{}{That's my business. Just get it and bring it.}
{355}{}{这是我的事。把它拿过来。}
### {356}{}{Agreed. But don't try to deceive me, old man.}
{356}{}{同意。但别想骗我，老头子。}
### {357}{}{No problem.}
{357}{}{没问题。}
### {358}{}{If you catch a parish from them, then it's really not my problem. See you later.}
{358}{}{如果你从他们那里抓到一个教区，那真的不是我的问题。回头见。}

### {360}{}{Share your wisdom, how do I get these damn mushrooms?}
{360}{}{分享你的智慧，我怎么才能得到这些该死的蘑菇？}
### {361}{}{Toxic puddles are burning, you need tight shoes. Rubber boots will do, but they won't last long.}
{361}{}{有毒的水坑在燃烧，你需要穿紧身的鞋子。橡胶靴可以，但用不了多久。}
### {362}{}{Clear.}
{362}{}{清楚的}
### {363}{}{Why don't you climb into this sewer yourself?}
{363}{}{你为什么不自己爬进下水道？}
### {364}{}{Because I have you.}
{364}{}{因为我有你。}
### {365}{}{Don't worry. Grab the mushrooms and run back.}
{365}{}{别担心。抓着蘑菇跑回去。}
### {366}{}{And that's it? Not enough. Bring more.}
{366}{}{就这样？还不够。带来更多。}
### {367}{}{It's starting to make me nervous.}
{367}{}{这开始让我紧张了。}
### {368}{}{Okay, no problem.}
{368}{}{好吧，没问题。}

### {370}{}{Here are your mushrooms. I hope you know what you're doing.}
{370}{}{这是你的蘑菇。我希望你知道你在做什么。}
### {371}{}{I can smell these mushrooms a mile away.}
{371}{}{我能在一英里外闻到这些蘑菇的味道。}
### {372}{}{But where are they? We were here...}
{372}{}{但是他们在哪里？我们在这里。。。}
### {373}{}{Oh, yes, that's enough for me for a long time.}
{373}{}{哦，是的，这对我来说已经足够长时间了。}
### {374}{}{So how do you catch iguanas?}
{374}{}{那么你是如何捕捉鬣蜥的呢？}
### {375}{}{That's how I catch.}
{375}{}{我就是这样抓住的。}
### {376}{}{Eh, for mushrooms?}
{376}{}{呃，蘑菇？}
### {377}{}{Not quite. These mushrooms attract some insects, and already insects attract lizards. Few people know about this trick.}
{377}{}{不完全是。这些蘑菇吸引了一些昆虫，而昆虫已经吸引了蜥蜴。很少有人知道这个把戏。}
### {378}{}{That's it! And you know a lot.}
{378}{}{就是这样！你知道很多。}
### {379}{}{A curious scheme. Surely not the only one in your craft.}
{379}{}{一个奇怪的计划。肯定不是你工艺中唯一的一个。}
### {380}{}{Sure. But tell me, what exactly are you going to do?}
{380}{}{当然但告诉我，你到底要做什么？}
### {381}{}{Tell us about iguanas, their habits, habitats. [Survival +3]}

### {384}{}{Then listen carefully, I won't repeat it twice.}
{384}{}{然后仔细听，我不会重复两次。}
### {385}{}{Speak up, old man. I want to absorb all your experience...}
{385}{}{说出来吧，老人。我想吸收你所有的经验。。。}
