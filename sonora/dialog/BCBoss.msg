{201}{}{我的村庄被奴役了。你知道吗？}
### {202}{}{Twilight covered Sonora from the eyes of the Divine Brahmin. Slavers are everywhere now. They use our brothers in mines, logging, and settlement construction. I don't know where exactly your tribesmen are. But you'll probably find out in Phoenix.}
{202}{}{黄昏笼罩着神圣婆罗门眼中的索诺拉。现在到处都是奴隶。他们在矿山、伐木和定居点建设中使用我们的兄弟。我不知道你们部落的人到底在哪里。但你可能会在凤凰城发现。}
### {203}{}{Thank you. I will search further.}

### {210}{}{What are you going to do?}
{210}{}{你打算怎么办？}
### {211}{}{I want to form an alliance with the Rangers. This decision was not easy, but we need an ally to defend our freedom. After all, our enemies have guns and metal armor. And we have only brahmins and sticks.}
{211}{}{我想和游骑兵队结盟。这个决定并不容易，但我们需要一个盟友来捍卫我们的自由。毕竟，我们的敌人有枪和金属盔甲。我们只有婆罗门和棍子。}

{212}{}{面对共同的威胁，我们必须互相帮助。我能做什么？}
### {213}{}{Villa should also stand on our side and on the side of the Rangers. This is a common cause. Find Ranger Oscar, he helps us in the fight against the missionaries. Perhaps your help will be useful to him.}
{213}{}{维拉也应该站在我们这边，站在流浪者这边。这是一个共同的原因。找到游骑兵奥斯卡，他帮助我们对抗传教士。也许你的帮助对他有用。}

#Main Quest
### {240}{}{I ask you to break your alliance with the Rangers and form an alliance with the Phoenix missionaries.}
{240}{}{我请求你打破与游骑兵队的联盟，与凤凰城传教士结盟。}
### {241}{}{Hmm. You're too brave for a peasant, that's for sure. But why should I agree?}
{241}{}{对农民来说你太勇敢了，这是肯定的。但我为什么要同意呢？}
### {1241}{}{Hmm-m. You're too brave for a peasant, that's for sure. But why should I agree?}
{1241}{}{嗯。你对农民来说太勇敢了，这是肯定的。但我为什么要同意呢？}
### {242}{}{Hmm. Judging by the rumors that come from the West, I doubt that this alliance was a good idea. But will the new union be better?}
{242}{}{嗯。从来自西方的传言来看，我怀疑这个联盟是个好主意。但新联盟会更好吗？}
### {243}{}{The Rangers are just using you to fight the Phoenix Empire. They don't care about your tribe.}
{243}{}{游骑兵只是利用你来对抗凤凰帝国。他们不关心你的部落。}
### {244}{}{You're saying serious things. But these are just the words of a peasant against the words of an entire army of rangers.}
{244}{}{你说的是严肃的话。但这些只是一个农民的话，而不是整个护林员的话。}
### {1244}{}{You're saying serious things. But these are just the words of a peasant woman against the words of an entire army of rangers.}
{1244}{}{你说的是严肃的话。但这些只是一个农民妇女的话，反对整个护林员的话。}
### {245}{}{When it's too late, you'll remember my words.}
{245}{}{为时已晚时，你会记住我的话。}
### {246}{}{But even if the truth is behind you, I can't make that decision alone. The other shamans still share my point of view. I won't change it until they change theirs.}
{246}{}{但即使真相已经过去，我也不能独自做出这个决定。其他萨满仍然赞同我的观点。我不会改变，除非他们改变他们的。}
### {247}{}{Then I should talk to the other chiefs. See you later, Geronimo.}
{247}{}{那我应该和其他首领谈谈。回头见，杰罗尼莫。}
### {248}{}{The Phoenix Empire will wipe you off the face of the earth if it doesn't subdue you. Do you want such an inglorious end?}
{248}{}{如果凤凰帝国不制服你，它就会把你从地球上抹去。你想要这样一个不光彩的结局吗？}
### {249}{}{To find peace in the battle for your freedom is the glorious end. I'd rather die than join the empire.}
{249}{}{在争取自由的战斗中找到和平是光荣的结局。我宁死也不愿加入帝国。}
### {250}{}{So you're a fool. And someday you will regret your decision.}
{250}{}{所以你是个傻瓜。总有一天你会后悔你的决定。}
### {251}{}{I understand. Sorry for my words, Chief.}
{251}{}{我理解。抱歉，警长。}
### {252}{}{You have united the tribe, great leader. It's up to you to decide what to do next. But by making an alliance with the Rangers, you doom the tribe to an endless war.}
{252}{}{你团结了部落，伟大的领袖。下一步该做什么由你决定。但如果你与游骑兵结盟，你就会让部落陷入无休止的战争。}
### {253}{}{Perhaps the truth is yours. The Phoenix Empire is strong and great. We will not be able to resist and someday we will give up. If we join the empire, we will retain some independence.}
{253}{}{也许真相是你的。凤凰帝国强大而伟大。我们将无法抵抗，总有一天我们会放弃。如果我们加入帝国，我们将保持一定的独立性。}
### {254}{}{Do you agree?}
{254}{}{你同意吗？}
### {255}{}{Apparently, I should listen to your words. Although the Rangers won't like it. Don't make me regret this decision.}
{255}{}{显然，我应该听听你的话。虽然流浪者队不会喜欢的。不要让我后悔这个决定。}
### {256}{}{Thank you. I will convey your words to the commander of the missionaries.}
{256}{}{非常感谢。我将把你的话转达给传教士的指挥官。}
### {257}{}{All my advisors say the same thing. An alliance with the Rangers promises only a bloody war. And the union with the Phoenix grants peace, but takes away freedom.}
{257}{}{我所有的顾问都说同样的话。与游骑兵队结盟只会带来一场血腥的战争。与凤凰城的结合给予了和平，却剥夺了自由。}
### {258}{}{You know that the lives of fellow tribesmen are more important.}
{258}{}{你知道部落同胞的生命更重要。}
### {259}{}{Some of my advisers have left this world, and the other has turned against me. An alliance with the Rangers promises only a bloody war. And an alliance with the Phoenix grants peace, but takes away freedom. In the struggle between the eagle and the snake, it remains only to hide your head in the sand.}
{259}{}{我的一些顾问已经离开了这个世界，而另一个则转而反对我。与流浪者队结盟只会带来一场血腥的战争。与凤凰城结盟可以带来和平，但却剥夺了自由。在鹰和蛇之间的斗争中，它只会把你的头藏在沙子里。}

### {260}{}{The missionaries have left your lands. Ranger Oscar and I made them leave.}
{260}{}{传教士已经离开了你们的土地。游骑兵奥斯卡和我让他们离开。}
### {261}{}{The missionaries have left your lands. I managed to get them to leave.}
{261}{}{传教士已经离开了你们的土地。我设法让他们离开。}
### {262}{}{Good news for the whole tribe. We have once again proved our independence and defended our freedom. Of course, the fight will not end, and for a while we will be disturbed by pale-faced aliens from Phoenix and Ranger scouts. But we will outlive them too.}
{262}{}{对整个部落来说是个好消息。我们再次证明了我们的独立性，捍卫了我们的自由。当然，这场战斗不会结束，在一段时间内，我们会被来自凤凰城和游骑兵侦察兵的脸色苍白的外星人打扰。但我们也会比他们活得更长。}
### {263}{}{[Listen]}
{263}{}{[听]}
### {264}{}{It's as if the Divine Brahmin himself sent you to us in a difficult hour! Thank you. You can stay in the camp as long as you want. I will tell everyone about your exploits so that anyone can share Vault and food with you.}
{264}{}{就好像神圣的婆罗门自己在困难的时刻把你送到了我们这里！非常感谢。你想在营地呆多久就呆多久。我会告诉每个人你的功绩，这样任何人都可以和你分享金库和食物。}
### {265}{}{Thank you.}
{265}{}{非常感谢。}
### {266}{}{I hope your search for the missing family will be even more successful. By the way, our scouts reported that a group of slaves from the Villa was seen on the way to Flagstaff. Look there.}
{266}{}{我希望你对失踪家庭的搜寻会更加成功。顺便说一句，我们的侦察兵报告说，在去弗拉格斯塔夫的路上看到了一群来自别墅的奴隶。看那里。}
### {267}{}{Thank you, Chief.}
{267}{}{谢谢局长。}

### {270}{}{I ask you to reopen the caravan route to Garage City.}
{270}{}{我请求你重新开通去车库城的商队路线。}
### {271}{}{All roads and trade routes with the Phoenix colonies are closed. So the council of elders decided.}
{271}{}{与菲尼克斯殖民地的所有道路和贸易路线都被关闭了。于是长老会决定。}
### {272}{}{Apparently, you won't change your mind until your relationship with Phoenix is better.}
{272}{}{显然，在你和菲尼克斯的关系好转之前，你不会改变主意。}
### {273}{}{We have already opened caravan routes with Phoenix. Let all his colonies return to peaceful trade.}
{273}{}{我们已经开通了与凤凰城的商队路线。让他的所有殖民地恢复和平贸易。}
### {274}{}{Great. }
{274}{}{太棒了}
### {275}{}{Garage City also suffered from Aaron's empire. But now the Cathedral of Fire is destroyed, Aaron is dead. Phoenix is no longer a threat to you.}
{275}{}{车库城也受到了亚伦帝国的影响。但是现在火之大教堂被毁了，亚伦死了。凤凰不再是你的威胁。}
### {276}{}{So be it. Give my consent to Ronnie, he runs the caravans in this pueblo.}
{276}{}{那就这样吧。我同意罗尼，他在这个普韦布洛经营商队。}
### {277}{}{Thank you.}
{277}{}{非常感谢。}
### {278}{}{I am ready to open caravan routes for Phoenix. But right in the middle of this path, a snake and an eagle started a fight. Until they agree or devour each other, it will be difficult to negotiate with buyers.}
{278}{}{我准备开通前往凤凰城的商队路线。但就在这条路的中间，一条蛇和一只鹰开始了一场打斗。除非他们同意或吞噬对方，否则很难与买家谈判。}
### {279}{}{Garage City also suffered from Aaron's empire. But the Cathedral of Fire was captured by the rebels, Aaron died. Phoenix is no longer a threat to you.}
{279}{}{车库城也受到了亚伦帝国的影响。但是火之大教堂被叛军占领了，亚伦死了。凤凰不再是你的威胁。}

### {300}{}{Who are you?}
{300}{}{你是谁？}
### {301}{}{You cross a valley, you walk through a whole pueblo and you don't know who is in front of you? It's strong. Then let's take care of your upbringing - I'm the one whose name is Geronimo. I am the supreme leader of my entire tribe.}
{301}{}{你穿过一个山谷，穿过整个普韦布洛，却不知道谁在你面前？它很强壮。那么，让我们照顾好你的成长――我就是那个叫杰罗尼莫的人。我是整个部落的最高领袖。}
### {302}{}{Tell me about yourself, Chief.}
{302}{}{跟我说说你自己吧，警长。}
### {303}{}{Do you really have such a short memory? Then it's worth refreshing it a little - I'm the one whose name is Geronimo. I am the supreme leader of the tribe.}
{303}{}{你真的记性这么差吗？然后值得稍微刷新一下――我就是那个叫Geronimo的人。我是部落的最高领袖。}
### {304}{}{Supreme? So there are others?}
{304}{}{最高的那么还有其他人吗？}
### {305}{}{The tribe consists of clans, each clan has its own leader or representative. Together we unite for a time of severe trials. And the rest of the time we wander around Sonora in search of food.}
{305}{}{部落由氏族组成，每个氏族都有自己的首领或代表。我们团结在一起度过了一段严峻的考验时期。剩下的时间我们在索诺拉四处寻找食物。}

### {312}{}{Sorry, Chief, but I don't have time to listen to long stories right now.}

{316}{}{我们在索诺拉的土地上生活了好几代人。我们的祖先甚至在世界从愤怒的婆罗门的愤怒中堕落之前就住在这里。}
### {317}{}{It's hard to believe that you were able to survive in the desert for so long.}
{317}{}{很难相信你能在沙漠中生存这么长时间。}
### {318}{}{It's a miracle that you managed to survive the War.}
{318}{}{你能在战争中幸存下来真是个奇迹。}
### {319}{}{For a long time, the tribe consisted of many small families scattered throughout the desert. Everyone survived as best they could. The infirm and sick died out, and the strong and healthy continued their kind. When the families multiplied and there was not enough land for everyone, clan wars began.}
{319}{}{很长一段时间以来，这个部落由许多分散在沙漠中的小家庭组成。每个人都尽力活了下来。体弱多病的人死了，强壮健康的人继续他们的同类。当家族繁衍，没有足够的土地容纳每个人时，部族战争就开始了。}
### {320}{}{Is there no war between the clans now?}

### {332}{}{Oh, yes, he is.}
{332}{}{哦，是的，他是。}
### {333}{}{My padre is not worth such words. He could not resist the invaders and surrendered.}
{333}{}{我的牧师不值得这样说。他无法抵抗侵略者而投降了。}
### {334}{}{But he made it clear that he did not want a stranger to set foot in the Villa. We have concluded an isolation agreement. However, our tribe does not happen in those parts anyway. There's too little grass for cattle.}
{334}{}{但他明确表示，他不希望一个陌生人踏入别墅。我们达成了一项隔离协议。然而，我们的部落无论如何都不会发生在那些地方。草太少，不能放牛。}
### {335}{}{There's nothing but desert all around.}
{335}{}{周围除了沙漠什么都没有。}
### {336}{}{It is all the more amazing that you are growing a crop in the middle of barren soil. It was as if the Divine Brahmin himself kept your lands... until recently. Maybe you angered him with something?}
{336}{}{更令人惊讶的是，你在贫瘠的土壤中种植作物。就好像神圣的婆罗门自己保护了你的土地。。。直到最近。也许你用什么激怒了他？}
### {337}{}{It is also interesting how such a miracle arose. But enough about my village. Shall we talk about yours?}
{337}{}{同样有趣的是，这样的奇迹是如何产生的。但我的村庄已经足够了。我们谈谈你的好吗？}
### {338}{}{I don't think so. We just lost our vigilance. And by the way, it's time for me to hit the road, to correct this stupid mistake. See you later, Chief.}
{338}{}{我不这么认为。我们只是失去了警惕。顺便说一句，是时候让我上路了，纠正这个愚蠢的错误。回头见，长官。}

{344}{}{嗯，你一定是在说那些存放在地下画廊里的旧物。}
### {345}{}{Underground galleries? What are you talking about?}
{345}{}{地下画廊？你在说什么？}
### {346}{}{You see, this ancient building has several floors buried by a layer of sand. There are still old things downstairs, but we don't need them. Therefore, no one goes down there and no one remembers what is there and what is not. And this is not the only buried place - the whole district has gone into the sand for several generations.}
{346}{}{你看，这座古老的建筑有几层被一层沙子掩埋。楼下还有旧东西，但我们不需要了。因此，没有人去那里，也没有人记得那里有什么，没有什么。这并不是唯一被埋葬的地方――整个地区已经被沙子掩埋了好几代人。}
### {347}{}{So can I come down and get them?}
{347}{}{我能下来拿吗？}
### {348}{}{Try. But prepare for the worst. A spirit test awaits you below. I myself have heard the voices of long-dead people there. You may never get out of these ancient chambers, like other treasure hunters who went down there in search of relics.}
{348}{}{尝试但要做好最坏的打算。下面有一场精神测试等着你。我自己也听到了那里死去已久的人们的声音。你可能永远无法走出这些古老的洞穴，就像其他去那里寻找遗迹的寻宝者一样。}
### {349}{}{I'll still take a chance. See you later, Chief.}
{349}{}{我还是要碰碰运气。回头见，长官。}
