### {100}{}{Here is Teresa.}
{100}{}{这是特蕾莎。}
### {101}{}{You see a short-haired woman in a hoodie. She has a very strict facial expression.}
{101}{}{你看到一个穿着连帽衫的短发女人。她的面部表情非常严厉。}
### {102}{}{I apologize. But I need to get some sleep before class.}
{102}{}{我道歉。但是上课前我需要睡一会儿。}
### {103}{}{How dare you scare children with your terrible armor?}
{103}{}{你怎么敢用你那可怕的盔甲吓唬孩子？}
### {104}{}{School is not a place for weapons.}
{104}{}{学校不是放武器的地方。}

### {200}{}{Hello. To what do I owe such attention?}
{200}{}{你好我该注意什么？}
### {201}{}{What is this place?}
{201}{}{这是什么地方？}
### {202}{}{Oh, how sad that modern people have forgotten what "school" means. Here we teach children the simplest sciences like literacy and mathematics. We are probably the only operating school in Sonora and Arizona.}
{202}{}{哦，现代人忘记了“学校”是什么意思，这是多么可悲啊。在这里，我们教孩子们最简单的科学，比如识字和数学。我们可能是索诺拉州和亚利桑那州唯一的运营学校。}
### {203}{}{But why do they need it?}
{203}{}{但他们为什么需要它？}
### {204}{}{So that the world does not slide into the Stone Age. Even now there is not a single school in the wastelands, much less a university. Ancient knowledge is forgotten, but new knowledge is not accumulated. After all, people are busy surviving, although a scientific approach would solve this problem as well.}
{204}{}{这样世界就不会滑入石器时代。即使是现在，荒原上也没有一所学校，更不用说一所大学了。古老的知识被遗忘了，但新的知识却没有积累起来。毕竟，人们正忙于生存，尽管科学的方法也能解决这个问题。}
### {205}{}{Who do you take me for, woman? I know what "school" is!}
{205}{}{你以为我是谁，女人？我知道什么是“学校”！}
### {206}{}{Well, if so. But it's unlikely that you studied there, judging by your tone.}
{206}{}{好吧，如果是的话。但从你的语气来看，你不太可能在那里学习。}
### {1206}{}{Well, if so. But it's unlikely you studied there, judging by your tone.}
{1206}{}{好吧，如果是的话。但从你的语气来看，你不太可能在那里学习。}
### {207}{}{Amazing! A real school! I thought they all closed down after the Great War.}
{207}{}{太神了一所真正的学校！我以为他们都在大战后倒闭了。}
### {208}{}{All right. We had to work hard to revive the good old tradition. Many residents did not even want to give up their children.}
{208}{}{好吧我们必须努力恢复古老的优良传统。许多居民甚至不想放弃他们的孩子。}
### {209}{}{By the way, who are you that teach children to write and count?}
{209}{}{顺便问一下，你是谁教孩子写字和数数的？}
### {210}{}{Who are you anyway to teach children to write and count?}
{210}{}{你到底是谁教孩子写字和数数？}
### {211}{}{How interesting. And who created this school?}
{211}{}{真有趣。是谁创建了这所学校？}
### {212}{}{We Are Followers Of the Apocalypse. Our mission is to bring enlightenment to the lands of Sonora.}
{212}{}{我们是启示录的追随者。我们的使命是给索诺拉的土地带来启示。}
### {213}{}{I see.}
{213}{}{我明白了。}
### {214}{}{By the way, I have come across Followers of Fire. They also have a library and they also teach children.}
{214}{}{顺便说一下，我遇到了火的追随者。他们还有一个图书馆，还教孩子们。}
### {215}{}{Ugh, these half-wits don't know what they're talking about. What can they teach with their twisted faith? Do not confuse the scientific school and theology. We, the Followers of the Apocalypse, are direct carriers of pre-war science.}
{215}{}{啊，这些半信半疑的人不知道他们在说什么。他们扭曲的信仰能教什么？不要混淆科学学派和神学。我们，启示录的追随者，是战前科学的直接载体。}
### {216}{}{Really?}
{216}{}{真正地}
### {217}{}{Don't believe religious fanatics. God only knows what's on their minds.}
{217}{}{不要相信宗教狂热分子。上帝只知道他们在想什么。}
### {218}{}{Good.}
{218}{}{好的}

### {220}{}{So what do you want to know?}
{220}{}{那么你想知道什么？}
### {221}{}{I know enough. Goodbye.}
{221}{}{我知道的够多了。再见}
### {222}{}{Wait a minute. Let's be clear - they teach knowledge here, not combat... "arts". We don't like violence, and we certainly won't tolerate it at school. So keep your fists, knives, and whatever else you have in stock with you. And there's nothing to smile so brazenly. You have been warned.}
{222}{}{等一下。让我们明确一点――他们在这里教授知识，而不是战斗。。。“艺术”。我们不喜欢暴力，在学校我们当然不会容忍。所以，把你的拳头、刀子和其他任何你手头的东西都留着。没有什么可以如此厚颜无耻地微笑。您已收到警告。}
### {223}{}{Agreed. My fighting skills will remain outside of school.}
{223}{}{同意。我的格斗技能将留在校外。}
### {224}{}{You watch your tongue, too, if you don't want problems.}
{224}{}{如果你不想惹麻烦，你也要注意你的舌头。}

### {230}{}{Tell the story of the Followers.}
{230}{}{讲述追随者的故事。}
### {231}{}{Initially, we were a small group of free residents on the ruins of San Diego. But it was impossible to live there, and then we moved to the ruins of Los Angeles. There, in the barely surviving library, we founded the headquarters, which exists to this day.}
{231}{}{最初，我们是圣地亚哥废墟上的一小群自由居民。但在那里生活是不可能的，然后我们搬到了洛杉矶的废墟上。在那里，在勉强幸存的图书馆里，我们建立了总部，它一直存在到今天。}
### {232}{}{Go on.}
{232}{}{继续}
### {233}{}{Look at this picture. It was made a hundred years ago in Inferno.}
{233}{}{看这张照片。它是一百年前在地狱制造的。}
### {234}{}{What is it... Oh my God, unbelievable! If the date is correct, then we have a real piece of ancient history in front of us!}
{234}{}{这是什么…天哪，难以置信！如果日期是正确的，那么我们面前就有一段真正的古代历史！}
### {235}{}{I see you are very pleased with this thing.}
{235}{}{我看你对这件事很满意。}
### {236}{}{We have not yet seen a single document from the time of the Great War. You see, they say the War passed in just a couple of hours. Thousands of nuclear bombs exploded all over the planet in this short period of time. Besides, a lot of time has passed since then, many documents have simply not been preserved. Needless to say, even if books have become very rare.}
{236}{}{我们还没有看到一份大战时期的文件。你看，他们说战争在几个小时内就结束了。在这短短的时间里，成千上万的核弹在地球上爆炸。此外，很多时间过去了，很多文件根本没有保存下来。不用说，即使书籍已经变得非常稀少。}
### {237}{}{Go on.}
{237}{}{继续}
### {238}{}{Here we have direct evidence of what the nuclear explosion in Mexicali looked like... Well, that's what this city was called before the War.}
{238}{}{在这里，我们有墨西卡利核爆炸的直接证据。。。这就是战前这个城市的名字。}
### {239}{}{Now it is called Inferno. Do you want to buy this thing?}
{239}{}{现在它被称为地狱。你想买这个东西吗？}
### {240}{}{Of course! Give it to us, for the sake of science.}
{240}{}{当然为了科学，把它给我们。}
### {241}{}{Of course, take it. Consider it my donation to the school.}
{241}{}{当然，拿着吧。把它当作我对学校的捐款吧。}
### {242}{}{Thank you very much. We will add your name to the list of benefactors.}
{242}{}{非常感谢。我们将把你的名字列入捐助者名单。}
### {243}{}{Not so fast. It cost me a lot of effort to get this thing and bring it here.}
{243}{}{没那么快。我花了很多精力才得到这个东西并把它带到这里。}
### {244}{}{OK. I'm going to talk to the other Followers now. We will try to collect a set of medicines for you. This is the most valuable thing in our city.}
{244}{}{好的。我现在要和其他追随者谈谈。我们将设法为您收集一套药品。这是我们城市最有价值的东西。}
### {245}{}{Here. Another thing.}
{245}{}{在这里还有一件事}
### {246}{}{I will give this thing away, but in return I want to listen to lectures about that era.}
{246}{}{我会把这个东西送人，但作为回报，我想听听关于那个时代的讲座。}
### {247}{}{Oh, what an honor.}
{247}{}{哦，真荣幸。}
### {248}{}{Since then, many people have joined us. And some, like me, go to remote lands for missionary purposes to establish a new temple of science there.}
{248}{}{从那时起，许多人加入了我们。有些人，像我一样，前往偏远的土地传教，在那里建立一座新的科学圣殿。}
### {249}{}{The temple of science? So are you still a religious organization?}
{249}{}{科学圣殿？你还是一个宗教组织吗？}
### {250}{}{No, no, it's just an old expression. Science and religion have little overlap. In any case, we don't want churches, because they will teach us to argue about God and belittle the gentiles.}
{250}{}{不，不，这只是一个古老的表达。科学和宗教几乎没有重叠。无论如何，我们不想要教会，因为他们会教我们争论上帝，贬低外邦人。}
### {251}{}{Thanks for the story.}
{251}{}{谢谢你的故事。}

### {260}{}{Where did these old books come from?}
{260}{}{这些旧书是从哪里来的？}
### {261}{}{Mostly they are brought by caravans. What has been preserved in the surrounding ruins, we have collected for a long time.}
{261}{}{他们大多是由大篷车带来的。在周围的废墟中保存下来的东西，我们已经收集了很长时间。}
### {262}{}{I see.}
{262}{}{我明白了。}
### {263}{}{Alas, these four small cabinets are a pitiful trifle compared to what is in the Los Angeles library. And most of these books are of little use for teaching or science.}
{263}{}{遗憾的是，这四个小柜子与洛杉矶图书馆的相比简直是微不足道。这些书大多对教学或科学没有什么用处。}
### {264}{}{I can bring books that I find when traveling.}
{264}{}{我可以带上旅行时发现的书。}
### {265}{}{Oh, that would be great. We have to appreciate any find. Of course we will pay for the work.}
{265}{}{哦，那太好了。我们必须感谢任何发现。我们当然会为这项工作付钱。}
### {266}{}{I'll keep that in mind. Goodbye.}
{266}{}{我会记住的。再见}
### {267}{}{I have an old book for your library.}
{267}{}{我有一本旧书给你们的图书馆。}
### {268}{}{Just fine. Where is she?}
{268}{}{很好。她在哪里？}
### {269}{}{She's in a different place. I'll bring it soon.}
{269}{}{她在另一个地方。我很快就会拿来。}
### {270}{}{This is the book.}
{270}{}{这就是那本书。}
### {271}{}{There are two whole books here.}
{271}{}{这里有整整两本书。}
### {272}{}{There are actually three of them. Here they are.}
{272}{}{实际上有三个。它们在这儿。}
### {273}{}{Take all the books I have. There's a whole stack of them here.}
{273}{}{把我所有的书都拿走。这里有一大堆。}
### {274}{}{Thank you very much. Here is the payment - }
{274}{}{非常感谢。这是付款-}
### {275}{}{ caps.}
{275}{}{帽子。}
### {276}{}{I'll bring more if I find it. Goodbye.}
{276}{}{如果我找到了，我会带更多的。再见。}
### {277}{}{Leave the bottlecaps to your school. This is my donation.}
{277}{}{把水瓶留给你的学校。这是我的捐款。}
### {278}{}{Thank you. This will help our school.}
{278}{}{非常感谢。这将有助于我们学校。}
### {279}{}{Goodbye.}
{279}{}{再见}

### {280}{}{Where can I get old books?}
{280}{}{我在哪里可以买到旧书？}
### {281}{}{We and our mercenaries have already surveyed the nearest ruins. I doubt that there are deposits of ancient books somewhere nearby. However, there is one place, but access to it is closed. This is a military base in Puerto.}
{281}{}{我们和我们的雇佣军已经勘察了最近的废墟。我怀疑附近是否有古籍存放处。然而，有一个地方，但通往它的通道是封闭的。这是波多黎各的一个军事基地。}
### {282}{}{Where would books come from on a military base?}
{282}{}{军事基地的书从哪里来？}
### {283}{}{These are not really books, but their electronic version. I know about it through communication with the scribes of the Brotherhood of Steel. But they gave an unequivocal refusal to my requests to share knowledge.}
{283}{}{这些不是真正的书，而是它们的电子版。我通过与钢铁兄弟会的抄写员交流了解到了这件事。但他们明确拒绝了我分享知识的请求。}
### {284}{}{Here are the misers.}
{284}{}{这些是守财奴。}
### {285}{}{They probably have their reasons.}
{285}{}{他们可能有自己的理由。}
### {286}{}{But old books are the property of all mankind, not just the chosen ones. Maybe you can get into the base and copy the texts? I'll pay and give you an empty holodisk to record.}
{286}{}{但是旧书是全人类的财产，而不仅仅是被选中的那些。也许你可以进入基地复制文本？我会付钱给你一个空全息光盘来录制。}
### {287}{}{I'm not on my way at all. Sorry.}
{287}{}{我根本不在路上。很抱歉}
### {288}{}{OK, I'll do it. Let's have a holodisk.}
{288}{}{好的，我来做。让我们做一个全息盘。}
### {289}{}{Thank you. Here's a holodisk. Copy on it at least the most important and necessary for our school. Good luck.}
{289}{}{非常感谢。这是一个全息盘。复制它至少是我们学校最重要和最必要的。祝你好运}
### {290}{}{Goodbye.}
{290}{}{再见}
### {291}{}{We and our mercenaries have already surveyed the nearest ruins. I doubt that there are deposits of ancient books somewhere nearby.}
{291}{}{我们和我们的雇佣军已经勘察了最近的废墟。我怀疑附近是否有古籍存放处。}
### {292}{}{I see. We'll have to look in more remote counties.}
{292}{}{我明白了。我们将不得不寻找更偏远的县。}
### {293}{}{I managed to infiltrate the Brotherhood's base and record their books.}
{293}{}{我设法潜入兄弟会的基地并记录了他们的书籍。}
### {294}{}{What wonderful news! We need books in any form. The Brotherhood has no moral right to hide them from the public.}
{294}{}{多么好的消息！我们需要任何形式的书。兄弟会没有道德权利向公众隐瞒这些书。}
### {295}{}{Here is the holodisk.}
{295}{}{这是全息盘。}
### {296}{}{I'll pay 100 caps for it. Thank you very much.}
{296}{}{我愿意付100顶。非常感谢。}
### {297}{}{Please.}
{297}{}{请}
