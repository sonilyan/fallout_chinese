#TALK ABOUT THE RENAISSANCE
#
### {910}{1}{Renaissance, you say? Yes, there are a lot of rumors about this place. Even the last ghoul in the Radius heard that there is a promising RENAISSANCE somewhere nearby, where it is warm, quiet, calm, plenty of food and water... Everyone knows this place exists, but hell, no one, absolutely no one, knows where it is.}
{910}{1}{你说文艺复兴？是的，关于这个地方有很多传言。就连Radius的最后一个食尸鬼也听说附近有一个很有希望的复兴之地，那里温暖、安静、平静，有充足的食物和水。。。每个人都知道这个地方的存在，但地狱，没有人，绝对没有人，知道它在哪里。}
### {911}{}{I see. Thanks for the information.}
{911}{}{我明白了。谢谢你提供的信息。}
### {912}{2}{Renaissance... [grins] Yeah, man, there is such a place, nice and warm. I know a lot of people have been looking for it. They even say someone has found it, but no one has ever seen this "someone" since. I mean, there was one kid who'd been to the Renaissance, but I don't know what happened to him.}
{912}{2}{文艺复兴是的，伙计，有这么一个地方，又好又暖和。我知道很多人一直在寻找它。他们甚至说有人找到了它，但从那以后就再也没有人见过这个“人”了。我的意思是，有一个孩子去过文艺复兴时期，但我不知道他发生了什么。}
### {913}{}{If somebody was there, then this place really exists. Thanks for that, too.}
{913}{}{如果有人在那里，那么这个地方真的存在。也谢谢你。}
### {914}{3}{Ah, so that's what you're up to! There was one just like you - just as inquisitive. But now he is not [chuckles]. The Renaissance is a locked-down secret governmental city. Probably, some presidents or monarchs live there. And people like you will be shot from half a mile on the way to this Renaissance of yours! Mark my words, stop looking for him, or you'll end up badly.}
{914}{3}{啊，那就是你要干的！有一个和你一样好奇。但现在他不是了。文艺复兴时期是一个封闭的秘密政府城市。可能有一些总统或君主住在那里。像你这样的人在去文艺复兴的路上会被枪杀半英里！记住我的话，别再找他了，否则你的下场会很糟糕的。}
### {915}{}{Yeah, that sounds dangerous... I guess I need to be more careful.}
{915}{}{是的，听起来很危险。。。我想我需要更加小心。}
### {916}{4}{The city of Eden, yeah... [rolls his eyes] They say it has smart vending machines that give out delicious food, provide light and heat... But, and I know for a fact, this place is very well hidden somewhere in the mountains. It's even surrounded by something that clouds your thoughts. You may not believe it, but a lot of people went looking for it and never came back! There was, however, one boy, who did. And he not only returned but also drew a map of how to find this place. The rumor goes like he divided this map into 4 parts and hid it in different corners of the Radius... Who knows if any of that is true. Maybe there's no such place as Renaissance?}
{916}{4}{伊甸城，是的。。。[翻白眼]他们说它有智能自动售货机，可以提供美味的食物，提供光和热。。。但是，我知道一个事实，这个地方隐藏在山区的某个地方。它甚至被一些模糊你思想的东西所包围。你可能不相信，但很多人去寻找它，却再也没有回来！然而，有一个男孩做到了。他不仅回来了，还画了一张如何找到这个地方的地图。传言说他把这张地图分成了四部分，并把它藏在了半径的不同角落。。。谁知道这些是否属实。也许没有文艺复兴这样的地方？}
### {917}{}{A map? With a map, it would be much easier to find it. Of course, if the Renaissance really exists...}
{917}{}{地图？有了地图，找到它会容易得多。当然，如果文艺复兴真的存在。。。}
### {918}{}{There's not much I can tell you. It seems that there is something somewhere, but no one knows where and what.}
{918}{}{我没什么好说的。似乎在某个地方有什么东西，但没有人知道在哪里和什么。}
### {919}{}{Renaissance, Paradise City, Heaven... [winks] I think it's like normal heaven - it doesn't exist.}
{919}{}{文艺复兴，天堂之城，天堂。。。[眨眼]我觉得这就像正常的天堂――它根本不存在。}
### {920}{}{There are many rumors, but no one knows anything specific.}
{920}{}{有很多传言，但没有人知道具体的事情。}
### {921}{}{Yes, people say different things, so you can choose what to believe and what not...}
{921}{}{是的，人们说不同的话，所以你可以选择相信什么和不相信什么。。。}
### {922}{}{I see.}
{922}{}{我明白了。}
### {923}{}{Okay, I see.}
{923}{}{好吧，我明白了。}
### {924}{}{Well, of course, yes.}
{924}{}{当然，是的。}
