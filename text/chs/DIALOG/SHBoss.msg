{122}{}{我很强壮。也不像你楼下的人-他们不像你一样强硬。甚至是我。}
#{123}{}{I'm a cat in the night. Anyone can kick in a door, but I can be miles away before my victims even know I was there.}
{123}{}{我是夜猫子。任何人都可以踢门，但在受害者知道我在那里之前，我可以在几英里之外。}

{124}{}{我精通炸药。你想有人死吗？我要消灭他们全家。你想把东西弄坏吗？你会认为它根本就不存在。我可以把事情做得比你现在的人完全不同。}

{133}{}{没问题。现在，我能拿回我的东西吗？}
#{134}{}{[He roots through your things for some time before he's satisfied] You can take your things. But don't be so happy. I want to see you in action. You get the job done, you're in the gang. If you don't... Well, you'll understand it on your way there. We won't even have to get our hands dirty.}
{134}{}{[在他满意之前，他把你的东西翻了一段时间]你可以拿走你的东西。但别那么高兴。我想看到你的行动。你完成了任务，就加入了帮派。如果你不。。。好吧，你去的路上会明白的。我们甚至不用把手弄脏。}
#{135}{}{I'm listening.}

{137}{}{[听我说]}
#{138}{}{There's a pre-war army base to the south of here. My dogs tried to get in, but the turrets are still on. To get around them - that's your headache now. I'll send a couple of my boys to help out, but they won't risk their necks for you. This is YOUR job. Got it?}
{138}{}{在这里的南面有一个战前的军事基地。我的狗想进去，但炮塔还在。绕过他们-这是你现在头疼的事。我会派几个孩子去帮忙，但他们不会为你冒险的。这是你的工作。知道了？}

#{204}{}{The business's good, get it? Still - one player forgets to pay his cut. Name's Stryker, lays in Reno. You should remind him about which hand is holding the leash. That's the password, by the way. He'll understand. Go get me my share.}

#{212}{}{Sorry, assassinations aren't my style.}
{212}{}{抱歉，暗杀不是我的风格。}
#{213}{}{[He stares down at you, his eyes narrowing to pinpricks] What was that? It sounded like you said, "I want to die in the ring, boss." But you're going to be too busy in Reno killing Balder, aren't you?}

#{214}{}{What is it? Is Balder dead yet?}
{214}{}{它是什么？巴尔德死了吗？}

#{226}{}{The package is from Vegas. They say someone is cooking up some new chem there. It hasn't hit Reno yet. I want the first look... And I want those bloated rats in Reno to remember who Big Louie is.}
{226}{}{包裹是从维加斯寄来的。他们说那里有人在做新的化学制品。还没到雷诺。我想要第一眼。。。我想让里诺那些臃肿的老鼠记住谁是大路易。}
#{227}{}{Bloated rats? What do you mean?}
{227}{}{臃肿的老鼠？什么意思？}
#{228}{}{You are wasting time! But I'll tell you. This is important. Reno is forgetting Big Louie. My boys, Stryker and Thompson, are going their own ways, and the local dealers are gaining more power. The situation gets worse every day. I can't allow anyone in Reno become stronger without the control of my people. Now go, time is money!}
{228}{}{你在浪费时间！但我会告诉你的。这很重要。雷诺忘了大路易。我的儿子，史崔克和汤普森，正在走自己的路，当地的经销商正在获得更多的权力。情况每天都在恶化。我不能让里诺的任何人在没有我的人控制的情况下变得更强大。走吧，时间就是金钱！}

#{237}{}{[His eyes seem to sparkle as he opens the package] Well, well, what a big boy I am now! And there's something here for you, too! [he gives you 3000 dollars and two stimpaks] Now kick back. There's no more work right now.}
{237}{}{[当他打开包裹时，他的眼睛似乎闪闪发光]好吧，好吧，我现在是个多大的男孩啊！这里也有你的东西！[他给了你3000美元和两个Stimpak]现在退后。现在没有工作了。}

{243}{}{这个供应商必须有一个死亡愿望。}

#{252}{}{You don't look very happy.}

#{253}{}{[He sighs deeply] Honestly, brother, I'm tired. I'm getting sick of all this... Oh, forget it. The season's over, nothing to do but milk the tribe and rob caravans. You can go on your way. I'm not holding you here any longer.}

#{254}{}{What? I'm out of the gang?}
{254}{}{什么？我不在帮派里了？}
#{255}{}{It's not like that. You'll always have a place here. But the rest of the boys can take it from here, and I can tell you have other things to do than sit around and hassle Indians. There's nothing left for you to do anyway.}

#{266}{}{ARRGGGHH!!! [he smashes the table with his fists, you hear wood crusting] YOU WORTHLESS SLUGS! HOW COULD YOU FAIL SUCH A... YOU!!! [he points at you] GET OUT!}
{266}{}{啊！！！[他用拳头砸碎桌子，你听到木头剥皮]你这个没用的鼻涕虫！你怎么能这样失败。。。你！！！[他指着你]出去！}

{267}{}{[退出]}
#{268}{}{I have a better idea: stick that base up your ass. Find someone else for this job. I'm not doing it.}
{268}{}{我有个更好的主意：把你的屁股翘起来。找其他人做这个工作。我不会这么做的。}

#{270}{}{Interesting. Who is Armstrong?}
{270}{}{很有趣。阿姆斯特朗是谁？}
#{276}{}{[He shoots you a severe look] Do I look like a librarian? Get lost!}
{276}{}{[他严厉地看了你一眼]我看起来像图书管理员吗？滚开！}
#{277}{}{Calm down, I'm just asking.}
{277}{}{冷静点，我只是问问。}
#{278}{}{Louie's an idol. That's all I'm going to say about that. Now, get lost!}
{278}{}{路易是个偶像。这就是我要说的。现在，滚开！}
#{279}{}{Relax, it was a simple question, that's all.}
{279}{}{别紧张，这只是个简单的问题，仅此而已。}
#{280}{}{[He studies you for a moment, thinking] Louie Armstrong was... A man, truly worthy of respect. Now, get lost!}
{280}{}{[他研究了你一会儿，心想]路易・阿姆斯特朗。。。一个真正值得尊敬的人。现在，滚开！}
#{281}{}{I was just curious, that's all.}
{281}{}{我只是好奇而已。}
#{282}{}{Hmmm... He was a childhood hero of mine. But that was a long time ago... Forget it. I'm not going to talk about it.}
{282}{}{六羟甲基三聚氰胺六甲醚。。。他是我儿时的英雄。但那是很久以前的事了。。。算了吧。我不想谈这个。}
#{283}{}{Alright, fine. Maybe later, then.}
{283}{}{好吧，很好。也许以后吧。}
#{284}{}{[He sighs] Louie Armstrong... Now, there was a man. He was my hero, my role model. He died a hundred years before I was born, but no one in this trash dump of a world could be closer to me... Look, forget it. It doesn't matter now.}
{284}{}{路易・阿姆斯特朗。。。现在，有一个人。他是我的英雄，我的榜样。他在我出生前一百年就死了，但在这个垃圾堆里没有人能离我更近。。。听着，算了吧。现在不重要了。}
#{285}{}{Tell me your story.}
{285}{}{告诉我你的故事。}
#{286}{}{You don't want to remember?}

{287}{}{阿姆斯特朗到底是谁？}
#{288}{}{Fine, whatever you say.}

#{289}{}{It was a long time ago. I'd bring those days back if I could, but I can't.}
{289}{}{那是很久以前的事了。如果可以的话，我会把那些日子带回来，但我不能。}

{290}{}{[下一步]}
#{291}{}{After the war, the gangs tore Reno apart. In the end, the elites won, mainly with the police heading them. They made the city safe - I mean, safer than before. You could walk around without a gun.}
{291}{}{战后，黑帮把雷诺撕成两半。最后，精英们获胜，主要是由警察领导。他们让城市变得安全了-我是说，比以前更安全了。你可以不用枪到处走。}
#{292}{}{I was young then. I used to sneak to the local bar at night to listen to the music. I wasn't allowed inside, but the sounds always found their way out to me. There were a lot of musicians, but I loved the Great Louie's songs the most. Somehow, he just made the world seem... Wonderful. Like something worth living in.}
{292}{}{那时我还年轻。我以前晚上偷偷去当地的酒吧听音乐。我不被允许进去，但我总能听到声音。有很多音乐家，但我最喜欢伟大的路易的歌曲。不知怎的，他只是让世界看起来。。。精彩的。像是值得居住的地方。}
#{293}{}{After a few years, the law broke down and Reno became a hellhole again. No more Armstrong after that.}
{293}{}{几年后，法律崩溃了，雷诺又成了一个地狱。之后再也没有阿姆斯特朗了。}
#{294}{}{You weren't always the top dog around here?}
{294}{}{你不是一直都是这里的头号人物吗？}
#{295}{}{You mean a vicious killer, leading mindless thugs to prey on the weak and abandoned? No. I was educated, sophisticated. A *man*, not one of these animals. I even started my own jazz band, but the life made me choose between it and a mob gang. I'd never have survived otherwise. Anyway, now I look back on things and I see them differently. That Indian shaman - he's a wise man. He told me the truth about people. About my people. [he motions towards the floor] The ones downstairs... And the ones up here.}
{295}{}{你是说一个恶毒的杀手，带领愚蠢的暴徒去掠夺弱者和被遗弃的人？不，我受过教育，很老练。人，不是这些动物中的一个。我甚至创办了自己的爵士乐队，但生活让我在乐队和黑帮之间做出选择。否则我就活不下去了。不管怎样，现在我回首往事，看到的都不一样了。那个印度巫师-他是个聪明人。他告诉我关于人的真相。关于我的人。[他走向地板]楼下的那些。。。还有上面的那些。}
#{296}{}{Would you ever want to play jazz again?}
{296}{}{你还想再演奏爵士乐吗？}
#{297}{}{I'd kill to have that chance again! But with my reputation...}
{297}{}{我真想再给你一次机会！但以我的名誉。。。}
#{298}{}{Jazz is the only good memory I've got left.}
{298}{}{爵士乐是我仅存的美好记忆。}
#{299}{}{Armstrong's voice was the only one on this cursed planet worth listening to. Such people should never die - they should live forever. I learned every song by heart. I can even sing them now... But I won't. Not for this wastes downstairs.}
{299}{}{阿姆斯特朗的声音是这个被诅咒的星球上唯一值得倾听的声音。这样的人不应该死，他们应该永远活着。我把每首歌都背下来了。我现在甚至可以唱了。。。但我不会的。不是因为这个。}
#{300}{}{No work right now. This place is as quiet as a church.}
{300}{}{现在没有工作。这个地方像教堂一样安静。}
#{301}{}{I found a job opening for a singer in a band, if you're interested.}
{301}{}{如果你感兴趣的话，我在一个乐队找到了一个歌手的职位空缺。}
#{302}{}{Bye, then.}

#{303}{}{Is this some kind of joke, boy?}
{303}{}{这是什么玩笑吗，孩子？}
#{304}{}{No joke. It's in Vegas... [tell him about the cafe]}
{304}{}{不是开玩笑。在维加斯。。。[告诉他咖啡馆的事]}
#{305}{}{Wait... Are you saying... I'll be able to to tour between Vegas and Reno? I can't believe it! I'll do it! HA-HA! I'll never forget you, brother! You've given me another chance at the only thing I ever loved! Let's arm wrestle for goodbye!}
{305}{}{等待。。。你是说。。。我能在维加斯和雷诺之间旅行吗？真不敢相信！我会的！哈哈！我永远不会忘记你，兄弟！你又给了我一次机会去看我唯一爱的东西！让我们为再见而摔跤吧！}

{306}{}{不用谢。拉斯维加斯见！}
#{307}{}{Holy crap! Big Louie believed you and went to Vegas to perform on stage!}
{307}{}{我靠！大路易相信你，去维加斯演出了！}
#{310}{}{I managed to get into Hawthorne and gain access to the storage. The guys should arrive with the weapons any minute now.}
{310}{}{我设法进入了霍桑，进入了储藏室。他们随时都会带着武器来的。}
#{311}{}{I managed to get into Hawthorne and gain access to the storage. The guys stayed behind... Forever.}
{311}{}{我设法进入了霍桑，进入了储藏室。他们留下来了。。。永远。}

#{1107}{}{I'm here to drain the blood from your corpse, skin your men for leather, and burn this building to the ground!}
{1107}{}{我来这里是要把你尸体上的血抽干，剥去你手下的皮，把这座建筑夷为平地！}
#{1108}{}{Funny, your mother called me that last night. But she had better things to do with her tongue than talk.}
{1108}{}{有趣的是，你妈妈昨晚打电话给我。但她最好用舌头说话，而不是说话。}
#{1110}{}{[He growls] You arrogant COW! I HATE smug bitches like you! Bring her to the dogs. We haven't had a fight in a long time!}
{1110}{}{[他咆哮]你这傲慢的母牛！我讨厌像你这样自鸣得意的婊子！带她去见狗。我们好久没打架了！}

#{1131}{}{I'm convinced. But I warn you - this is for life. You are either with me, or gone. [he pounds one fist into his palm] Permanently!}
{1131}{}{我确信。但我警告你-这是为了生活。你要么和我在一起，要么就走了。[他一拳砸在手掌上]永远！}
#{1132}{}{Hey, I didn't sign up for this! I'm out of here!}
{1132}{}{嘿，我没有报名参加！我要走了！}
#{1143}{}{Just remember, time is money. Don't keep me waiting. [his knuckles crack as his hands curl into fists] If I have to go looking for you, you'd better already be dead.}
{1143}{}{记住，时间就是金钱。别让我等了。[他的手蜷缩成拳头，关节裂开]如果我要去找你，你最好已经死了。}
#{1145}{}{Ahh, a go-getter! Great. The men will be ready to move out in an hour.}
{1145}{}{啊，一个能干的人！伟大的。这些人一小时后就可以搬走了。}
#{1147}{}{[He studies you carefully] Yes. Yes, I can tell someone like you would have a place here. But tell me, girl - what *exactly* do you bring to me?}
{1147}{}{[他仔细研究你]是的。是的，我可以告诉像你这样的人在这里会有一个地方。但是告诉我，女孩-你到底给我带了什么？}

#{1200}{}{Aren't you the capable one! My pack is now fully equipped. You've earned some respect. Consider yourself one of us. So, for starters, go grab a beer or something from Fatso and relax, and when you're done, come see me. We'll have real talk. Big plans.}
{1200}{}{你不是那个能干的人吗！我的背包现在装备齐全了。你赢得了一些尊重。把你自己当成我们中的一员。所以，首先，去从胖子那里拿杯啤酒什么的放松一下，等你喝完了，再来找我。我们会好好谈谈的。大计划。}

#{1220}{}{[Big Louie's jaw clenches. His narrowed eyes smolder with rage.] I'll only say one thing about this. You are *almost* a deadmeat, marimacho.}

#{1244}{}{[He frowns] He should pay in blood! It's not even about the boys - we'll bury them, and they'll stop stinking. It's about Reno itself. The city had... Forgotten who Big Louie is.

{1244}{}{[他皱眉]他应该付出鲜血！这和孩子们无关-我们会把他们埋了，他们就不会发臭了。关于雷诺本身。这个城市。。。忘了谁是大路易了。史崔克和汤普森不受约束了，两个小推手在欺骗胖子。。。我们得发个信息。你必须为我做这件事。。。为了帮派。雷诺必须记住。}
