Of course, I'm counting on a position in middle management or higher for this. I suppose it's obvious.}
{120}{}{去那里和他们的领导谈谈。告诉他们，如果没有一个内部人员，他们将无法成功。我愿意提供帮助，并准备成为他们在这里的官方代表。当他们的部队到达时，我会帮助他们在这里站稳脚跟，并在尽可能短的时间内与当地人打交道。当然，我指望的是一个中层或更高级别的管理职位。我想这是显而易见的。}

### {262}{998}{[...knock out a handful of his teeth.]}
{262}{998}{[…打掉他的一把牙齿。]}
### {263}{998}{[...punch his Adam's Apple right into his throat.]}
{263}{998}{[…把他的苹果直接打到喉咙里。]}
### {264}{998}{[...turn his nose into a mush of bone shreds and blood.]}
{264}{998}{[…把他的鼻子变成一团骨头碎片和血。]}
### {265}{998}{[...give him an uppercut to the chin, breaking his neck.]}

### {269}{999}{[...stop yourself. Then take a deep breath and calm down.]}
{269}{999}{[…住手。然后深吸一口气，冷静下来。]}

### {270}{}{[Seth quietly sighs and continues in a patronizing tone] I know, to the one of your kind, some simple things can be complicated, and sometimes even beyond reach. You see, I don't actually hate them. I only call the things by their names. Whether you like it or not, NWO is a herd of cattle. A herd of brainless, stinking cattle, which doesn't know respect, doesn't care for science or art. These things are way beyond their level. Cattle by itself is not capable of making this world a better place. The cattle have only one purpose - to serve the higher power on its way to prosperity. A quite worthy purpose, by the way. But cattle has been without its herder for too long. It became prideful and longs for power which it can't handle. Try to show the cattle its place - and it will stomp you to death.}
{270}{}{[赛斯安静地叹了口气，用一种屈尊俯就的语气继续说道]我知道，对于你这种人来说，有些简单的事情可能会很复杂，有时甚至遥不可及。你看，我其实并不讨厌他们。我只是直呼其名。不管你喜不喜欢，NWO就是一群牛。一群没有头脑、臭气熏天的牛，不懂得尊重，不关心科学或艺术。这些东西远远超出了他们的水平。牛本身无法使这个世界变得更美好。牛只有一个目的――在通往繁荣的道路上为更高的权力服务。顺便说一句，这是一个非常有价值的目标。但是牛已经离开牧民太久了。它变得骄傲，渴望它无法掌控的权力。试着给牛看它的位置，它会把你踩死的。}
### {271}{028}{[keep listening]}
{271}{028}{[继续听]}
### {272}{022}{I see. I wanted to ask something else.}
{272}{022}{我明白了。我想问别的问题。}
### {273}{999}{I'll listen to the rest of it some other time. [end]}
{273}{999}{我改天再听剩下的。[完]}

### {280}{}{In the chaos of our world, cattle fight themselves and other herds of the same cattle. But, as all chaos seeks harmony, sooner or later the master will come for the cattle. And cattle will begin to serve, fulfilling its purpose. Try to understand, I don't hate NWO at all. I'm just obliged to live near them and tolerate their smugness, ignorance, sass, and untidiness. I am patiently waiting for the master to come for his cattle. And soon my patience will be rewarded.}
{280}{}{在我们这个混乱的世界里，牛与自己和其他同类牛搏斗。但是，当所有的混乱都在寻求和谐时，主人迟早会来抓牛。牛将开始服务，实现它的目的。试着去理解，我一点也不讨厌NWO。我只是不得不住在他们附近，容忍他们的自鸣得意、无知、粗鲁和邋遢。我耐心地等着主人来取他的牛。我的耐心很快就会得到回报。}
### {281}{029}{Your worldview disgusts me, but to discuss it with you disgusts me even more.}
{281}{029}{你的世界观让我恶心，但与你讨论它更让我恶心。}

### {284}{999}{See you soon.}
{284}{999}{再见。}

### {290}{}{[Sam grits his teeth and hisses, bulging his eyes] You know what, you, offspring of a nameless wench?! You can go and TALK about it WITH THE PILE OF MANURE OR A PUDDLE OF PUKE!! DO YOU HEAR ME, YOU, ARROGANT, PIG-FACED SAVAGE?!}
{290}{}{[山姆咬牙切齿，发出嘶嘶声，瞪大眼睛]你知道吗，你，一个无名女子的后代？！你可以去和一堆人或一堆人谈论它！！你听到我说话了吗，你这个傲慢的、长着猪脸的野蛮人？！}

{311}{022}{我明白了。我还有一些问题。}
### {312}{999}{See you soon.}
{312}{999}{再见。}

### {320}{}{You wouldn't understand. That cretin never listened to me, never showed me enough respect. Instead, he chose to spend his whole life dreaming about some nonsense. Damn imbecile.}
{320}{}{你不会理解的。那个白痴从来不听我的话，从来没有对我表示足够的尊重。相反，他选择了用一生的时间去梦想一些无稽之谈。该死的白痴。}

### {332}{022}{I want to ask about something else.}
{332}{022}{我想问一些其他的事情。}

As soon as their forces take over this place, you get the position you deserved: a job of my personal assistant. As for now - take this. [Seth hands you the weapon repair kit] This belonged to my father. I don't need it, and I suppose you'll put it to better use.}
{420}{}{太棒了！我想你是在等你的奖励吧？好吧，我是信守诺言的人。一旦他们的部队占领了这个地方，你就会得到你应得的职位：我的私人助理。至于现在――拿这个。[赛斯把武器修理包递给你]这是我父亲的。我不需要它，我想你会更好地利用它的。}
