{300}{}{Yes! The dice love me!}
{301}{}{Oh, that was close.}
{302}{}{Don't interrupt me. You'll ruin my winning streak.}
{303}{}{I'm hot!}
{304}{}{Money, money, money!}
{305}{}{I love this game!}
{306}{}{You see that! Yes!}
{307}{}{Roulette is the game to play!}
{308}{}{I'm doing pretty good, how about you?}
{309}{}{I'm doing better than normal.}
{310}{}{Great place don't you think?}
{311}{}{Mary's tables are the best.}
{312}{}{You like this game? It's a lot of fun.}
{313}{}{I haven't had a good roll in a while.}
{314}{}{I need a good roll.}
{315}{}{Well, at least I'm not losing.}
{316}{}{I'm not going anywhere.}
{317}{}{I'm just breaking even.}
{318}{}{You've got to play the numbers.}
{319}{}{Just betting on the red or black is bad odds.}
{320}{}{The dice aren't behaving.}
{321}{}{I'm down and it's not looking good.}
{322}{}{I hope you do better than I.}
{323}{}{I've seen better days.}
{324}{}{I know how to play, honest.}
{325}{}{The ball's not bouncing my way today.}
{326}{}{Another payday lost for good.}
{327}{}{I'm almost broke!}
{328}{}{Damn it. This sucks.}
{329}{}{Why does this always happen to me?}
{330}{}{I can't win.}
{331}{}{I hate this game.}
