{100}{}{[You notice an attractive middle aged woman. She has that warm, friendly smile, like she knows you from
 somewhere but with a spark of surprise.] Oh... hello, can I help you with something?}
{101}{}{Actually yes, I'm looking for Garol's wife... I have a letter for her, it's from her husband.}
#
{102}{}{Well I don't know her, but she is one lucky wife. [Laughs.] I'm Garol's wife, so nice to meet you,
 stranger. How can I ever repay you for being so kind... I've been saving some money, please take it.}
{103}{}{Well, thank you. [Hand her the letter.] I was glad to help. So tell me, how's your son doing?}
#
{104}{}{My Steve? He's doing fine, thanks. He lives with me now... I hope my husband manages to work something
 out. I miss him very much... [sighs].}
{105}{}{Yeah, I'm sure he will. He's a hard working man... Well it's time for me to go.}
#
{106}{}{Thank you again, kind traveler.}
{107}{}{Take care.}
#
{108}{}{Thank you.}
{109}{}{I won't forget this.}
{110}{}{I wish you luck in your travels.}
#
{111}{}{Hello, I'm a little busy here... Can I help you in any way?}
{112}{}{Can you tell Garol's wife that her husband sent her a personal letter. But then... it got misplaced... I mean...
 uh... I lost it.}
#
{113}{}{What, you lost it!? How could you!? That was the only way I could know if he is alright. You're gonna pay
 for this, you bastard!}
{114}{}{Sorry, I'm...}

{115}{}{[You take a quick glance at her lips as she talks. You find it somehow mesmerizing.] Excuse me, I have this
 feeling... like we met before. Care to join me for a drink?}
{116}{}{You are going to need that money more, just keep it. Your thanks is good enough for me... [Hand her the
 letter.] How is your son?}
#
{117}{}{[Surprised.] Oh, don't be silly, I really would mind. [Smiles.] Having one child is enough as it is.}
{118}{}{[You smile.] Nevermind, forget it. I'm glad I could help. [Hand her the letter.]}
{119}{}{Listen woman, I'm grown up and I can take care of myself. [Speaking softly.] You wouldn't feel bad at all, I
 guarantee.}
#
{120}{}{[Closes her eyes for a second, sighs. Then bursts into a fit of anger.] Listen, boy! Don't make me call my
 friends, they'll bust your face till you look like that brahmin, got it!}
{121}{}{Wow, easy there... I overreacted a bit. Just take this letter, I won't bother you no more. [Hand her the letter.]}
{122}{}{I would like to see that!}

{123}{}{Why you crazy bitch! I saw the man personally and he seemed well... Have it your way!}
