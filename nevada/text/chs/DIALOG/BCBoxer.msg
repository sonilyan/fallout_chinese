#{100}{}{You see a strong man.}
{100}{}{你看到一个强壮的男人。}
#{101}{}{You see Mike.}
{101}{}{你看到迈克了。}
#{102}{}{You see a large, very muscular man.}
{102}{}{你看到一个身材高大，肌肉发达的男人。}
#{110}{}{[He raises one eyebrow] You ever held a golf ball, boy? With one hit, you can take a 90-pound midget's head clean off from 300 yards...}
{110}{}{你拿过高尔夫球吗？只要一拳，你就能把一个90磅重的侏儒的头从300码外干掉...}
#{111}{}{Er, why would I want to do that?}
{111}{}{呃，我为什么要这么做？}
#{112}{}{That sounds like quite a sight. Maybe I'll try it on you.}
{112}{}{听起来真是一幅景象。也许我会给你试试。}
#{113}{}{[He rolls his eyes] I'm bored with you, boy. Leave.}
{113}{}{[他翻白眼]我受够你了，孩子。离开。}
#{114}{}{Well, that conversation didn't last long.}
{114}{}{嗯，那次谈话没持续多久。}
#{115}{}{You should mind your own business... [signs] Fine. I was banned for chem use. "Unfair advantage", the boss said. He'd never have known if I wasn't caught with that fucknut dealer. They chased him out of town, too.}
{115}{}{你应该管好自己的事...[手势]好的。我被禁止使用化学药品。”“不公平的优势”，老板说。如果我没有被那个该死的毒贩抓住，他永远不会知道。他们也把他赶出了镇子。}
#{116}{}{[He throws back his head and laughs] Finally, someone with a sense of humor in this shithole! Name's Mike. I was one of the best fighters in Reno 'til they kicked me out. Now I'm stuck in this graveyard. Fuck, there's no way to get the blood pumping out here, except hunting.}
{116}{}{[他低下头笑]最后，一个在这鬼地方有幽默感的人！我叫迈克。我是雷诺最好的拳手之一，直到他们把我踢出去。现在我被困在这个墓地里。妈的，除了打猎，这里没有办法让血流出来。}
#{117}{}{I can spar with you, if that's what you want.}
{117}{}{如果你想的话，我可以跟你打。}
#{118}{}{You know, I don't like fighting... I don't think we have much to talk about. I'd better go.}
{118}{}{你知道，我不喜欢打架...我想我们没什么好谈的。我最好走了。}
#{119}{}{[Looks you up and down appraisingly] I don't think so, shrimpy. Let me drink in peace.}
{119}{}{[上下打量你]我不这么认为，小虾。让我安静地喝。}
#{120}{}{Relax, I only want to know what you're doing here.}
{120}{}{别紧张，我只想知道你在这里干什么。}
#{121}{}{Fine. I was just leaving, anyway.}
{121}{}{好的。反正我正要离开。}
#{122}{}{What am I doing here? I'm *trying* to get wasted... The name's Mike, by the way. Ever heard of me? I was one of the best fighters in Reno 'til they kicked me out. Now I'm dying of boredom up here. Fuck, there's no way to get the blood pumping out here, except hunting.}
{122}{}{我在这里干什么？我试着去浪费时间...顺便说一下，我叫迈克。听说过我吗？我是雷诺最好的拳手之一，直到他们把我踢出去。现在我在这无聊死了。妈的，除了打猎，这里没有办法让血流出来。}
#{123}{}{Hell yeah! I'm going to love breaking your face!}
{123}{}{见鬼，耶！我会喜欢打破你的脸！}
#{124}{}{That's all you think about, isn't it?}
{124}{}{你就是这么想的，不是吗？}
#{125}{}{I'll have your head ringing so hard you'll think the bombs are dropping again! But before we start, let's lay down the rules.}
{125}{}{我会让你的脑袋响得很厉害，你会以为炸弹又掉下来了！但在我们开始之前，让我们制定规则。}
#{126}{}{Rules?}
{126}{}{规则？}
#{127}{}{This ain't some fucking street brawl, it's an *art*. The game's called "Stay away from Mike". We tie our left hands together so you can't run off, and take turns hitting each other in the face. Break the rules, and you can go fuck yourself.}
{127}{}{这不是街头斗殴，这是艺术。这个游戏叫“离迈克远点”。我们把左手绑在一起，这样你就不会逃跑，然后轮流打对方的脸。违反规则，你就可以去操你自己。}
#{128}{}{We're not fighting to the death, are we?}
{128}{}{我们不是在战斗到死，是吗？}
#{129}{}{Why are you so desperate to hit somebody in the face?}
{129}{}{你为什么这么急着打别人的脸？}
#{130}{}{What do you think of my chances?}
{130}{}{你觉得我的机会怎么样？}
#{131}{}{Enough talk, let??s do this!}
{131}{}{说够了，我们来吧！}
#{132}{}{I need some time to prepare.}
{132}{}{我需要一些时间来准备。}
#{133}{}{Nah, this ain't like that. Back in the ring, death was just something that happened, but hereabouts I don't want to hear people saying "Oh, there's Mike, he beats people to death for talking to him."}
{133}{}{不是这样的。回到拳击场，死亡只是发生过的事情，但在这附近我不想听到人们说“哦，迈克，他因为和他说话而把人打得要死。”}
#{134}{}{I'm losing my goddamn mind, sitting around doing nothing. I've got to keep in shape, you know? My coach always told me, "Mike, you need to practice. Just having muscles won't do the job!"}
{134}{}{我他妈的疯了，坐着什么都不做。我得保持身材，你知道吗？我的教练总是告诉我，“迈克，你需要练习。只有肌肉不行！”}
#{135}{}{[He looks you up and down] Not bad. I may just have to bring my A-game.}
{135}{}{[他上下打量你]不错。我可能得带上我的A-game。}
#{136}{}{[He looks you up and down] Between slim and none, and slim just left town. But I could be wrong.}
{136}{}{[他上下打量着你]在斯利姆和没有之间，斯利姆刚刚离开了小镇。但我可能错了。}
#{137}{}{[Smirks and cracks his knuckles] See you outside, small fry!}
{137}{}{[傻笑和关节裂开]外面见，小家伙！}
#{138}{}{Better go take a picture of your face so you can remember how it used to look.}
{138}{}{最好给你的脸照张相，这样你就能记得它以前的样子了。}
#{139}{}{No hard feelings, small fry!}
{139}{}{别难过，小家伙！}
#{140}{}{[Shields his face] Enough! Enough! You win! Here's a hundred bucks, take it. Damn! I need a drink or three...}
{140}{}{够了！够了！你赢了！这是一百块，拿去吧。该死！我需要喝一两杯...}
#{141}{}{If only more people would pay me to beat them up. See you, Mike.}
{141}{}{要是有更多的人付钱让我揍他们就好了。再见，迈克。}
#{142}{}{Ha! You know, there's easier ways to commit suicide! Alright, enough of this, I'm going to the bar. Maybe if you ask lightly, someone will help you look for your teeth.}
{142}{}{哈！你知道，自杀有更简单的方法！好了，够了，我要去酒吧了。如果你轻轻地问，也许会有人帮你找牙。}
#{143}{}{This is a cruel game, Mike...}
{143}{}{这是个残酷的游戏，迈克...}
#{144}{}{If you were that good, they wouldn't have kicked you out. Unless... You did something you shouldn't have.}
{144}{}{如果你那么好，他们就不会把你赶出去了。除非...你做了不该做的事。}
#{145}{}{Shit, you're a bit too clever. I was kicked out for chem use. "Unfair advantage", the boss said. He'd never have known if I wasn't caught with that fucknut dealer. They chased him out of town, too.}
{145}{}{妈的，你太聪明了。我被赶出去用化学药品。”“不公平的优势”，老板说。如果我没有被那个该死的毒贩抓住，他永远不会知道。他们也把他赶出了镇子。}
#{146}{}{Let's fight! That's what you want, right?}
{146}{}{我们战斗吧！这就是你想要的，对吧？}
#{150}{}{Next time, we fight to the death.}
{150}{}{下一次，我们战斗到死亡。}
#{151}{}{Then you'd better get your affairs in order.}
{151}{}{那你最好把事情安排好。}
#{152}{}{I hope there isn't a next time, then.}
{152}{}{我希望没有下次了。}
#{153}{}{[He smirks] We'll see.}
{153}{}{我们拭目以待。}
#{154}{}{You said something about fighting in Reno. Tell me more about that.}
{154}{}{你说了些在里诺打仗的事。告诉我更多。}
#{155}{}{I want to ask you something else.}
{155}{}{我想问你点别的。}
#{156}{}{You really know how to throw a punch. Can you teach me how to fight?}
{156}{}{你真的知道怎么出拳。你能教我怎么打架吗？}
#{157}{}{See you around.}
{157}{}{回头见。}
#{158}{}{More questions? I'm not hanging around here for conversation, you know.}
{158}{}{还有问题吗？我不是在这里闲逛聊天的，你知道的。}
#{159}{}{Don??t yell in my ear. My reflexes may get the better of me.}
{159}{}{别在我耳边大喊大叫。我的反应也许会好起来。}
#{160}{}{Where do I start? The chems, the whores, or the gangsters? Look, there's a boxing outfit in New Reno. If you're good enough, you can fight to the death in the ring and make a lot of money on gambles. I used to do it, but I got banned... Whatever, it's a long story.}
{160}{}{我从哪里开始？化学品，妓女，还是黑帮？看，在新雷诺有一套拳击装备。如果你足够优秀，你可以在拳击场上战斗至死，在赌博中赚很多钱。我以前是这么做的，但是我被禁止了...不管怎样，说来话长。}
#{161}{}{New Reno? Where's that?}
{161}{}{新雷诺？在哪里？}
#{162}{}{You've never been to Reno? Just go south on the highway. But keep your gun ready, there's a lot of bandits on the way.}
{162}{}{你从没去过雷诺？在高速公路上往南走。但你要准备好枪，路上有很多强盗。}
#{163}{}{Teach you? [he shakes his head] Maybe if you were some little guy I would help you out, but you don't need it.}
{163}{}{教你？[他摇摇头]也许如果你是个小家伙，我会帮你，但你不需要。}
#{164}{}{Teach you? [he shakes his head] I would, but what if you're some raider or other scumbag? I don't deal with those types.}
{164}{}{教你？[他摇摇头]我会的，但如果你是袭击者或其他人渣呢？我不跟那些人打交道。}
#{165}{}{Teach you? [he shakes his head] I would, but the locals aren't too fond of me already. Sorry, nothing personal.}
{165}{}{教你？[他摇摇头]我会的，但是当地人已经不太喜欢我了。对不起，没有私人问题。}
#{166}{}{Teach you? Hell, why not? I'm no coach, but I can show you a few moves. I won't do it for free, though.}
{166}{}{教你？见鬼，为什么不呢？我不是教练，但我可以教你一些动作。不过，我不会免费的。}
#{167}{}{Teach you? Hell, why not? I'm no coach, but I can show you a few moves. No charge, just 'cuz I like you. [he winks and grins]}
{167}{}{教你？见鬼，为什么不呢？我不是教练，但我可以教你一些动作。不收费，只是因为我喜欢你。[他眨眼笑了]}
#{168}{}{Is two hundred dollars enough?}
{168}{}{两百美元够吗？}
#{169}{}{You're a good guy, Mike! Let's not waste any more time...}
{169}{}{你是个好人，迈克！我们不要再浪费时间了...}
#{170}{}{That'll do. Give me the money and I'll spend a couple of hours showing you the basics.}
{170}{}{那就行了。把钱给我，我会花几个小时给你看基本的东西。}
#{171}{}{Good. Let??s do this...}
{171}{}{很好。让我们这样做...}
#{172}{}{Not today.}
{172}{}{今天不行。}
#{173}{}{Mike raised your unarmed skill by 3%.}
{173}{}{迈克把你的徒手技能提高了3%。}
#{180}{}{Something tells me you didn't travel all the way here with just your bare hands.}
{180}{}{告诉我你不是光手一路来的。}
#{181}{}{Right. Even I can't fight my way up the highway with just my boxing gloves. Thankfully, I knew a guy who knew a guy who could get me a power fist before I left. Best unarmed weapon you'll ever see, but damnedest thing - you can't get batteries for it here. Now that I'm here, it's useless.}
{181}{}{正确的。即使是我也不能光靠拳击手套在公路上奋力拼搏。谢天谢地，我认识一个人，他认识一个能在我离开前给我一个强力拳的人。你见过的最好的手无寸铁的武器，但最可恶的是，你不能在这里得到电池。既然我来了，那就没用了。}
#{182}{}{I want to buy that power fist from you.}
{182}{}{我想从你那里买一个强力拳。}
#{183}{}{Right. Well, good luck then.}
{183}{}{正确的。好吧，祝你好运。}
#{184}{}{Hmm. It's not doing me much good here. But it cost me a fortune! I won't sell it cheap.}
{184}{}{嗯。这对我没什么好处。但这花了我一大笔钱！我不会贱卖的。}
#{185}{}{How much?}
{185}{}{多少？}
#{186}{}{3500 bucks ought to cover it.}
{186}{}{3500美元应该够了。}
#{187}{}{Are you out of your mind? Who's going to pay that kind of money? I'll give you 2500 dollars, and that's out of respect.}
{187}{}{你疯了吗？谁来付那笔钱？我给你2500美元，这是出于尊重。}
#{188}{}{It's pricey, but I'll take it!}
{188}{}{很贵，但我要买！}
#{189}{}{Too rich for my blood. Some other time maybe.}
{189}{}{对我的血液来说太丰富了。也许改天吧。}
#{190}{}{Money up front, wanderer. No offense, but I don't trust easy.}
{190}{}{钱在前面，流浪者。无意冒犯，但我不相信易。}
#{191}{}{I'll be back with the cash.}
{191}{}{我会带着现金回来的。}
#{192}{}{What, are you going to offer me some colored beads next? Try that shit in Lovelock, not on me. I'm from the city, I know what this shit is worth.}
{192}{}{什么，你接下来要给我一些彩色珠子吗？在Lovelock试试那玩意，别在我身上。我是城里人，我知道这玩意值多少钱。}
#{193}{}{Fine. Here 3500 dollars.}
{193}{}{好的。给你3500美元。}
#{194}{}{Suit yourself. Good luck finding a buyer up here.}
{194}{}{随便你。祝你在这里找到买家。}
#{195}{}{Hmm... That's still a lot of money. You've got a deal.}
{195}{}{Hmm...那还是一大笔钱。你说定了。}
#{196}{}{Great, I've got the cash.}
{196}{}{太好了，我有现金。}
#{197}{}{Maybe not today.}
{197}{}{也许今天不行。}
#{198}{}{[He looks at the power fist morosely and takes your money] Farewell, my friend. We've been through a lot...}
{198}{}{[他闷闷不乐地看着权力拳头，拿走了你的钱]再见，我的朋友。我们经历了很多...}
#{199}{}{Stop crying and give it me!}
{199}{}{别哭了，给我！}
#{200}{}{You'll feel better in the morning.}
{200}{}{明天早上你会感觉好些的。}
#{1110}{}{[He raises one eyebrow] You ever held a golf ball, girl? With one hit, you can take a 90-pound midget's head clean off from 300 yards...}
{1110}{}{你拿过高尔夫球吗，姑娘？只要一拳，你就能把一个90磅重的侏儒的头从300码外干掉...}
#{1113}{}{[He rolls his eyes] I'm bored with you, girl. Leave.}
{1113}{}{我受够你了，姑娘。离开。}
#{1133}{}{Nah, this ain't like that. Back in the ring, death was just something that happened, but hereabouts I don't want to hear people saying "Oh, there's Mike, he beats people to death for talking to him."}
{1133}{}{不是这样的。回到拳击场，死亡只是发生过的事情，但在这附近我不想听到人们说“哦，迈克，他因为和他说话而把人打得要死。”}
#{1163}{}{Teach you? [he shakes his head] Maybe, if you were some little snot, I would help you out, but you don't need it.}
{1163}{}{教你？[他摇摇头]也许，如果你是个小鼻涕虫，我会帮你，但你不需要。}
#{1190}{}{Money up front, wanderer. No offense, but I don't trust easy.}
{1190}{}{钱在前面，流浪者。无意冒犯，但我不相信易。}
