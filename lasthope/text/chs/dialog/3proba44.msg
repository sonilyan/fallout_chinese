### {100}{}{Hello. You are new here, right?}
{100}{}{你好你是新来的，对吧？}
### {101}{}{Yup, what do you do here?}
{101}{}{是的，你在这里做什么？}
### {102}{}{Who are you?}
{102}{}{你是谁？}
### {103}{}{Yes, and... see you later.}
{103}{}{是的，而且。。。回头见。}
### {104}{}{You want to talk about something?}
{104}{}{你想谈谈什么吗？}
### {105}{}{Yup, what do you do here?}
{105}{}{是的，你在这里做什么？}
### {106}{}{Who are you?}
{106}{}{你是谁？}
### {107}{}{Not right now.}
{107}{}{现在不行。}
### {108}{}{I'm, uh, working here... I remember it had something to do with the ventilation system... If you see any broken air vents, it means I'm still on the job! [He laughs.]}
{108}{}{我在这里工作。。。我记得这和通风系统有关。。。如果你看到通风口坏了，那就意味着我还在工作！[他笑了。]}
### {109}{}{So, what's the story?}
{109}{}{那么，故事是什么呢？}
### {110}{}{Have a nice day. [Leave.]}
{110}{}{祝你今天愉快。[离开。]}
### {111}{}{It's not a story, it's a fact. The administration doesn't have the money to pay for the parts and so we are where we are now. No matter how much time I spend cleaning them, those vents rust and make more mess every time.}
{111}{}{这不是故事，这是事实。政府没有钱支付零件的费用，所以我们现在的处境。不管我花多少时间清洗它们，这些通风口每次都会生锈，弄得更乱。}
### {112}{}{So, rusty vents are giving you a real headache?}
{112}{}{所以，生锈的通风口真的让你头疼吗？}
### {113}{}{You bet. And it's not the only problem. Less fresh air is coming from the surface. When fumes and moisture build up they sometimes form a mist... you can't even see the end of the hall. Some of us were using environmental armors, but those were quickly withdrawn because of expenses. Those bastards from the top figured it's cheaper to keep us down here in this gas chamber than replace the damn air filters...}
{113}{}{当然，这不是唯一的问题。来自地表的新鲜空气越来越少。当烟雾和湿气积聚时，有时会形成薄雾。。。你甚至看不到大厅的尽头。我们中的一些人使用了环保武器，但由于费用原因，这些武器很快就被撤回了。那些来自高层的混蛋认为把我们留在这个毒气室比更换该死的空气过滤器更便宜。。。}
### {114}{}{That means the only way out is raising money for air vent parts?}
{114}{}{这意味着唯一的出路就是筹集资金购买通风口零件？}
### {115}{}{You are damn right about that one. We are in desperate need for money.}
{115}{}{你说得对。我们急需钱。}
### {116}{}{How much money are we talking about?}
{116}{}{我们说的是多少钱？}
### {117}{}{About $5000 if my calculations are right. We just need to replace some filters in the more critical areas. After that the carbon dioxide and other toxic fume levels in the air will drop eventually. Why are you asking?}
{117}{}{如果我的计算正确的话，大约5000美元。我们只需要在更关键的区域更换一些过滤器。之后，空气中的二氧化碳和其他有毒烟雾水平最终会下降。你为什么要问？}
### {118}{}{Maybe I can help you to collect the money.}
{118}{}{也许我可以帮你收钱。}
### {119}{}{I just wanted to know how bad it is. Let me ask you something else.}
{119}{}{我只是想知道情况有多糟。让我问你其他问题。}
### {120}{}{I'm sure you want, like everybody else in here. But guess what, we don't have a dime in our pockets. The administration got all the money. All we get is food, some medications... Enough to survive, but not very generously.}
{120}{}{我相信你愿意，就像这里的其他人一样。但你猜怎么着，我们口袋里一毛钱都没有。政府得到了所有的钱。我们得到的只是食物，一些药物。。。足够生存，但不是很慷慨。}
### {121}{}{I understand and I'll try to get some money.}
{121}{}{我理解，我会设法弄点钱。}
### {122}{}{That would be great! I'll see if I can gather something here. Good luck, you'll need it.}
{122}{}{那太好了！我看看能不能在这里收集点什么。祝你好运，你会需要它的。}
### {123}{}{Thanks.}
{123}{}{谢谢}
### {124}{}{I'm Dave. I work here. I mean, what else can I do here?}
{124}{}{我叫戴夫。我在这里工作。我的意思是，我还能在这里做什么？}
### {125}{}{Nothing, I suppose. Let me ask you something else.}
{125}{}{我想什么都没有。让我再问你一件事。}
### {126}{}{Sure thing. Speak the word.}
{126}{}{当然可以说出这个词。}
### {127}{}{About that money for the vents...}
{127}{}{关于通风口的钱。。。}
### {128}{}{How much do you have?}
{128}{}{你有多少钱？}
### {129}{}{Still not enough, I'm sorry.}
{129}{}{还是不够，对不起。}
### {130}{}{I got $5000 right here. So what's the plan?}
{130}{}{我这里有5000美元。那么计划是什么呢？}
### {131}{}{I managed to collect a little something myself. You give me yours and I'll speak with Leonard at once.}
{131}{}{我设法自己收集了一些东西。你给我你的，我马上和伦纳德谈谈。}
### {132}{}{Alright, here you go.}
{132}{}{好吧，给你。}
### {133}{}{I'm not sure I want to give my money to a stranger.}
{133}{}{我不确定我是否想把钱给陌生人。}
### {134}{}{[You wait for a while and Dave approaches soon after.] Great news I tell you. Leonard was surprised about how we managed to collect so much money and immediately agreed to buy us new parts for those vents. Isn't that great? Within a week or two everybody should be feeling much better. We owe you man. Anything you need, I will help you.}
{134}{}{[你等了一会儿，戴夫很快就来了。]我告诉你一个好消息。Leonard对我们如何筹集到这么多钱感到惊讶，并立即同意为我们购买这些通风口的新零件。这不是很棒吗？一两周内，每个人都会感觉好多了。我们欠你的，伙计。你需要什么，我都会帮你。}
### {135}{}{Thanks. I was glad to help.}
{135}{}{谢谢我很乐意帮忙。}
### {136}{}{No offense, but we are all in the same hole. Suit yourself.}
{136}{}{无意冒犯，但我们都在同一个洞里。随你便。}
### {137}{}{[Leave.]}
{137}{}{[离开]}
### {138}{}{I'm doing just fine, friend. As I promised, I offer you my help whenever you need it. So, can I do something for you?}
{138}{}{我做得很好，朋友。正如我所承诺的，只要你需要，我都会为你提供帮助。那么，我能为你做点什么吗？}
