### {280}{}{I'm trying to free my relatives from the pen.}
{280}{}{我正试图把我的亲戚从笔下解放出来。}
### {281}{}{Were they enslaved too? Faber's people are getting bolder every day. Previously, they forced only criminals to work, and now they enslave innocent citizens.}
{281}{}{他们也被奴役了吗？费伯的人一天比一天大胆。以前，他们只强迫罪犯工作，现在他们奴役无辜的公民。}
### {282}{}{What about weapons? You're not going to shoot, are you?}

#Traps
### {310}{}{Show me your traps, otherwise I won't get out of here.}
{310}{}{给我看看你的陷阱，否则我就出不去了。}
### {311}{}{Either fools or traitors ask for this. I'm alive because of this secret, and you're asking me to reveal it.}

{336}{}{你一个人在这里吗？}
### {337}{}{It is more profitable to act alone in Flagstaff. It's easier to avoid mercenaries this way.}
{337}{}{在弗拉格斯塔夫单独行动更有利可图。这样更容易避开雇佣兵。}
### {338}{}{I don't think that only one ranger was sent to eliminate an entire gang.}
{338}{}{我不认为只有一个护林员被派去消灭整个帮派。}

### {409}{}{The colonists also maintain law and order.}
{409}{}{殖民者也维护法律和秩序。}

### {480}{}{Faber is dead. Is that enough for you?}
{480}{}{费伯死了。这对你来说够了吗？}
### {481}{}{So is it true? (inhales noisily and pauses) You know, I don't feel anything about this. It seemed to me that having eradicated evil, I would find peace. But now I finally understand. A new one will take the place of one Faber. And so it will continue again and again... Because people don't change. The General was right when he said I was possessed. Thanks for the help. I have to get back to base.}
{481}{}{那么这是真的吗？（大声吸气，停顿了一下）你知道，我对此没有任何感觉。在我看来，铲除了邪恶，我会找到平静。但现在我终于明白了。一个新的将取代一个Faber。因此，它将一次又一次地继续。。。因为人们不会改变。将军说我走火入魔是对的。谢谢你的帮助。我必须回到基地。}
### {482}{}{Ugh, it's good that we solved this issue.}
{482}{}{啊，我们解决了这个问题真是太好了。}
### {483}{}{Yeah, go ahead.}
{483}{}{是的，继续吧。}
