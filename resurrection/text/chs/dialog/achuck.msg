{950}{}{哦，费利克斯简直就是个蜜罐子。我们本来可以在一起度过一段美好的时光的，可他居然毁了这一切，而且还试图逃跑！那我可就不得不给他点颜色看看了。你看，就算不为了别的，也是为了他人。我可没想把他弄的那么惨，但他一直在反抗，是他逼我这么做的…我们甚至没有得到任何乐趣。}
#{951}{}{What are you talking about? What happened to him?}
{951}{}{你在说什么？他怎么了？}
#{1000}{}{You wanted to have some fun with him? Even if he got himself killed, his body is still mine. Only me and my sweethearts can play with him. They belong to me and me alone!

{1664}{}{我想为马里奥的来访收集瓶盖。}
#{1700}{}{I don't wanna stick it somewhere that's already had plenty. Just admit what a little bitch you are, he, he.}
{1700}{}{我不想把它放在有很多东西的地方。承认你是个小贱人吧，呵，呵。}
#{1701}{}{Big talk, you sure you're not impotent?}
{1701}{}{吹牛，你确定你没有阳痿吗？}
#{1702}{}{Screw you.}
{1702}{}{去你的。}
#{1750}{}{Enough! I'll show you what a whore you are, you'll beg me to fuck you harder. Now get down to the cellar, on all fours...}
{1750}{}{够了！我会让你看看你是个什么样的婊子，你会求我更用力地操你。现在到地下室去，趴下，四肢着地…}
#{1751}{}{[Obey him.]}
{1751}{}{[服从他。]}
#{1752}{}{Easy there, I was just kidding.}
{1752}{}{别紧张，我只是开玩笑。}
#{1800}{}{[Chuck ties you up in the cellar and a furiously violates you. He makes the imprisoned boys watch it all. Judging by their empty stares, they must've been forced to take part in even more brutal acts. Chuck then takes you back to the shop and throws you the gag that you had the opportunity to get closely acquainted with minutes ago.] Here's a souvenir for you, bitch, so you don't forget your place.}
{1800}{}{[查克在地下室里把你五花大绑之后狠狠地侵犯了你。他让被囚禁的孩子们亲眼目睹着这一切。从孩子们空洞的眼神来看，他们一定是被迫参与了更残酷的行为。性虐结束后，查克带你回到商店，把几分钟前你最熟悉的那块塞口球丢给了你。]这是给你的纪念品，贱人，这样你就不会忘记自己的地位了。}

#{1802}{}{[Leave.]}
{1802}{}{[离开。]}
#{1850}{}{I said you're a whore that I'm going to fuck. Dead or alive. [He pulls out a pistol.]}
{1850}{}{我说你是个妓女，我要干你，不同意就得死。[他掏出一把手枪。]}
#{1851}{}{[Defend yourself.]}
{1851}{}{[为自己辩护。]}
#{1900}{}{Women... You're all rotten right from birth. Disgusting! You should have all your holes cauterized with searing iron.}
{1900}{}{女人... 你从一出生就堕落了。真恶心！你应该用烙铁把你所有的洞都烫焦。}
#{1901}{}{I think I'd better leave.}
{1901}{}{我想我最好离开。}
#{1902}{}{Would that turn you on, honey?}
{1902}{}{这会让你兴奋吗，亲爱的？}
#{1950}{}{Oh my, a poor simpleton. I bet you want to buy yourself a nice gun, he, he.}
{1950}{}{哦，我的天，一个可怜的傻瓜。我猜你想给自己买把好枪，呵，呵。}
#{1951}{}{Oh my, a poor simpleton. I bet you want to buy yourself a nice gun, he, he.}

#{1952}{}{Yaaah!}
{1952}{}{耶！}
#{1953}{}{Nuh.}
{1953}{}{不。}
#{2000}{}{He won't resist one bit? We'll see about that. But it could make for a nice change. What do you want in return for sending your sweetheart to me? I'll give you 400 caps for each time he visits me, as longs as he's as sweet as his name.}
{2000}{}{他真的一点都不反抗？我们走着瞧吧。但这可能是一个很好的改变。你把你的宝贝送给我，想要什么回报？只要他来我这儿一次，我就给你400瓶盖，只要他像他的名字一样甜美。}
#{2001}{}{He won't resist one bit? We'll see about that. But it could make for a nice change. What do you want in return for sending your sweetheart to me? I'll give you 400 caps for each time he visits me, as longs as he's as sweet as his name.}

#{2002}{}{The boy is worth more. He'll do anything for drugs. And I do mean anything. I want 500 caps per visit.}
{2002}{}{这孩子更值钱。他会为毒品做任何事，任何事都可以。每次我想要500瓶盖。}
#{2003}{}{That's a fair price. You have yourself a deal.}
{2003}{}{这个价格很公道。成交。}
#{2050}{}{Alright, send him to me then. I'll show him both exquisite pleasure and excruciating pain. Don't worry, I know he's yours. so I'll have your caps ready after each visit.}
{2050}{}{好吧，那就把他交给我。我会让他知道什么是极致的快乐和极度的痛苦。别担心，我知道他是你的。所以每次拜访之后我都会把你的瓶盖准备好。}
#{2051}{}{We'll see.}
{2051}{}{我们拭目以待。}
#{2100}{}{I've already paid you for the sweetheart's last visit. He hasn't been here since. But he'll be back, he can't help himself, he he.}
{2100}{}{我已经付你甜心最后一次来访的钱了。从那以后他就没来过这里。但他会回来的，他控制不了自己，呵呵。}
#{2101}{}{Oh, my bad then, sorry.}
{2101}{}{哦，那是我的错，抱歉。}
#{2150}{}{That Mario of yours is such a dear. He just wants his fix so much, he, he. He's worth every single cap. Here you go [Chuck gives you }
{2150}{}{你的马里奥真是太可爱了。他太容易得到他想要的了，嘿，嘿。他值得每枚瓶盖。给你[查克给你 ]}
#{2151}{}{ caps.]}
{2151}{}{ 瓶盖。]}
#{2152}{}{Pleasure doing business with you, Chuck.}
{2152}{}{很高兴和你做生意，查克。}
#{2200}{}{Can't get enough of her looks? [He laughs, then rummages below the counter for a while, pulls out the pistol and puts it in front of you.] As I've said, hot goods straight from the empire. I clearly remember that we agreed on }
{2200}{}{受不了她这副模样了？[他笑了，然后在柜台下面翻了一会儿，掏出手枪放在你面前。]就像我说的，这可是帝国的抢手货。我清楚地记得我们说好了的 }
#{2201}{}{ caps.}
{2201}{}{ 瓶盖。}
#{2202}{}{If the pistol is such hot goods, I'm sure you'll gladly get rid of her for 8000 caps too, no? You wouldn't want to get in trouble with the empire.}
{2202}{}{如果这把手枪这么抢手，我相信你也会很乐意用8000个瓶盖把她带走的，不是吗？你不会想惹上帝国的麻烦的。}
#{2203}{}{It's a nice pistol, yeah, but I can't exactly brag about it to anyone. I probably couldn't even use it in and around Albuquerque because it could get me in trouble with the empire. So I think that, say, 10000 caps would be a more appropriate price.}
{2203}{}{这是把不错的手枪，没错，但我不能向任何人炫耀。我甚至不能在阿尔伯克基和附近使用它，因为它会给我惹上帝国的麻烦。所以我想，这么说吧，10000个瓶盖可能是个更合适的价格。}
#{2204}{}{That was indeed the deal. Here's your money. [Pay.]}
{2204}{}{这才像笔交易。这是你的钱。[支付。]}
#{2205}{}{That's too much for me.}
{2205}{}{这对我来说太贵了。}
#{2206}{}{I think it'll be cheaper to just kill you.}
{2206}{}{我觉得直接杀了你会更省钱。}
#{2250}{}{You worry about the empire too much. But alright, if it'll calm you down, I'll give you the pistol for cheaper. Give me }
{2250}{}{你太担心帝国了。好吧，如果能让你冷静下来，我就以更便宜的价格把枪给你。给我 }
#{2251}{}{ caps and she's all yours.}
{2251}{}{ 瓶盖和它都是你的。}
#{2252}{}{Here they are. [Pay.]}
{2252}{}{东西在这儿。[支付。]}
#{2253}{}{That's still too much for me, to tell the truth.}
{2253}{}{说实话，这对我来说还是太贵了。}
#{2254}{}{I think killing you would be even cheaper.}
{2254}{}{我觉得直接杀了你会更省钱。}
#{2450}{}{My, you're in luck, I have one tugged away here. [He rummages below the counter for a while, then pulls out a pistol and puts it in front of you.] A contact of mine in the imperial army gave her to me. Check out the big, chubby design. [He strokes the pistol.] Someone must've gotten carried away a bit while designing her, he, he. It doesn't look too practical, but who knows. I haven't had the chance to test her out yet, it's hot goods. The empire doesn't like seeing its guns in foreign hands.}
{2450}{}{天哪，你真幸运，我这里正好有一个。[他在柜台下面翻了一会儿，然后掏出一把手枪放在你面前。]我在帝国军里的一个熟人把它给了我。看看这又大又胖的设计。[他挥动手枪。]设计它的人制造它时一定是嗑多了，呵，呵。这玩意看起来不太实用，但谁知道呢。我还没机会试一试，这可是抢手货。帝国不喜欢看到自己的枪落入外国人之手。}
#{2451}{}{My, you're in luck, I have one tugged away here. [He rummages below the counter for a while, then pulls out a pistol and puts it in front of you.] Zack gave her to me.

#{2452}{}{How much do you want for her?}
{2452}{}{你想要多少钱？}
#{2500}{}{For 8000 you can do anything you want with her, she'll be all yours.}
{2500}{}{8000块它就是你的了，你可以拿它做任何你想做的事。}
#{2501}{}{For 10000 you can do anything you want with her, she'll be all yours.}

{2550}{}{很高兴和你做生意，呵，呵。祝你和小胖子玩得开心。[他把手枪给你。]}
#{2551}{}{Thanks.}
{2551}{}{谢谢。}
#{2600}{}{[He puts the pistol somewhere below the counter again.] As you wish, at least I won't have to say goodbye to her yet, he, he.}
{2600}{}{[他又把手枪放在柜台下面的某个地方。]如你所愿，至少我还不用它说再见，呵，呵。}
#{2601}{}{Farewell.}
{2601}{}{再见。}
#{2700}{}{Is that all you wanted? There's no such thing as enough firepower, he, he.}
{2700}{}{这就是你想要的吗？这火力可不太行啊，呵，呵。}
#{2701}{}{Is that all you wanted? There's no such thing as enough firepower, he, he.}
{2701}{}{这就是你想要的吗？这火力可不太行啊，呵，呵。}
#{2702}{}{Show me again what you have, then.}
{2702}{}{再给我看看你有什么。}
#{2703}{}{I'm actually looking for a special kind of a weapon. The YK 32 pulse pistol.}

#{2706}{}{Zachary Browman sent me to you. He said you might have some information...}
{2706}{}{扎卡里・勃劳曼让我来找你的。他说你这里可能知道些什么...}
#{2707}{}{I want to know what you have to do with Zachary Browman. I know there's something between you.}
{2707}{}{我想知道你和扎卡里・勃劳曼有什么关系。我知道你们有些见不得人的东西。}
#{2708}{}{Chuck, you can handle little boys, but you wouldn't do it with a real man like me, huh?}
{2708}{}{查克，你也就欺负欺负小孩子，但你对付不了像我这样的真男人，嗯哼？}
#{2709}{}{Chuck, you can handle little boys, but you're not man enough to do it with a woman like me, huh?}
{2709}{}{查克，你也就欺负欺负小孩子，但你不够男人，不能对付像我这样的女人，嗯哼？}
#{2710}{}{I know about an innocent sweetheart that would do anything for you for drugs. He wouldn't resist you the slightest. His name is Mario.}
{2710}{}{我知道有一个天真的甜心会为了毒品为你做任何事。 他可是十分顺从。 他叫马里奥。}
#{2711}{}{That will be all, goodbye.}
{2711}{}{就这样吧，再见。}
#{2712}{}{I want to collect the caps for Mario's visits.}
{2712}{}{我想为马里奥的来访收集瓶盖。}
#{2750}{}{I told you I don't want them here anymore. I can almost smell the taint... Take them away. [He gives you back the bag with remains of the killed boys.]}
{2750}{}{我告诉过你，我不想让他们留在这里。我几乎能闻到腐臭的味道…把他们拿走。[他把装有被杀男孩尸体的袋子还给你。]}
