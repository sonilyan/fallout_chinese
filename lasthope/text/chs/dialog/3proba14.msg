{100}{}{Want to the other side?}
{101}{}{Yes, it's time to get going.}
{102}{}{Not yet.}
#
{103}{}{Hello again, want me to clear the gate for you?}
{104}{}{Yes, thanks.}
{105}{}{Not yet.}
#
{106}{}{Just put your weapon away, for safety reasons.}
{107}{}{No problem.}
#
{108}{}{You can't leave, you haven't completed your task.}
{109}{}{Alright.}
{110}{}{Let me out now!}
#
{111}{}{Sorry, I can't let you out. Wait the whole day if you like. [Laughs.] Hahaha... I've got plenty of time.}
{112}{}{[Leave.]}
#power off line...
{113}{}{Hold it right there! You have five seconds to state your business or get lost!}
{114}{}{The administrator is expecting me, I have to see him immediately.}
{115}{}{I have to talk to the administrator, it's really important.}
{116}{}{Sorry, my mistake.}
#
{117}{}{I don't know anything about that... What for?}
{118}{}{I have to tell him myself.}
{119}{}{He asked me to deliver certain items.}
{120}{}{... to talk about his men and how incompetent they are!}
{121}{}{That's not your damn business.}
#myself...
{122}{}{No! You tell me now and I'll pass on the message!}
{123}{}{Well, screw you!}
{124}{}{How about you shut your fucking mouth and let me in!?}
#items...
{125}{}{Right, hand them over and I'll check with him. So, what have you got?}
{126}{}{You won't like what I've got but I'll show it to you anyway...}
{127}{}{Hey! I have a bullet with your name on it. You want it!?}
#
{128}{}{I have money, I can pay if you let me in.}
#
{129}{}{Guess what, pal? Your money is not welcome here! I'll count to one and then there will be hell to pay...}
{130}{}{Give me your best shot!}
{131}{}{Great, I'll get in for free then.}
#
{132}{}{I've captured one of the fugitives, his name is Scott.}
#
{133}{}{[He looks surprised.] How did you...? Nevermind, that really is Scott! This is a big one, I should inform Mr.
 James about this...}
{134}{}{Wait, there's no need... He's expecting me.}
{135}{}{You better stay here and guard your post. I'll bring Scott to Mr. James personally.}
{136}{}{Forget it! It was my job to bring him and now you want to take all the credit for it? I'm gone.}
#expect...
{137}{}{Why didn't you say so... I'll clear the gate for you. Hurry up, don't make Mr. James wait!}
{138}{}{I won't, thanks...}
#stay here...
{139}{}{Hah, don't worry, we got enough guards watching. Say, why don't we all go to Mr. James office, I want to
 hear what he has to say.}
{140}{}{Well, alright.}
#
{141}{}{Mr. James is waiting.}
{142}{}{I'm not the one you should be talking to.}
#security codes
{143}{}{The administrator sent me to pick up your security codes. He thinks they might be compromised and doesn't
 want to take any chances. New orders will follow.}
#pass, speech roll 75 check (changed to 30)
{144}{}{Are you serious!? When did this order come in, why did no one tell me... [vigorously shaking his radio]... is
 this even working!? I don't believe it, he checks on me every five minutes a damn fly buzzes by but doesn't inform me
 about this... what is this clown-shit!?}
{145}{}{Uh... OK, whenever you're ready.}
#
{146}{}{[Hands you the codes.] Take the damn codes! But somebody better answer for this!}
{147}{}{Yep, and it's you, asshole! I'm gonna tell the administrator about your attitude, lack of cooperation and
 ignorance regarding security detail. A nice day to you, *sir*.}
{148}{}{Thanks.}
#fail, speech roll 75 check (changed to 30)
{149}{}{What!? This is highly irregular! [Studies you a bit closer.] Wait a minute... I remember you. You're part of the
 scum we've got holed up here, and the administrator chose to send... you!? You'd be dead meat if Mr. James didn't
 made you his personal pet *for some reason*. [He smirks.] You've got no authority here, get the hell out of my sight,
 prisoner.}
{150}{}{Is that so!? Fine, I'll report this, and once they've sorted out the paperwork, I come back and have you relieved
 of your duty! Scum, indeed...}
{151}{}{Whatever, see if I care.}
#new gate pass dialogue if check fails...
{152}{}{[Frowns.] You again? Still walking I see... keep it up.}
{153}{}{Yeah, sure. Open the gate.}
{154}{}{You just wait, I ain't done yet.}
#codes stolen, working for Scott
{155}{}{What!? The codes... I... [He can't seem to find the codes.] Wait a second... what's going on here! No one move
 or leave the area. [Talks into his radio.] Security breach. Lock down area. [Back to you.] As for you, I'll have to search
 you, this is serious, you better start stripping down now.}
{156}{}{Over my dead body.}
