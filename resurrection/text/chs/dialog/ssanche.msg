#{1054}{}{Later-er.}
{1054}{}{晚点再问。}

#{1150}{}{Good. I'm in need of an extra pair of hands for a bodyguarding job right now. We're expecting sheriff's deputy Tyler Morrow in a few minutes. I'm holding a meeting with him. Your job is to stand where I tell you and keep your mouth shut. You act only when I tell you or if Morrow tries anything.}
{1150}{}{很好。我现在需要一双额外的手来做保镖的工作。几分钟后我们就要等副警长泰勒・莫罗了。我要和他开会。你的工作就是站在我告诉你的地方闭嘴。你只有在我告诉你的时候或者在明天有任何尝试的时候才行动。}
#{1151}{}{OK.}
{1151}{}{好 啊。}

#{1700}{}{That place's frequently messy, the town council forced Carpenter to do his job at least once. He had to place capable people there. It was a miracle he found any.}
{1700}{}{那个地方经常乱七八糟，市议会至少强迫卡彭特干过一次活。他不得不在那里安置能干的人。他发现了一个奇迹。}
#{1701}{}{So everybody'll be after me when I'm finished?}
{1701}{}{所以当我结束的时候大家都会跟着我？}
#{1750}{}{That's life, amigo. If you don't kill any cops, we'll make sure they leave you alone, once things have calmed down. All you have to do is stay out of town for three months and you'll be alright. That doesn't apply to our beloved Lost Town, naturally.}
{1750}{}{这就是生活，朋友。如果你不杀任何警察，等事情平息下来，我们会确保他们不会打扰你。你只要在外面呆三个月就没事了。当然，这不适用于我们深爱的失落小镇。}

#{2003}{}{I won't forget it, see you.}
{2003}{}{我不会忘记的，再见。}
#{2050}{}{No, Senor doesn't need anything from you right now. If you're loco, crazy enough, you can try fistfighting with wild animals. Just find a big man with lotsa tattoos standing next to the ring. His name's Cristos and he's in charge of the fights.}
{2050}{}{不，先生现在不需要你的任何东西。如果你是本地人，足够疯狂，你可以尝试与野生动物打架。只要找到一个大男人站在戒指旁边。他叫克里斯托斯，负责打斗。}
