{100}{}{Welcome, stranger. This is my office. So, have a seat and tell me, what can I do for you?}
{101}{}{I would like to know who am I speaking with, if you don't mind?}
{102}{}{What's your job here?}
{103}{}{Nothing at the moment.}
#
{104}{}{Is there something else I can help you with?}
#Who are you?
{105}{}{You sound just like those typical business people I work with from time to time, always negotiating, nothing
 to offer. You never want to hear the bad part. [Smiles.] Anyway, the name is Leonard, one of the power plant owners.}
{106}{}{You own some of it... it must be worth a fortune. Can you tell me more about it?}
{107}{}{Thanks, let me ask you something else.}
#tell me?
{108}{}{This power plant is very old, not just by the looks of it. Built before I was born, even before the war, I think.
 Nobody really knows its age because most of the records were lost. Our research showed it's clearly early 21th century
 technology even though we couldn't make out any label on the metal plates, they were badly damaged by rust. She's old
 but works like a charm. [Smiles.]}
{109}{}{Is it safe to work in a power plant as old as that?}
{110}{}{Don't you think it's been working for too long already?}
#is it safe.
{111}{}{Of course. We have maintenance checks every week. If some parts needs to be replaced, they are within a few
 hours. You see, even though the technology hasn't improved over the years, our understanding of it did. So, it all comes
 down to daily routine, nothing for you to worry about.}
{112}{}{If you say so. Let me ask you something else.}
#to many years...
{113}{}{Well, I don't. I'm aware of the risk, but the power plant is working smoothly, no problems whatsoever. If,
 hypothetically speaking, some drastic problem were to occur, safety measures would be undertaken to prevent any
 threat to the population or the environment.}
{114}{}{Looks like you got that covered. Let me ask you something else.}
#what do you do here...
{115}{}{I do most of the administration work, trading of goods and power generator parts. }
{116}{}{What can you tell me about your administration work?}
{117}{}{Trading of goods and parts?}
{118}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
#administration work...
{119}{}{Power plant maintenance schedules, taking care of the workers. In fact, everything related to the power
 plant, inside or out. You would be surprised how many jobs are there in administration. It's not an easy task, but I
 always get the job done. Not because I have plenty of time, but because of my will and the manpower to do it. Like
 every successful enterprise, with capable management and expense cuttings, this one also turned out profitable.}
{120}{}{What about trading goods?}
{121}{}{Thanks for the info. Let me ask you something else.}
{122}{}{I'm glad you take your job so seriously. See you around.}
#trading goods...
{123}{}{Mostly I arrange ore sales. Some parts for the power plant, when it's needed, and some rare metals.}
{124}{}{Do you sell uranium ore?}
{125}{}{What rare metals?}
{126}{}{Thanks for the info. Let me ask you something else.}
#uranium...
{127}{}{We do, but only to old customers that have an established reputation. We actually have a fair amount of
 uranium ore supplies. I know you are asking yourself "how is that possible", but you see, we were fortunate enough to
 close a "once in a lifetime" deal with our supplier. This was an excellent opportunity to earn some funds and expand
 our market further south. By selling some of the uranium reserves we gain reputation, but there is also a downside.}
{128}{}{Such as?}
#
{129}{}{Because of our customers demands, we often send very large shipments to their towns.
 And all that crowd draws too much attention, which brings uninvited guests.}
{130}{}{Go on.}
#
{131}{}{Bandits are causing far more trouble nowadays. They are like vultures. Circling whenever they "smell" a good
 opportunity for looting. Until all of them are dead, the danger never stops. These "little wars" took a too heavy toll on
 our ranks to be ignored much longer. So we have to wait for the situation to calm down... Which leaves us waiting and
 losing money, which is again a different kind of problem we have to deal with. We even lost a few customers because
 the delivery failed to meet the agreed deadlines, sometimes for a week. It's a real disaster if you ask me.}
{132}{}{What are you going to do?}
#
{133}{}{Solution might be simple, we need help for guarding our shipments. Our hands are tied now because of the
 situation, but with additional "reinforcements" we could make some progress and start selling ore again. I need your
 opinion about this, stranger. Or even better, could you do something for us?}
{134}{}{Sure, what's on your mind?}
{135}{}{Nope, not right now.}
#nope...
{136}{}{I understand it's not an easy decision. If you change your mind, your help would be more than welcome.}
{137}{}{Alright.}
#sure...
{138}{}{Good. Here's what you need to do. Hit the road to Farmers Town. There's an organization called "Stockman's
 Association". You need to talk with them and see if they are interested in helping us guarding our shipments. If they
 agree, we are willing to negotiate about payments and other terms. If you make this happen, [smiles] expect your
 payment as well.}
{139}{}{Fair enough. I'll see what I can do.}
#rare metals...
{140}{}{All kinds of it. From gold, still one of the precious metals that has good value on the markets but also the most
 common, to platinum or titanium. After the war, the industry totally went to pieces. We don't make cars or airplanes
 anymore, instead weapons have become humanity's new obsession like we don't have enough trouble with the lack of
 resources and poverty all around.}
{141}{}{There is hope however...}
#
{142}{}{You're right. We are trying to make a difference for the sake of this city and I'm sure we will see it through.}
{143}{}{Alright, let me ask you something else.}
#
{144}{}{About that job?}
#
{145}{}{Are you going to help us?}
{146}{}{That's why I'm here. Tell me what has to be done.}
{147}{}{Not yet.}
#
{148}{}{Do you have some good news for me?}
{149}{}{Sure, "Stockman's" will help you. And whenever you want, you can go there to discuss the business details.}
{150}{}{Still nothing, sorry.}
#
{151}{}{Good news indeed, thanks stranger. I guess some money will satisfy your needs. I'll return to my business
 then.}
{152}{}{Thanks.}
#
{153}{}{Do you have some uranium for sale?}
#uranium for sale...
{154}{}{Not yet, come back in three days or so when our first shipment should arrive at its destination. We have to
 check our shipment progress before any further arrangements can be made.}
{155}{}{OK. Later then.}
#
{156}{}{Yes. We are back in business and ready to go. Say, what do you need uranium for?}
{157}{}{[You smile.] I don't plan to use it, way too dangerous, but the man who hired me does. His mane is Aston,
 from Golden Valley.}
{158}{}{Well, if you really want to know, I'm making firecrackers. Um, for kids, you know. See, nothing special. Just
 sell me some uranium.}
#for kids...
{159}{}{Sorry stranger, it's a nice story though. I'm sure kids these days don't play with small nuclear firecrackers.
 [Smiles.] Not to mention they could blow up the entire neighborhood. This fine ore is just for industrial
 exploitation, it'll stay that way for the time being.}
{160}{}{I thought you would say that. I'm out of here.}
{161}{}{I'll have to disagree. I'm gonna get that uranium by myself!}
#for Aston...
{162}{}{All right. But it would be better if your employer visits me personally because I have to know specific details
 about the shipment. There's a request form, here [hands you some papers], so he can have enough time to read about
 the required procedures for this transaction. Everything else will be discussed when I meet him.}
{163}{}{OK, I'll tell him.}
#
{164}{}{Welcome back stranger. Is there something I can help you with?}
#
{165}{}{Do we have plasma transformers in our stock?}
#
{166}{}{Why on earth do you need a plasma transformer? You know those things can explode like a hand grenade if
 you drop them?}
{167}{}{Lenny the scientist told me to get a new one immediately. And I'm not that clumsy, just so you know.}
#
{168}{}{In that case, [smiles] let me see... no, we don't have that part. Looks like you'll have to wait... until new stock
 arrives that is.}
{169}{}{And when will that be, soon I hope?}
#
{170}{}{They are running late, I can tell you that much. It was supposed to come last week but it doesn't depend on
 me. Our supplies come from the west coast. There's a town called Philton, where our supplier is located. This shipment
 is very important, so somebody has to go there and check it out because there's no other way to contact them.}
{171}{}{Huh, no satellites, no phones... damn this post apocalyptic world. I could go there.}
{172}{}{Sorry to hear that. They are probably lost. No big deal, they're grown ups. I'll just come back some other
 time.}
# i could...
{173}{}{It's your call. You know the risks involved. Successfully retrieve that plasma transformer and any information
 about our shipment and I will make sure you get paid properly. How does that sound?}
{174}{}{Good enough. I'm on it.}
#
{175}{}{Can you check that shipment for me?}
{176}{}{Yes. Tell me what I am supposed to do?}
{177}{}{Not just yet.}
#yes...
{178}{}{Go to the city of Philton on the west coast, find out what's going on with my shipment and get that part Lenny
 is looking for. Anything else?}
{179}{}{Nothing more. This should be enough.}
#back with information but no part... alt see 191
{180}{}{Do you have some information for me?}
{181}{}{I've found out some disturbing news... I know this is not what you want to hear but that shipment was
 intercepted by raiders. No survivors I'm afraid... most of the equipment was destroyed or taken. I'm sorry.}
{182}{}{No, I don't.}
#
{183}{}{[Sighs. Then slaps his hand on the table.] God damn it... that wasn't supposed to happen. This is a
 serious setback, those sons of bitches will pay for this. [Gives you some cash.] Here's your reward, you helped me as
 much as you could and I appreciate that.}
{184}{}{Thanks.}
#
{185}{}{About that shipment...}
#
{186}{}{I don't know you, stranger, beat it!}
{187}{}{Get the hell out of my office.}
{188}{}{What do you want!?}
{189}{}{Can't you see I'm busy here.}
{190}{}{Talk to Brian, he may have a job for you.}
#back with information and part... followed by 228
{191}{}{I see you have that part. Do you have any news about our shipment, anything at all?}
{192}{}{Sorry, I don't.}
#
{193}{}{Then don't come back without that information!}
{194}{}{All right.}
#
{195}{}{Yes, you told me about it. Lenny is waiting for you. Go give him that part.}
{196}{}{OK.}
#
{197}{}{You already told me about that... there's nothing more I wish to know. Just try and get Lenny that part
 somehow.}
{198}{}{[Leave.]}
#
{199}{}{Philton needs more power so the mayor's assistant send you this data disc...}
#
{200}{}{Let me see... [Looks worried.] Hm, you know this is just too much. I believe, the plant could support such an
 enormous increase of power output, but that's just theoretical. My engineers would have to roll up their sleeves and do
 some serious calculations and refitting...}
{201}{}{Oh, come on. The plant is old but it's in good shape.}
{202}{}{I guess that wouldn't be enough. I'm out of here.}
{203}{}{Well, can I somehow help to optimize the plant to get that extra power they need?}
#oh come on...
{204}{}{Hey, begging won't solve anything. That would put us in risk of damaging the main reactor or even worse.
 You better step back and let me do my job, alright? The disc stays here so I can analyze the data in more detail and tell
 them personally about my decision. Now, if you may... there's the door.}
{205}{}{Give me back that disc or you'll be sorry!}
{206}{}{[Leave.]}
#help somehow...
{207}{}{[Smiles.] Haha, if you really want to help, you are most certainly welcome. Let me put it this way, that
 amount of energy would require some major repairs to be made and that isn't cheap. My estimation tells me that we're
 talking about roughly $15.000 for the parts. So, is this too much or am I mad?}
{208}{}{I haven't seen so much money in my life... If you excuse me, I'm going now.}
{209}{}{What if I can get some parts for you?}
{210}{}{(I might regret this but...) How about I give you the money and you shut up?}
#some parts...
{211}{}{Hm, that's not a bad idea. If you can get me nine 40-hp motors, for the cooling mechanism and the utility
 crane, you'll save the day. That should be enough to start repairs. I'm going back to my work now, see you later
 then.}
{212}{}{I'll get you those, you'll see.}
#give you money...
{213}{}{What the... that solves all of our problems! Am I glad that finally someone shows up with some real cash and
 a plan how to spend it usefully. [Smiles.] You got it... We'll start right away with the necessary preparations. Philton
 will have as much power as they need.}
{214}{}{I'm glad we made some progress here. We'll stay in touch.}
#
{215}{}{About those parts...}
#
{216}{}{You really got them all... I'm glad you made it. Must have been a tough job, but I can sure tell you that it's
 gonna pay off because those Philton folks are gonna get as much power as they need. I'll order the replacing of those
 motors right away.}
{217}{}{You do that. I'm glad we made some progress here. See you later.}
#
{218}{}{I asked you for nine 40-hp motors and you better bring me those or I'll lose my patience.}
{219}{}{Sure thing.}
#
{220}{}{You already showed me that thing and I don't want it. Do you understand me, stupid?! If I don't see your face
 out of here, I'm gonna shoot you on the spot!}
{221}{}{Empty talk, that's what it is! You're gonna send them more power or I'll do it!}
{222}{}{Yeah, I got you.}
#
{223}{}{All right, we'll see about that. You are so dead, scum!}
{224}{}{In your dreams, pal.}
#
{225}{}{I told you. You have to do a couple of things for me before I can trust you. If you don't like it... then you
 can forget you ever saw me.}
#
{226}{}{We can't just do business because I don't know you. You have to do a couple of things for me before I can
 trust you. If you don't like it... then you can forget you ever saw me.}
{227}{}{All right.}
#
{228}{}{[Sighs. Then slaps his hand on the table.] God damn it... that wasn't supposed to happen. This is a serious
 setback, those sons of bitches will pay for this. [Gives you some cash.] Here's your reward, you helped me as much as
 you could and I appreciate that. Lenny is waiting for you. Go give him that part.}
#29.10.17...waste disposal problem
{229}{}{You have radioactive waste leaking all over the third level! Is anyone doing anything about it?}
#
{230}{}{Where did you get this information? You know that area is off limits to non-authorized personnel?}
{231}{}{Some of the workers are quite worried about it.}
{232}{}{I have military clearance level. Here, check my security card...}
{233}{}{This is the first time I hear about this, no one even warned me I shouldn't go there.}
#workers...
{234}{}{I think you're overreacting about the whole thing. Of course people are worried, but clearly not because of
 something that may happen decades or more from now. More pressing matters is what we really need to worry about,
 don't you agree? [Sighs.] Moreover, having you sniffing around unchecked may cause more damage than the issue
 itself. Consider yourself lucky, I'm only revoking your access to the underground levels. There's the door!}
{235}{}{I actually thought we're going to talk about this! You son of a bitch!}
{236}{}{Damn it.}
#military card...
{237}{}{[Sighs.] Listen, it may seem the situation is serious but I assure you, everything is under control. In fact, even
 as we speak, my men are conducting every necessary precaution. Furthermore, analyzing the collected data shows
 there is no immediate danger so we should be safe for the time being.}
{238}{}{How much time are we talking about?}
{239}{}{I've seen enough, I'm surprised you're still alive to say that.}
{240}{}{You're out of your mind! In fact, my data shows you should start running, right now!}
#first time...
{241}{}{And that's where you're wrong! Security doors don't just open themselves magically on voice command.
 Moreover, having you wander around carelessly can cause more damage than the issue itself. Let this be a reminder on
 safety procedures. Presently, I'm revoking your access to the plant's underground levels. There's the door!}
#238, 239
{242}{}{Decades or more will pass before any real threat emerges. But it's still too early to say, we haven't done
 all our tests, yet. More time is what we need, but I believe we're closer to more definitive answers with each passing
 day. In the meantime, it's the daily trouble what keeps us busy.}
{243}{}{If you say so.}
#dude tries to buy uranium
{244}{}{I told you. Not until Stockman's agreed to guard our shipments.}
{245}{}{Well, about that.}
