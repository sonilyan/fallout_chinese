#{100}{}{You see Birch.}
{100}{}{你看到桦树了。}
#{101}{}{Before you is a pretentious looking man with a straight, broom-like posture.}
{101}{}{在你面前的是一个自命不凡的人，一个笔直的，像扫帚一样的姿势。}
#{102}{}{}
{102}{}{}
#{110}{}{Wait, I already paid for this barn and do not want to pay extra for some questionable bonuses! You can tell this to Marilyn - and shall she bring some warm water to me already? I want to wash my feet.}
{110}{}{等等，我已经付了这个谷仓的钱，不想为一些可疑的奖金支付额外费用！你可以把这件事告诉玛丽莲――她能给我带些温水来吗？我想洗脚。}
#{111}{}{What are you talking about?}
{111}{}{你在说什么？}
#{112}{}{Oh, I thought you, like that snotty brat, came to promote her meat salads... The name's Lewis Birch and I arrived here recently... Although, nevermind.}
{112}{}{哦，我以为你，像那个小屁孩一样，来推销她的肉沙拉...我叫刘易斯・伯奇，最近刚到这里...不过，没关系。}
#{113}{}{Relax, I just want to ask some questions, as you're luckily not busy...}
{113}{}{别紧张，我只想问你几个问题，幸好你不忙...}
#{114}{}{I will. Goodbye.}
{114}{}{我会的。再见。}
#{115}{}{Questions? Apparently, the only thing you can do in this shithole is chat. Why not, though? If people ask an advice from me, that... That means something.}
{115}{}{问题？显然，你在这鬼地方唯一能做的就是聊天。为什么不呢？如果有人问我的建议...这意味着什么。}
#{116}{}{Hm?}
{116}{}{嗯？}
#{117}{}{Eh, you asked something?}
{117}{}{呃，你问了什么？}
#{118}{}{No, nothing. Let's talk later.}
{118}{}{不，没什么。我们晚点再说吧。}
#{119}{}{Let's change the subject.}
{119}{}{我们换个话题吧。}
#{120}{}{Let's stop at this, perhaps. We'll continue another time.}
{120}{}{也许我们就到此为止吧。我们下次再继续。}
#{121}{}{You asked something, sheriff?}
{121}{}{你问了什么，警长？}
#{130}{}{Why don't we talk about you?}
{130}{}{我们何不谈谈你呢？}
#{131}{}{About me? Oh, we can talk about it for hours.}
{131}{}{关于我？哦，我们可以谈几个小时。}
#{132}{}{Who're you?}
{132}{}{你是谁？}
#{133}{}{Lewis Birch. But my position will hardly tell you something. Let's just say - I'm, in some ways, a scientist, researcher and inventor.}
{133}{}{刘易斯・伯奇。但我的立场很难告诉你什么。我只是说，在某些方面，我是一个科学家，研究者和发明家。}
#{134}{}{You're not local? Then where did you came from?}
{134}{}{你不是本地人？那你是从哪里来的？}
#{135}{}{How perceptive... I'm from the south, from the city called The Hub. It's quite far from here, and I don't want to talk about that region. Though, I must say, the trip was horrible - no comfort, no logistics. Hardy's caravan was walking sideways, mostly in dry places, right under the sun. After such experience you start to appreciate a simple pleasures, like hot bath and a glass of cold brahmin milk... Yeah. So I don't recommend travel in that direction.}
{135}{}{多么敏锐...我来自南方，来自一个叫中心的城市。离这儿很远，我不想谈那个地区。不过，我必须说，这次旅行很可怕――没有舒适，没有后勤保障。哈代的大篷车在阳光下横着走着，大部分是在干燥的地方。在这样的经历之后，你开始欣赏一种简单的乐趣，比如洗个热水澡和一杯冷双头牛牛奶...是 啊。所以我不建议朝那个方向旅行。}
#{136}{}{Who's Hardy?}
{136}{}{谁是哈迪？}
#{137}{}{[Indifferently waves his hand] Some not-so-witty Hub caravaneer. He's the only one who trades between Reno and Hub. If I were him, I'd stop this long time ago, but what one ghoul has on his mind - it's a complicated question.}
{137}{}{[冷漠地挥挥手]一个不那么机智的大篷车司机。他是唯一一个在雷诺和哈伯之间交易的人。如果我是他，我早就停了，但一个食尸鬼脑子里想的是什么――这是个复杂的问题。}
#{138}{}{What brought you here?}
{138}{}{什么风把你吹来了？}
#{139}{}{Well, let's just say, my mission is simply gathering information about this... Godforsaken place. We've heard rumors of the still running local uranium ore mine. So, I was assigned to examine the situation. But what I see here is... Very depressing. The only option left for me is to return back, full of bewilderment and disappointment..}
{139}{}{好吧，我的任务就是收集信息...被遗弃的地方。我们听说当地的铀矿仍在开采。所以，我被派去调查情况。但我看到的是...很郁闷。我唯一的选择就是回来，充满困惑和失望。。}
#{140}{}{What kind of organization do you represent?}
{140}{}{你代表什么样的组织？}
#{141}{}{The Union of Atomic Workers? Oh, it's rather old company. We're not what we were in the past, I admit, but we still in the lead in Hub... Wait, you don't even know *that*? Ugh, unsurprising.}
{141}{}{原子能工人联盟？哦，这是一家相当老的公司。我们已经不是过去的样子了，我承认，但我们仍然在中心领先...等等，你都不知道？呃，不足为奇。}
#{142}{}{What does your organization do?}
{142}{}{你的组织是做什么的？}
#{143}{}{Well, let's say, without exaggeration and embellishment - basically, we are trying to revive the world. At least in the form which we once knew it - with the trade, economy, manufacturing, and all that is necessary for normal life of a society. But all of this is limited to Hub so far.}
{143}{}{好吧，让我们说，没有夸张和修饰-基本上，我们正在努力振兴世界。至少在形式上，我们曾经知道它-与贸易，经济，制造业，以及一切必要的正常生活的一个社会。但到目前为止，所有这些都仅限于Hub。}
#{150}{}{I want to know you opinion on this settlement.}
{150}{}{我想知道你对这次和解的看法。}
#{151}{}{Uranium City? Perhaps, some time ago it was "city", but now only "uranium" left. Unrefined even.}
{151}{}{铀城？也许，前段时间这里还是“城市”，但现在只剩下“铀”。甚至是粗制滥造的。}
#{152}{}{Do you know anything about history of this settlement?}
{152}{}{你知道这个定居点的历史吗？}
#{153}{}{Good question! After all, I'm here for exactly that - for information gathering. And here's what I know. Ahem. It's a pre-war settlement. Here the ore was mined, put through the simple refining, and then - exported to other places for further processing and usage.}
{153}{}{好问题！毕竟，我来这里就是为了收集信息。以下是我所知道的。啊哼。这是战前的和解。矿石在这里开采，经过简单的精炼，然后出口到其他地方进一步加工利用。}
#{154}{}{[Next]}
{154}{}{[下一步]}
#{155}{}{Actually, the ore deposits are rather small. So, it's no surprise that locals lived here in conditions worse than slaves - they didn't even have carts for ore transportation, not to mention benches. The only ore processor is in the hangar, near the mine - and it was terribly outdated even before the war. All of it lied meaningless since 2077, until some important person from New Reno decided to try extracting ore for the city power station. That's when the slaves began to be transported here and the flow of people poured in for easy earnings. Heh, silly people, I must say - most of them stayed here forever. Well, you know what I mean.}
{155}{}{实际上，矿床很小。因此，当地人生活在比奴隶更恶劣的条件下也就不足为奇了――他们甚至没有运输矿石的手推车，更不用说长凳了。唯一的矿石加工厂就在矿场附近的机库里，甚至在战争之前就已经过时了。自2077年以来，所有这些都毫无意义，直到一位来自新里诺的重要人物决定尝试为城市发电站开采矿石。就在那时，奴隶们开始被运送到这里，大批的人涌入这里，以获得轻松的收入。嘿，愚蠢的人，我必须说-他们中的大多数永远留在这里。你知道我的意思。}
#{156}{}{[Next]}
{156}{}{[下一步]}
#{157}{}{Now here's only silence remains. Why, you'd ask? And I know the answer. Because, according to local rumors, some kind of mutant creatures, appearing out of the ground, settled near the mine. My God, what a load of crap! I'll say how it is - local workers became tired of inhuman working conditions and fled to other towns. Someone should kick the Reno gangster's ass for his poor organizing work.}
{157}{}{现在只剩下沉默了。为什么，你会问？我知道答案。因为，根据当地的传闻，一些变种生物，从地下出现，定居在煤矿附近。天哪，真是一堆废话！我要说的是，当地工人厌倦了不人道的工作条件，逃到了其他城镇。有人应该揍那个里诺流氓一顿，因为他组织工作不力。}
#{158}{}{I'd like to know more about this settlement.}
{158}{}{我想了解更多关于这个定居点的情况。}
#{159}{}{Thanks for the story. That's enough.}
{159}{}{谢谢你的故事。够了。}
#{160}{}{What do you know about the mine?}
{160}{}{你对矿井了解多少？}
#{161}{}{There are several small mines in the district, many were milked out dry before the war. In fact, the ore deposits are not so big at all. That mine tunnel, near the village, leads straight to not depleted vein of rough uraninite. When it is fully worked out, there will be nothing left to do there. So this settlement will eventually die out. If not now, then ten years after, that's for sure.}
{161}{}{这个地区有好几处小矿场，许多是战前开采出来的。事实上，这些矿床一点也不大。在村庄附近的那条矿洞，直接通向未枯竭的粗铀矿矿脉。当它完全解决了，就没有什么可做的了。所以这个定居点最终会消失。如果不是现在，那么十年后，这是肯定的。}
#{162}{}{How did the locals managed to work here, if the ore from the mine is radioactive?}
{162}{}{如果矿上的矿石有放射性，当地人是怎么在这里工作的？}
#{163}{}{Hmm. I asked myself the same. I have a few suggestions. Want to listen?}
{163}{}{嗯。我也这么问自己。我有一些建议。想听吗？}
#{164}{}{Yes, please.}
{164}{}{好的，谢谢。}
#{165}{}{Nah, some other time. I have another question about this settlement.}
{165}{}{不，改天吧。我还有一个关于和解的问题。}
#{166}{}{First - is because of local guild's work regulations. Seems like people were smart enough to take into account the effects of radiation exposure. Anyway, the local equipment was not enough for everyone.}
{166}{}{首先是因为当地公会的工作规定。似乎人们足够聪明，考虑到辐射的影响。不管怎样，当地的设备对每个人来说都是不够的。}
#{167}{}{Second - cynical administration. Members of the guild themselves never even came close to the ore - they only supervised the process. But they exploited the staff ruthlessly. Who did overtime - was promised percentage bonuses. The more you work, the more you get paid per hour! Brilliant! How better to motivate employees in a situation like this? Of course, because of that, many ignored the regulations and worked in the mine for 14 hours a day. And when such stupid workaholic, greedy for money, dies from exposure, he is then burned in incinerator and his earned money split in the office. Brilliant!}
{167}{}{第二，玩世不恭的政府。公会成员自己甚至从来没有接近过矿石――他们只是监督这个过程。但他们无情地剥削了员工。加班的人――得到了一定比例的奖金。你工作得越多，每小时的工资就越多！太棒了！在这种情况下如何更好地激励员工？当然，正因为如此，很多人无视规定，每天在矿井里工作14个小时。而当这种愚蠢的工作狂，贪图钱财，死于暴晒，他就会被焚化炉烧死，挣来的钱在办公室里分得一杯羹。太棒了！}
#{168}{}{What else?}
{168}{}{还有什么？}
#{169}{}{But this does not explain why some worked here for a long time and didn't get radiation sickness.}
{169}{}{但这并不能解释为什么有些人在这里工作了很长时间，没有得辐射病。}
#{170}{}{[Frowns in displeasure] Yes... But there were quite a few of them. I can't consider Nelson - there's different, shady story behind him. I suspect that this is somehow related to the local ration. I haven't yet, uh, studied this question.}
{170}{}{是的...但他们中有不少人。我不能考虑纳尔逊-他背后有不同的，阴暗的故事。我怀疑这与当地的口粮有关。我还没研究这个问题。}
#{171}{}{Enough of this crap! Tell me straight then - you don't know shit about chemistry.}
{171}{}{受够这些废话了！那就直说吧-你根本不懂化学。}
#{172}{}{What!? H... How dare you! I'm the best scientist among the all Hub! But y-yeah, chemistry is not my strong suit. So what? If you're so educated, perhaps, you can share you thought on this matter, huh?}
{172}{}{什么！？H、 ...你怎么敢！我是世界上最好的科学家！但化学不是我的强项。那又怎么样？如果你受过这样的教育，也许你可以分享你对这件事的看法，嗯？}
#{173}{}{How curious. Could you find out what exactly? You seem to be a man of science... }
{173}{}{真奇怪。你能知道到底是什么吗？你好像是个有学问的人...}
#{174}{}{Uh, well, I'm one of the top scientists in the Hub... And one of the few, of course. But chemistry, especially organic - it's not my profile. However, I'd love to hear someone's hypothesis. But you yourself don't know, right?}
{174}{}{呃，好吧，我是中心最顶尖的科学家之一...当然，也是为数不多的。但是化学，尤其是有机化学-这不是我的个人资料。不过，我很想听听别人的假设。但你自己也不知道，对吧？}
#{175}{}{Does this town have a future?}
{175}{}{这个城镇有前途吗？}
#{176}{}{I'm sure it doesn't! When the local mine will be completely worked out, no one will care for the local ruins. However, before the war, it could still have a chance to be a some kind of open-air museum of mining, but now there's no one to attract.}
{176}{}{我肯定没有！当当地的煤矿全部开采完后，没有人会关心当地的废墟。然而，在战争之前，它仍然有机会成为某种露天采矿博物馆，但现在没有人吸引了。}
#{177}{}{About radiation sickness of the locals.}
{177}{}{关于当地人的辐射病。}
#{178}{}{Well, got any suggestions?}
{178}{}{有什么建议吗？}
#{179}{}{No, let's talk about something else.}
{179}{}{不，我们谈点别的吧。}
#{180}{}{I have one. Marilyn said miners consumed a lot of alcohol...}
{180}{}{我有一个。玛丽莲说矿工们喝了很多酒...}
#{181}{}{Ha! This is the same anti-scientific heresy as the belief that the brahmin were once one-headed! Nonsense. Alcohol is not a cure. We have already tested it at the Hub, local brew did show some effect, but very weak. To use a rot gut as a medicine against radiation sickness - don't make the scientist laugh!}
{181}{}{哈！这是同一种反科学的异端邪说，认为双头牛曾经是一头！胡说。酒精不是治疗方法。我们已经在中心进行了测试，本地brew确实显示了一些效果，但非常弱。用腐烂的肠子作为抗辐射病的药物――别逗科学家发笑！}
#{182}{}{Unlike other drinks, local "rot gut" traditionally contains a lot of ethanol.}
{182}{}{与其他饮料不同，当地的“腐肠”传统上含有大量乙醇。}
#{183}{}{Uhh, I don't understand how...}
{183}{}{呃，我不明白怎么...}
#{184}{}{Its radio-protective properties can improve the radiation resistance due to, for example, the reduction of oxygen in tissues, due to the easy oxidizability of alcohol compounds.}
{184}{}{它的防辐射性能可以提高抗辐射性，例如，由于醇化合物的易氧化性，组织中的氧减少。}
#{185}{}{Ehh, let me ret... }
{185}{}{呃，让我说...}
#{186}{}{However, alcohol does not really have a special anti-radiation effect. But inhibits the activity of nerve cells which means that any stressor, including radiation, is less harmful to the organism.}
{186}{}{然而，酒精并没有真正的抗辐射作用。但是抑制神经细胞的活动，这意味着包括辐射在内的任何应激源对机体的危害都较小。}
#{187}{}{Well... Ugh... Okay, if you really think about it, then there is some bits of common sense. However, I am sure that ethanol will be effective only with strong and brief irradiation, when the body receives a dose of radiation over a short period of time!.. On the other hand, if those workers were regulating their time in the mine... But... If... It is still unknown, what this booze contains, which can enhance the effect so much, you know!..}
{187}{}{好...呃...好吧，如果你真的想一想，那就有一些常识。然而，我确信只有在短时间内身体受到一定剂量的辐射时，乙醇才会有效！。。另一方面，如果那些工人在矿井里调整他们的时间...但是...如果...现在还不知道，这种酒含有什么成分，能增强这么多的效果，你知道的！。。}
#{188}{}{Uh-huh...}
{188}{}{啊哈...}
#{189}{}{[Straightens the hair and makes academic look] Well, the idea is certainly deserves attention. When I get back to the Hub, I'll try to conduct a series of experiments, it's worth to test this hypothesis.}
{189}{}{[拉直头发，让学术看起来]好吧，这个想法当然值得关注。当我回到中心，我将尝试进行一系列的实验，这是值得验证的假设。}
#{190}{}{See...}
{190}{}{看...}
#{191}{}{I must say, it was an enlightening conversation, but a bigger surprise for me is to meet a chemistry connoisseur in such a shithole. If you'll come to the Hub - be sure to visit us.}
{191}{}{我必须说，这是一次很有启发性的谈话，但对我来说更大的惊喜是在这样一个破洞里遇到一位化学鉴赏家。如果你要来中心-一定要来拜访我们。}
#{192}{}{I'll consider it.}
{192}{}{我会考虑的。}
#{193}{}{You have gained experience for using scientific knowledge.}
{193}{}{你获得了运用科学知识的经验。}
#{194}{}{I'll think about it, now let's chat about something else.}
{194}{}{我会考虑的，现在我们谈谈别的。}
#{200}{}{Have you thought about getting the mine under your lead?}
{200}{}{你有没有想过让地雷在你的领导下？}
#{201}{}{Manage the mine from the Hub?! Well... To say honestly, this would be perfect, if not for local problems. We don't want to deal with the former owner, local mutants and these rude workers.}
{201}{}{从中心管理矿？！好...老实说，这将是完美的，如果不是当地的问题。我们不想和前老板，当地的变种人和这些粗鲁的工人打交道。}
#{202}{}{You want to have everything nice and ready? Could you at least move your finger to not miss the opportunity for once?}
{202}{}{你想把一切都准备好吗？你能不能至少动一下手指，一次也不要错过这个机会？}
#{203}{}{In that case I have good news - mine is cleaned from the mutants.}
{203}{}{在这种情况下，我有一个好消息-我的是从变种清除。}
#{204}{}{I've said everything already.}
{204}{}{我已经说过了。}
#{205}{}{Oh, it makes all the difference! I would gladly buy the mine, but I need the approval of the members of our union. There is one hitch - I can't leave the settlement now, and the only communication is through the Hardy caravan which doesn't even have a regular schedule. Someone will have to send my report through the caravan.}
{205}{}{哦，这完全不同！我很乐意买下矿山，但我需要得到工会成员的同意。有一个问题-我现在不能离开定居点，唯一的沟通是通过艰苦的商队，甚至没有一个固定的时间表。总得有人把我的报告送到大篷车里。}
#{206}{}{Then I'll send the report.}
{206}{}{那我就把报告寄过去。}
#{207}{}{Really? That makes all the difference! If so, then I will send the information to the Hub at the first opportunity. I think the members of our union will approve this decision. Yes, and tell the news to Marilyn. Thank you.}
{207}{}{真正地？那就完全不同了！如果是这样的话，我会在第一时间将信息发送到中心。我想我们工会的成员会同意这个决定的。是的，把这个消息告诉玛丽莲。非常感谢。}
#{208}{}{You're welcome.}
{208}{}{不客气。}
#{209}{}{Not me, that's for sure. Bye.}
{209}{}{当然不是我。再见。}
#{210}{}{Well, you can be trusted. Here is a copy of the report. Find the Hardy's caravan. This ghoul travels between Reno and Hub. He has an agreement in Reno with a store at caravan parking lot, so he doesn't stay in the town for long.}
{210}{}{你是可以信任的。这是一份报告。找到哈代的商队。这个食尸鬼在雷诺和哈伯之间游荡。他在里诺和大篷车停车场的一家商店有协议，所以他不会在城里呆太久。}
#{211}{}{Okay.}
{211}{}{可以。}
#{212}{}{We already agreed on everything. Deliver the report, then our organization will take Uranium City under it's wing.}
{212}{}{我们什么都已经同意了。提交报告后，我们的组织将把铀城置于其旗下。}
#{213}{}{Report delivered.}
{213}{}{已提交报告。}
#{214}{}{That report? Got it.}
{214}{}{那份报告？知道了。}
#{250}{}{This pistol - it's energy weapon, right?}
{250}{}{这把手枪是能量武器，对吧？}
#{251}{}{[Grins joyfully] Noticeable thingie, isn't it? And even not so much noticeable as repelling for those who know what it is. Glock 86 Plasma pistol - serious business.}
{251}{}{很明显，不是吗？对那些知道它是什么的人来说，甚至没有那么明显的排斥。格洛克86等离子手枪-严肃的生意。}
#{252}{}{How interesting. Would you teach me to use one?}
{252}{}{真有趣。你能教我用一个吗？}
#{253}{}{Ah, perhaps I'll skip this little detail past my mind.}
{253}{}{啊，也许我会忽略这个小细节。}
#{254}{}{Hm. On the one hand, our Union is all for the principle of democracy and the information sharing. On the other, I have no desire to share such knowledge upon the Wasteland. Well, let's say - for your service, I can teach you the basics of such weapons, but nothing extra.}
{254}{}{嗯。一方面，我们的联盟完全支持民主和信息共享的原则。另一方面，我不想在荒地上分享这些知识。好吧，让我说-为了你的服务，我可以教你这种武器的基本知识，但没有额外的。}
#{255}{}{One good turn deserves another? That's fair.}
{255}{}{善有善报？这很公平。}
#{256}{}{No, such option doesn't satisfy me.}
{256}{}{不，这样的选择让我不满意。}
#{257}{}{Don't take me for barbarian, but I haven't had a bath yet, and this lady behind the bar, who runs this place, didn't give me the water. I don't ask much - 30 pounds at least, to fill the washbowl. Would you be so kind to provide me with water? And then we'll discuss what to do next.}
{257}{}{别以为我是野蛮人，但我还没洗过澡，酒吧后面的这位女士，经营这个地方，没有给我水。我不要求太多-至少30磅，来装满洗脸盆。你能给我水吗？然后我们再讨论下一步该怎么做。}
#{258}{}{I'll think about it.}
{258}{}{我会考虑的。}
#{259}{}{I have clean water.}
{259}{}{我有干净的水。}
#{260}{}{I've got you clean water.}
{260}{}{我给你拿了干净的水。}
#{261}{}{I hope, there'll be at least 30 POUNDS of water?}
{261}{}{我希望至少有30磅水？}
#{262}{}{Yes, 15 flasks, 2 pounds each.}
{262}{}{是的，15瓶，每瓶2磅。}
#{263}{}{No, I don't have such amount.}
{263}{}{不，我没有这么多钱。}
#{264}{}{That's better! And Marilyn didn't want to share... Now leave me for an hour. Perhaps, I'll ask you about another one later.}
{264}{}{这样更好！玛丽莲不想分享...现在离开我一个小时。也许，我以后再问你一个。}
#{265}{}{[Wait outside]}
{265}{}{[在外面等]}
#{266}{}{You're still dirty, under the ear...}
{266}{}{你还是很脏，耳朵底下...}
#{267}{}{Well-well. I don't like lavatory humor much. But still - thanks. Walking unwashed since the Hub itself - what a "pleasure".}
{267}{}{好吧，好吧。我不太喜欢厕所幽默。但还是-谢谢。从中心到现在还没洗衣服走路-真是一种“乐趣”。}
#{268}{}{How can you even spend so much scarce water on washing your body?! It's foolish!}
{268}{}{你怎么能把这么少的水花在洗身上？！太愚蠢了！}
#{269}{}{I don't care. I did my part of a deal and now I want the bonus.}
{269}{}{我不在乎。我做了我该做的，现在我想要奖金。}
#{270}{}{That's right - it was foolish to waste so much water on one person. Ha! Now who's more foolish, eh?}
{270}{}{是的，在一个人身上浪费这么多水是愚蠢的。哈！现在谁更傻，嗯？}
#{271}{}{Have to leave it on your conscience. Now I want to get my bonus.}
{271}{}{你得凭良心去做。现在我想拿到奖金。}
#{272}{}{Ah yes. I remember what I promised. But there's one more important thing.}
{272}{}{啊，是的。我记得我答应过的。但还有一件更重要的事。}
#{273}{}{Wha-at!? What the hell!}
{273}{}{什么意思！？我勒个去！}
#{274}{}{Alright. I'll do your thing.}
{274}{}{好吧。我来做你的事。}
#{275}{}{This is too important to trust to simple adventurer. The story with the water was a test of your motivation and interest. In fact, I gave part of the water to Marilyn for the needs of the motel. Our Union bequeathed to share knowledge and experience with people, if they deserve it. Now I'm sure that we have a common interest, no matter what drives you - greed or the desire to help people.}
{275}{}{这对简单的冒险家来说太重要了。关于水的故事是对你动机和兴趣的考验。事实上，我把一部分水给了玛丽莲，以满足汽车旅馆的需要。如果人们值得的话，我们的工会会留下来与他们分享知识和经验。现在我确信我们有一个共同的利益，不管是什么驱使你――贪婪还是帮助他人的欲望。}
#{276}{}{And what do you need?}
{276}{}{你需要什么？}
#{277}{}{I prepared a report for my comrades in the Hub, and I need an intermediary to transfer it there. I understand that the Hub is far away and you will not go there, but this is a concern of one of caravans.}
{277}{}{我给枢纽的同志们准备了一份报告，需要中间人转送到那里。据我所知，枢纽很遥远，你不会去那里，但这是一个大篷车关心的问题。}
#{278}{}{I'll do it.}
{278}{}{我会的。}
#{279}{}{I don't want to do this.}
{279}{}{我不想这么做。}
#{280}{}{I remember you wanted to give me a task?}
{280}{}{我记得你想给我一个任务？}
#{281}{}{Ah yes. I remember what I promised. But first you need to do some post delivery.}
{281}{}{啊，是的。我记得我答应过的。但首先你需要做一些送货后的工作。}
#{282}{}{Got it.}
{282}{}{知道了。}
#{283}{}{Ah yes. I remember what I promised. Since you have already sent the report, I can only lay down my gloves in honest and share my knowledge.}
{283}{}{啊，是的。我记得我答应过的。既然你已经把报告寄出去了，我只能诚实地把我的知识告诉你。}
#{284}{}{Then let's start now!}
{284}{}{那我们现在就开始吧！}
#{285}{}{I'll come back later when I'm ready.}
{285}{}{我准备好以后再来。}
#{286}{}{You know, I'm sick of it, so I refuse.}
{286}{}{你知道，我受够了，所以我拒绝了。}
#{287}{}{[Oddly enough, Birch was a good teacher, he systematically and consistently explained to you the principles of plasma weapons and some properties of using it.]}
