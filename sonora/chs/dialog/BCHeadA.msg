{205}{}{那我们应该更好地了解彼此。}
### {206}{}{So you suffered the same fate as many? I'm sorry. But you won't find your fellow tribesmen here.}
{206}{}{所以你和很多人一样遭遇了同样的命运？对不起。但你在这里找不到你的部落同胞。}
### {207}{}{Are you also worried about slavers?}
{207}{}{你也担心奴隶主吗？}
### {208}{}{Perhaps the peasants of the Villa are kept here. Don't even think about interfering with my search.}

### {217}{}{My go to Grandpa.}
{217}{}{我去找爷爷。}

### {220}{}{They call themselves missionaries. They came to our lands and impose their own rules on us. The tribe resists, but the price for our freedom is getting higher. We are on the verge of war with the white-skinned citizens of Phoenix.}
{220}{}{他们自称为传教士。他们来到我们的土地，把他们自己的规则强加给我们。部落反抗，但我们自由的代价越来越高。我们正处于与凤凰城白皮肤公民开战的边缘。}
### {221}{}{There's plenty of room in the wastelands. What didn't you share?}

### {222}{}{They want to bend us to their will for the sake of Brahmins and cheap workers. But we are not the kind of Brahmins who obey anyone with a whip.}
{222}{}{为了婆罗门和廉价工人，他们想让我们屈从于他们的意愿。但我们不是那种用鞭子服从任何人的婆罗门。}

{223}{}{你和我很像。维拉也珍视她的自由。但它被武力夺走了。}

### {252}{}{I have to go. See you later, Nana.}
{252}{}{我得走了。再见，娜娜。}

### {260}{}{I ask you to advocate for an alliance with the Phoenix missionaries.}
{260}{}{我请你倡导与凤凰城传教士结盟。}
### {261}{}{I didn't expect you to take their side. But I don't see any reason to cuddle with a snake. Phoenix will betray our tribe as soon as it turns out to be profitable.}
{261}{}{我没想到你会站在他们一边。但是我看不出有什么理由去拥抱蛇。一旦凤凰盈利，它就会背叛我们的部落。}
### {262}{}{I do not know what to answer. Maybe you're even right.}
{262}{}{我不知道该回答什么。也许你是对的。}
### {263}{}{Open your eyes - Phoenix is more profitable than rangers for the whole tribe.}

### {266}{}{Okay. Let's not argue.}

{267}{}{游骑兵是背信弃义的。他们把你用于战争目的。凤凰城提供了一个工会和许多问题的解决方案。}
### {268}{}{Hmm. I hadn't thought about it before. Okay, you can count on my vote during the council of elders.}
{268}{}{嗯，我以前没想过。好吧，你可以指望我在长老会议上的投票。}
### {269}{}{You won't regret your choice.}
{269}{}{你不会后悔你的选择。}
### {270}{}{Great, that's all I need.}
{270}{}{太好了，这就是我所需要的。}
### {271}{}{The union would solve many of your problems.}
{271}{}{工会会解决你的许多问题。}
### {272}{}{Perhaps it is. But if we become part of the empire, we will lose ourselves. More importantly, we will be defenseless against outsiders. What will we do if we are betrayed? How will we protect ourselves?}
{272}{}{也许是这样。但如果我们成为帝国的一部分，我们就会迷失自我。更重要的是，我们将无法抵御外来者。如果我们被背叛了，我们该怎么办？我们将如何保护自己？}
### {273}{}{You need strength. You need a weapon.}
{273}{}{你需要力量。你需要一把武器。}
### {274}{}{Right. The kind of weapon that Phoenix won't give us. If we had those fire rifles that kill a healthy man with one shot, we wouldn't be afraid of any alliances.}
{274}{}{正确的凤凰不会给我们的那种武器。如果我们有那种一枪打死一个健康人的步枪，我们就不会害怕任何联盟。}
### {275}{}{I'll bring you three hunting rifles. And in return, you will advocate for the union at the council of elders.}
{275}{}{我给你带三支猎枪。作为回报，你将在长老会上倡导工会。}
### {276}{}{So be it. Get us the alien weapons, and I'll take your side.}
{276}{}{那就这样吧。给我们外星人的武器，我会站在你这边。}
### {277}{}{Agreed.}
{277}{}{同意。}
### {278}{}{OK. I heard you.}
{278}{}{好的，我听到了。}
### {1278}{}{Good. I heard you.}

### {293}{}{And yet Geronimo made an alliance with the Rangers. I shouldn't have listened to you and opposed this union.}

{297}{}{啊，对不起。我忘了你们这些野蛮人是那么愚蠢。习惯于让领导为你决定一切，对吧？}
### {298}{}{I will ask the Divine Brahmin to send snakes under your feet during the journey.}
{298}{}{我会请神圣的婆罗门在旅途中把蛇放在你的脚下。}
### {299}{}{Aha. Later.}
{299}{}{啊哈。后来}
