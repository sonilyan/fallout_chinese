### {212}{}{More?}
{212}{}{更多}

### {220}{}{Padre, why have we always lived in isolation from the rest of the world?}
{220}{}{神父，为什么我们总是与世隔绝？}
### {221}{}{Excessive contacts with foreigners will not bring good. So the Founder bequeathed. And we learned that well during the raid. Remember the settlements you have visited. People are divided and cannot cohabit in peace and harmony like us.}
{221}{}{与外国人过度接触不会带来好处。于是创始人遗赠。我们在突袭中很好地学到了这一点。记住你去过的定居点。人们是分裂的，不能像我们一样在和平与和谐中共存。}

### {228}{}{I demand an explanation - why the hell is a stranger in a white coat wandering around our plaza and staring at our houses?}
{228}{}{我要求一个解释――为什么一个穿着白大褂的陌生人在我们的广场上徘徊，盯着我们的房子看？}
### {229}{}{Arthur Carrington is a scientist. It seemed to me that his help would be useful in restoring the Villa after the raid.}
{229}{}{阿瑟・卡林顿是一位科学家。在我看来，他的帮助将有助于在突袭后修复别墅。}
### {230}{}{The help of a person who can read and count, but can't hold a shovel in his hand?}
{230}{}{一个会读书和数数，但手里拿不住铲子的人的帮助？}
### {231}{}{He's a little weak, right, but he knows a lot more about the outside world than you and me. And he also understands old technologies. With their help, we...}
{231}{}{他有点软弱，对吧，但他比你我更了解外面的世界。他也了解旧技术。在他们的帮助下，我们。。。}
### {232}{}{I don't believe my ears! Has traveling through the desert completely overshadowed your mind? We've lived in isolation from the rest of the world for generations, and you bring an outsider here and offer to take up old technologies? Pray that your decision does not turn out to be a mistake. I will keep a close eye on this stranger. And for you, too.}
{232}{}{我不相信我的耳朵！穿越沙漠的旅行完全盖过了你的头脑吗？我们几代人都生活在与世界其他地方隔绝的环境中，而你却把一个局外人带到这里，并提出要采用旧技术？祷告你的决定不会变成错误。我会密切关注这个陌生人。对你来说也是如此。}
### {233}{}{You won't regret it.}
{233}{}{你不会后悔的。}
### {234}{}{You know, the community intends to punish Chris for cowardice.}
{234}{}{你知道，社区打算惩罚克里斯的懦弱。}
### {235}{}{Villa has always held on to the opinion of the majority. That's the law. It was only thanks to this that we survived in the middle of the desert. Chris's story will be a great example of how important it is to follow everyone.}
{235}{}{维拉一直坚持大多数人的意见。这就是法律。正是由于这一点，我们才得以在沙漠中生存下来。克里斯的故事将是一个很好的例子，说明跟随每个人是多么重要。}

### {238}{}{That's why we refused to contact outsiders - so that they would not stain our fragile world with their selfishness. By letting outsiders into the community, we will only get discord. So keep your mouth shut when you talk about such things with the rest of the residents of the Villa.}
{238}{}{这就是为什么我们拒绝与外界接触――这样他们就不会因为自私而玷污我们脆弱的世界。让外人进入社区，只会引起不和。所以，当你和别墅的其他居民谈论这些事情时，请闭嘴。}
### {239}{}{I see.}
{239}{}{我明白了。}

### {240}{}{I need supplies and reliable weapons for my mission.}
{240}{}{我的任务需要补给和可靠的武器。}
### {241}{}{(nods his head significantly) I agree. I think it's time to give you some of our relics. There is a safe in my office on the second floor. It stores valuable old things. Take what will be useful to you. The code from the safe is 2093. This is the year when the Founder came to these lands and cultivated the first corn cobs.}
{241}{}{（明显地点了点头）我同意。我想是时候给你一些我们的遗物了。我的办公室在二楼有一个保险箱。它储存有价值的旧物。拿走对你有用的东西。保险箱的代码是2093。这一年，创始人来到这些土地上，种植了第一批玉米棒。}

{251}{}{我们的朋友仍然被弗拉格斯塔夫殖民者俘虏。维拉现在太需要我了，我不能离开定居点去救他们。你必须这么做。}

{252}{}{好的，我来做。}
### {253}{}{Are you crazy?! It took so much work to free you from Two-Sun, and now Flagstaff...}
{253}{}{你疯了吗？！花了很多工作才把你从两个太阳中解放出来，现在弗拉格斯塔夫。。。}
### {254}{}{We have no choice! This is your responsibility as the future leader of the community. Do what YOU HAVE to do!}
{254}{}{我们别无选择！这是你作为社区未来领导者的责任。做你必须做的事！}
### {1254}{}{We have no choice! This is your responsibility as the future leader of the community. Do what YOU HAVE to do!}
{1254}{}{我们别无选择！这是你作为社区未来领导者的责任。做你必须做的事！}
### {255}{}{Your madre hasn't returned from Flagstaff. I'm afraid she's still in the clutches of the mercenaries. Save her at any cost!}
{255}{}{你的妻子还没有从弗拉格斯塔夫回来。恐怕她仍在雇佣军的控制之下。不惜一切代价救她！}
### {256}{}{You can count on me, Padre.}
{256}{}{你可以相信我，神父。}
### {257}{}{Madre is dead. Don't wait for her.}

### {259}{}{Okay.}
{259}{}{可以}
### {260}{}{(takes a deep breath, closing his eyes) Maria... Are you sure you know that? Well, it's better for the rest not to know yet, such news can further burden the lives of our people.}
{260}{}{（深吸一口气，闭上眼睛）玛丽亚。。。你确定你知道吗？好吧，其他人最好还不知道，这样的消息会给我们人民的生活带来进一步的负担。}
### {261}{}{What are we going to do now?}
{261}{}{我们现在该怎么办？}
### {262}{}{We have a lot of work ahead of us. The raiders looted the settlement, rats got into the cellars, the plantations fell into disrepair during our absence, but the main thing is that we must be ready for new clashes with an external threat.}
{262}{}{我们还有很多工作要做。袭击者洗劫了定居点，老鼠进入地窖，种植园在我们不在的时候年久失修，但最重要的是，我们必须为与外部威胁的新冲突做好准备。}

{263}{}{[下一个]}
### {264}{}{The whole community should solve this issue. We are gathering a council in the town hall, you come too. Your travel experience will be especially useful when making decisions. Don't be late.}

### {270}{}{The council wants to blow up the Flagstaff mines. How do you like this idea?}
{270}{}{委员会想炸毁弗拉格斯塔夫煤矿。你觉得这个主意怎么样？}
### {271}{}{It's very risky, but it needs to be done. And no one else but you can do it. If we leave the mines as they are, then slavery will only expand and someday it will reach us again. We have too little strength to confront this problem.}
{271}{}{这是非常危险的，但它需要做。除了你，没有其他人能做到。如果我们离开矿山，那么奴隶制只会扩大，总有一天它会再次降临到我们身上。我们面对这个问题的力量太小了。}

### {273}{}{The council decided to destroy the Garage City plant. What do you think about it?}
{273}{}{市政委员会决定摧毁车库城的工厂。你觉得怎么样？}
### {274}{}{Scavengers deserve this fate. They have already betrayed us by providing the raiders with everything they need for a raid. Now they decided to start the old factory. We will lose a lot if this happens. We will lose our privacy, peaceful life and our way of life, which has been developing for decades. To hell with this factory!}
{274}{}{拾荒者理应受到这样的命运。他们已经背叛了我们，为袭击者提供了袭击所需的一切。现在他们决定开办这家旧工厂。如果发生这种情况，我们将损失惨重。我们将失去我们的隐私、平静的生活和几十年来一直在发展的生活方式。这家工厂见鬼去吧！}
### {275}{}{Clear.}

{276}{}{你觉得和游骑兵队结盟怎么样？}
### {277}{}{The Rangers have their own goals, and they don't coincide with ours in everything. But we need allies to strengthen our forces. And there is no one better than rangers. We can only hope that they will not interfere in our internal affairs, limiting themselves only to protection in exchange for food.}
{277}{}{流浪者队有自己的目标，但他们并不是在所有方面都与我们的目标一致。但我们需要盟友来加强我们的力量。没有人比护林员更好了。我们只能希望他们不会干涉我们的内政，只把自己局限于以保护换取食物。}

{278}{}{也许你是对的，神父。}

### {281}{}{Good answer, Padre.}

#Background of the Villa
### {300}{}{I know about the Founder's Precepts.}
{300}{}{我知道创始人的戒律。}
### {301}{}{Well, I thought it was too early for you to know about such things. The rest of the residents should not read them either - there is no need to load their heads with questions that are worthy only of leaders. And you, as the future leader of the community, should treat these Covenants with all due attention and respect.}
{301}{}{我觉得你现在知道这些事情还为时过早。其他居民也不应该读这些书――没有必要在他们的脑海里塞满只有领导人才能提出的问题。作为社区未来的领导者，你应该对这些公约给予应有的关注和尊重。}
### {302}{}{Do you completely agree with this text?}
{302}{}{你完全同意这段文字吗？}
### {303}{}{Of course. We have followed the Precepts all these generations and must follow them in the future. The founder was a wise man, and his wisdom came from a difficult life experience. Such an experience that none of us have. If he tells us to abandon the old technology, then it makes sense. If he says to cultivate maize, then we will be strong in this. If he considers the interference of the rest of the world in our affairs unacceptable, then the story of the raid only confirms this.}
{303}{}{当然我们这几代人都遵守了戒律，将来也必须遵守。这位创始人是一位智者，他的智慧来自于艰难的人生经历。这样的经历我们谁也没有。如果他告诉我们放弃旧技术，那么这是有道理的。如果他说要种植玉米，那么我们在这方面就会很强大。如果他认为世界其他国家干涉我们的事务是不可接受的，那么这次突袭的故事只会证实这一点。}
### {304}{}{I see.}
{304}{}{我明白了。}
### {305}{}{I happened to visit Vault 27. You never talked about him.}
{305}{}{我碰巧参观了27号金库。你从来没有谈论过他。}
### {306}{}{What are you saying?! The very Vault from which our ancestors came out?}
{306}{}{你在说什么？！正是我们祖先的避难所？}
### {307}{}{Exactly. As the Founder said, this is a real storehouse of old technologies...}
{307}{}{确切地正如创始人所说，这是一个真正的旧技术仓库。。。}
### {308}{}{Shut up! The Founder left the Vault. And you already know why. It is not necessary to stir up the past. Forget everything you could see and hear there.}
{308}{}{闭嘴！创始人离开了金库。你已经知道为什么了。没有必要挑拨离间。忘记你在那里看到和听到的一切。}
### {1308}{}{Shut up! The Founder left the Vault. And you already know why. It is not necessary to stir up the past. Forget everything you could see and hear there.}
{1308}{}{闭嘴！创始人离开了金库。你已经知道为什么了。没有必要挑拨离间。忘记你在那里看到和听到的一切。}
### {309}{}{Why are you so afraid of the past?}
{309}{}{你为什么如此害怕过去？}

### {310}{}{The founder believed that the community should abandon technology and engage only in manual labor. Therefore, he tried not to talk about the Vault and its technologies.}
{310}{}{创始人认为，社区应该放弃技术，只从事体力劳动。因此，他尽量不谈论Vault及其技术。}
### {311}{}{But it's not just that? He stole some kind of Generator of the Garden of Eden and thereby condemned everyone else to suffering.}
{311}{}{但不仅仅是这样？他偷走了某种伊甸园的发电机，从而使其他人遭受痛苦。}
### {312}{}{(in the heat) It doesn't matter! He was saving his people! (calming down) Hard times required hard decisions. The founder lived with this burden until the end of his days. But it was he who created the Villa and gave life to this desert. And if someone considers his act a crime, I am personally ready to rip out his tongue.}
{312}{}{（在高温下）没关系！他在拯救他的人民！（冷静下来）困难时期需要艰难的决定。这位创始人一直承受着这种负担，直到生命的尽头。但正是他创造了这座别墅，并赋予了这片沙漠生命。如果有人认为他的行为是犯罪，我个人准备撕掉他的舌头。}
### {313}{}{But Padre...}
{313}{}{但是神父。。。}
### {314}{}{I understand. You won't hear about it again.}
{314}{}{我理解。你不会再听到这件事了。}

### {315}{}{That's enough! Don't discuss it with anyone. The peasants will not be able to understand, and I and the elders categorically do not want to know anything.}
{315}{}{够了！不要和任何人讨论。农民听不懂，我和长老也绝对不想知道。}
### {316}{}{Whatever you say, Padre.}
{316}{}{不管你说什么，神父。}
### {317}{}{Well, I'll think about your words.}
{317}{}{好吧，我会好好想想你的话。}
### {318}{}{Thank you. Don't discuss it with anyone. The peasants will not be able to understand, and I and the elders categorically do not want to know anything.}
{318}{}{非常感谢。不要和任何人讨论。农民听不懂，我和长老也绝对不想知道。}
