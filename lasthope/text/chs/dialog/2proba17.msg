### {100}{}{Leave me alone, alright. If you're here to ask more questions, you can forget about it. I already told the sheriff everything I know.}
{100}{}{别管我，好吗。如果你来问更多的问题，你可以忘记它。我已经告诉了警长我所知道的一切。}
### {101}{}{I thought, if you weren't too busy spending your time in a locked cell, maybe we could talk for a minute?}

{102}{}{当然，你可以回到你正在做的任何事情。我不在乎。}
### {103}{}{[Sits down on the bed.] I don't like the sound of it but you got a point. [Sighs.] You know, some bastard must've set me up. Problem is, I was so drunk that night I don't remember anyone putting some shit in my pocket. All I know is that I had an argument with some drunkard at the bar... Next thing I know, I was lying on the floor covered in glass and blood. Son of a bitch hit me on the head with a bottle...}
{103}{}{[坐在床上。]我不喜欢它的声音，但你说得有道理。你知道，一定是哪个混蛋陷害了我。问题是，那天晚上我喝得酩酊大醉，我不记得有人在我口袋里放大便了。我只知道我在酒吧里和一个醉汉发生了争执。。。接下来我知道的是，我躺在地板上，浑身是玻璃和血。婊子养的用瓶子打我的头。。。}

### {106}{}{Sure, maybe little numb but I can handle it. So, let's get back to that get out part. Why are you risking your ass for me anyway? I can't really pay you, I'm left with only a couple of bottle caps in my pockets. [Smiles.] That sure isn't going to cover my release.}
{106}{}{当然，也许有点麻木，但我能应付。所以，让我们回到下车的部分。你为什么要为我冒这个险？我真的付不起钱，我口袋里只剩下几个瓶盖了。[微笑]这肯定不能掩盖我的获释。}
### {107}{}{A couple of bottle caps!? I'm out of here.}
{107}{}{几个瓶盖！？我要离开这里。}
### {108}{}{Actually, your boss sent me to get you out. That's all I'm here for.}

{119}{}{习惯它。这是你的归属。}
### {120}{}{...as if that wasn't enough, the sheriff started asking me some questions. Shit, all I could hear was mumbling. You should have seen his face when he found a bag of contraband in my back pocket... he was waiting for something like that to happen. You know the rest of the story...}
{120}{}{…似乎这还不够，警长开始问我一些问题。妈的，我只能听到喃喃自语。当他在我的后口袋里发现一袋违禁品时，你应该看到他的脸。。。他在等类似的事情发生。你知道故事的其余部分。。。}
### {121}{}{There's also a part when you get out, I'm writing it right now... So, can you walk?}
{121}{}{还有一部分当你离开的时候，我现在正在写。。。那么，你会走路吗？}
