### {100}{}{You see Carlos.}
{100}{}{你看到卡洛斯了。}
### {101}{}{Here is one of the peasants of the Villa. However, he became somehow... other.}
{101}{}{这是别墅里的一个农民。然而，不知怎么的，他变得。。。另外}
### {102}{}{They say real science is coming back to Casa Nueva. Like before the Great War. I have to be there.}
{102}{}{他们说真正的科学正在回到努瓦之家。就像大战前一样。我必须在那里。}
### {103}{}{I'll be back home... to make it more civilized.}
{103}{}{我会回家的。。。让它更文明。}
### {104}{}{I have no choice but to go on a journey. I hope to see a lot of new things.}
{104}{}{我别无选择，只能去旅行。我希望看到很多新事物。}
### {105}{}{How... how can you...}
{105}{}{怎样你怎么能。。。}
### {106}{}{You... it's your fault...}
{106}{}{你是你的错。。。}

#The first dialog
### {200}{}{? You... why are you here?}
{200}{}{？你你为什么在这里？}
### {201}{}{Obviously to save your ass, Carlos. Let's get out of here...}
{201}{}{显然是为了救你，卡洛斯。让我们离开这里。。。}
### {202}{}{Salvation... Salvation from what? From the mouse fuss in the beds with dying crops? From diseases for which the peasants will never find a cure? From enemies against whom we didn't even have primitive rifles? I don't see salvation. I see only the narrow and limited horizons of a handful of diggers.}
{202}{}{拯救什么拯救？从老鼠在有垂死庄稼的床上大惊小怪？农民永远找不到治愈的病？来自那些我们甚至没有原始步枪的敌人？我看不到救赎。我只看到少数挖掘者狭窄而有限的视野。}
### {203}{}{Who are you talking about?}
{203}{}{你在说谁？}
### {204}{}{We are savages, amigo, understand this. Savages who saw electric light for the first time only after being in slavery. It was like living in a tin can until someone opened it and showed us the vast world around. And the Villa turned out to be only a small part of it, and not the center, as previously thought.}
{204}{}{我们是野蛮人，朋友，明白这一点。野蛮人，在成为奴隶后才第一次看到电灯。这就像生活在一个锡罐里，直到有人打开它，向我们展示了周围广阔的世界。事实证明，维拉只是其中的一小部分，而不是之前认为的中心。}
### {205}{}{Wait a minute...}
{205}{}{等一下。。。}
### {206}{}{Only here I was able to realize myself and my talents. Because my passion for technology was banned in my homeland. I hid it so as not to cause problems for myself and others. Now I am free to follow the call of my mind, and not drag myself after the pack. Go away, amigo. Leave me here.}
{206}{}{只有在这里，我才能认识到自己和我的才能。因为我对科技的热情在我的祖国被禁止了。我把它藏起来，以免给自己和他人带来麻烦。现在我可以自由地听从我的想法，而不是拖泥带水。走开，朋友。把我留在这里。}
### {207}{}{I'll leave you for now. But don't think you'll get rid of me so easily.}
{207}{}{我暂时离开你。但别以为你会这么容易就把我赶走。}
### {208}{}{I don't think I'm going to dissuade you. Goodbye, amigo.}
{208}{}{我想我不会劝阻你的。再见，朋友。}

### {210}{}{Villa time is over, understand this.}
{210}{}{别墅时代结束了，明白这一点。}
### {211}{}{Okay, okay, finish it already.}
{211}{}{好吧，好吧，已经做完了。}

### {230}{}{Can you explain what's going on here?}
{230}{}{你能解释一下这里发生了什么吗？}
### {231}{}{Tinsmiths are trying to open the burial of ancient equipment in the Forbidden Zone. They need local technologies and resources to expand and promote the idea of Progress. But the territory is well protected. Periodically, detachments of slaves and mercenaries are sent there, usually none of them returns.}
{231}{}{铁匠们正试图打开紫禁城内古代设备的埋葬处。他们需要当地的技术和资源来扩大和推广进步的理念。但这块领土受到了很好的保护。奴隶和雇佣兵分遣队定期被派往那里，通常没有一个返回。}
### {232}{}{Tell me about the tinsmiths.}
{232}{}{告诉我关于锡匠的事。}
### {233}{}{This is a semi-religious clan with an old history. They want to revive the ancient technologies they worship in order to put them in the service of people.}
{233}{}{这是一个有着悠久历史的半宗教氏族。他们想复兴他们崇拜的古老技术，以便为人民服务。}
### {234}{}{Tell me about the Restricted Area.}
{234}{}{告诉我有关禁区的情况。}
### {235}{}{This is a burial ground - the burial of ancient equipment, mainly for military purposes. Therefore, the territory is well fortified and guarded by robots. The tinkerers have found a way to disable the power barrier at the main gate for a short time, but this is not enough. If you're going to go inside, you'll need a special weapon against robots and a package of anti-radiation drugs.}
{235}{}{这是一个墓地――埋葬古代装备，主要用于军事目的。因此，这片领土被机器人严密防守。修补工们已经找到了一种方法，可以在短时间内禁用正门的电源屏障，但这还不够。如果你要进去，你需要一件对付机器人的特殊武器和一包抗辐射药物。}
### {236}{}{Who else was here from the Villa besides you?}
{236}{}{别墅里除了你还有谁？}
### {237}{}{Your padre and Gerardo. They have already been sent to the Restricted Area. If you want to save them, you'll have to go after them.}
{237}{}{你的牧师和杰拉尔多。他们已经被送到了禁区。如果你想救他们，你就得去追他们。}
### {238}{}{I'm going to go to the Restricted Area. Carlos, I really need help.}
{238}{}{我要去禁区。卡洛斯，我真的需要帮助。}
### {239}{}{I... can't help you... The tinsmiths keep a close eye on me and keep a clear record of their warehouses.}
{239}{}{我…帮不了你。。。锡匠们密切关注着我，并对他们的仓库做了清晰的记录。}
### {240}{}{Thanks for the answers. Now it's time for me to get busy.}
{240}{}{谢谢你的回答。现在是我忙碌的时候了。}
### {241}{}{Come on, the tinkerers should be interested in my success!}
{241}{}{来吧，修补匠们应该对我的成功感兴趣！}
### {242}{}{(looks around) I can give you something. These are pulse grenades. They say you can kill a robot with such a weapon at a time. Use them as a last resort.}
{242}{}{（环顾四周）我可以给你一些东西。这些是脉冲手榴弹。他们说你可以一次用这样的武器杀死一个机器人。把它们作为最后的手段。}
### {243}{}{Thank you, Carlos. You helped me a lot.}
{243}{}{谢谢你，卡洛斯。你帮了我很多。}
### {244}{}{Back to other questions.}
{244}{}{回到其他问题。}
### {245}{}{It's too dangerous. I'm sorry.}
{245}{}{太危险了。对不起。}

#Power Cell
### {250}{}{I need a power cell for the generator. Can you get it?}
{250}{}{我需要一个发电机的电池。你能拿到吗？}
### {251}{}{Don't ask me for anything! The tinkerers won't like it if I distribute technology without their permission.}
{251}{}{什么都不要问我！如果我在未经他们许可的情况下分发技术，修补匠们不会喜欢的。}
### {252}{}{It is very important. Help me!}
{252}{}{这非常重要。帮帮我！}
### {253}{}{No and no again! I'm not going to risk my place for the benefit of a handful of diggers.}
{253}{}{不，再也不！我不会为了少数挖掘者的利益而拿我的位置冒险。}
### {254}{}{You're saying hurtful words. See you later.}
{254}{}{你在说伤人的话。回头见。}
### {255}{}{Come to think of it, I know how to stay out of suspicion...}
{255}{}{仔细想想，我知道如何远离怀疑。。。}
### {256}{}{That's a good girl.}
{256}{}{那是个好女孩。}
### {257}{}{(looks around) If they ask, I have nothing to do with it.}
{257}{}{（环顾四周）如果他们问，我与此事无关。}
### {258}{}{Come on, amigo.}
{258}{}{来吧，朋友。}
### {259}{}{We'll see about that...}
{259}{}{我们拭目以待。。。}

#Care
### {300}{}{So are you going back to the Villa?}
{300}{}{你要回别墅吗？}
### {301}{}{Don't even ask. Until they kick me out of here, I won't leave myself.}
{301}{}{甚至不要问。除非他们把我踢出去，否则我不会离开自己。}
### {302}{}{I won't do it anymore. Have a good stay.}
{302}{}{我不会再做了。祝你住得愉快。}
### {303}{}{You're just a fool. And you will remain a fool.}
{303}{}{你只是个傻瓜。而你仍然是个傻瓜。}
### {304}{}{Too late. The tinkerers have been defeated, the territory is under the control of a hostile machine. Staying here, you'll just die.}
{304}{}{太迟了。修修补补的人被打败了，领土被敌对机器控制着。留在这里，你会死的。}
### {305}{}{After the death of Master Hard, the locals became even more intolerant of outsiders. Don't you notice that?}
{305}{}{哈德大师去世后，当地人对外来者更加难以容忍。你没注意到吗？}
### {306}{}{Have you already heard the news about your "thefts"?}
{306}{}{你听说过关于你“盗窃”的消息吗？}
### {307}{}{So this is your doing? Ooh... It looks like you have a serious attitude.}
{307}{}{这是你干的吗？哦。。。看起来你的态度很严肃。}
### {308}{}{You can't hide anywhere. My padre has ordered you to be returned alive or dead.}
{308}{}{你不能躲在任何地方。我的牧师已经命令你要么活着要么死了。}
### {309}{}{I'm sorry, but this is the only way to bring you to reason.}
{309}{}{很抱歉，但这是让你明白道理的唯一方法。}
### {310}{}{This is not your world. My padre says the same.}
{310}{}{这不是你的世界。我的牧师也这么说。}
### {311}{}{This is not your world, amigo. Here you are only a worker, but not a member of society.}
{311}{}{这不是你的世界，朋友。在这里，你只是一个工人，但不是社会的一员。}
### {312}{}{So far it is. But I'm growing above myself. And someday I will be able to join the ranks of tinsmiths on equal terms.}
{312}{}{到目前为止。但我正在超越自我。总有一天，我将能够平等地加入锡匠的行列。}
### {313}{}{We'll see about that...}
{313}{}{我们拭目以待。。。}
### {314}{}{Right. Tinkerers are distrustful of the rest of the inhabitants of the Wastelands. Their trust can only be achieved by fanaticism about technology. It will be very difficult to join their ranks as equals.}
{314}{}{正确的修补匠们不信任荒原上的其他居民。他们的信任只能通过对技术的狂热来实现。要平等地加入他们的行列将是非常困难的。}
### {315}{}{Then go back to the Villa and bring your knowledge there - that's your way.}
{315}{}{然后回到别墅，把你的知识带到那里――这就是你的方式。}
### {316}{}{Finally I hear the voice of reason in all this nonsense.}
{316}{}{终于，我在这些胡言乱语中听到了理性的声音。}
### {317}{}{}
{317}{}{error : string is empty}
### {318}{}{Damn it... I've already made my decision, and you have no idea how hard it was. But it looks like I have no choice left.}
{318}{}{该死…我已经做出了决定，你根本不知道这有多难。但看起来我别无选择。}
### {319}{}{So what have you decided?}
{319}{}{那么你决定了什么？}

### {320}{}{I can't go back to the Villa after everything that happened. I will not be accepted there, and my knowledge and skills will remain useless. You know how stubborn our relatives are.}
{320}{}{在发生了这一切之后，我不能再回别墅了。我不会在那里被接受，我的知识和技能也将毫无用处。你知道我们的亲戚有多固执。}
### {321}{}{But are there places where your talents will be in demand?}
{321}{}{但有没有地方会对你的才能有需求？}
### {322}{}{Hmm. Phoenix? No, it's a crappy place where the caps decide too much. That leaves Casa Nueva. Caravaneers told about this small settlement. They say there's a whole scientific laboratory where the best brains of Arizona flock.}
{322}{}{嗯，菲尼克斯？不，这是一个糟糕的地方，帽子决定得太多了。那就剩下努瓦之家了。房车客讲述了这个小定居点的情况。他们说有一个完整的科学实验室，亚利桑那州最优秀的人才聚集在那里。}
### {323}{}{So what prevents you from going there?}
{323}{}{是什么阻止你去那里？}
### {324}{}{This is a kind of closed settlement. Maybe I just won't be accepted. While I'm here trying to make a new life, can you go to the scientists and talk about my vacancy?}
{324}{}{这是一种封闭式定居点。也许我就是不被接受。当我在这里尝试新生活时，你能去找科学家谈谈我的空缺吗？}
### {325}{}{Of course, amigo. I'll do it out of old friendship.}
{325}{}{当然，朋友。我做这件事是出于老友谊。}
### {326}{}{Thank you, }
{326}{}{非常感谢。}
### {327}{}{. I'm waiting for news.}
{327}{}{。我在等消息。}
### {328}{}{See you later.}
{328}{}{回头见。}
### {329}{}{No, I have to go home. Solve your problem yourself.}
{329}{}{不，我得回家了。自己解决你的问题。}
### {330}{}{Sorry. But if you happen to be around, tell one of the scientists about me, okay?}
{330}{}{很抱歉但如果你碰巧在附近，告诉其中一位科学家我的情况，好吗？}
### {331}{}{I can't promise anything.}
{331}{}{我什么都不能答应。}
### {332}{}{Of course, absolutely.}
{332}{}{当然，绝对。}

### {340}{}{We've already discussed this. I can't go home.}
{340}{}{我们已经讨论过了。我不能回家。}
### {341}{}{As you wish. Bye.}
{341}{}{如你所愿。再见}
### {342}{}{Fools don't change. Goodbye.}
{342}{}{傻瓜不会改变。再见}
### {343}{}{I have good news. The followers of the Apocalypse have agreed to accept you with all your knowledge and skills.}
{343}{}{我有个好消息。启示录的追随者已经同意接受你所有的知识和技能。}
### {344}{}{This is encouraging. Don't worry about me, I'll find my way. Thank you for everything.}
{344}{}{这是令人鼓舞的。别担心我，我会找到路的。谢谢你所做的一切。}
### {345}{}{The main thing is that you don't work for these damn tinkerers. Come on, get out.}
{345}{}{最重要的是，你不为这些该死的修补工工作。来吧，滚出去。}
### {346}{}{Maybe someday I'll leave the village for good, like you. Goodbye.}
{346}{}{也许有一天我会像你一样永远离开这个村庄。再见}
### {347}{}{I'm sorry, but the Followers of the Apocalypse are in the deepest crisis. You won't be able to join them.}
{347}{}{对不起，启示录的追随者们正处于最严重的危机之中。你将无法加入他们。}
### {348}{}{Is it that bad? I've already heard rumors from the caravaneers. Well, it looks like there's no choice anymore. I'll have to go on a trip. I don't know where exactly yet. Maybe east to California. Or to the south, to the New Mexican State. But you definitely won't have to sit still.}
{348}{}{有那么糟糕吗？我已经听到了车队的传言。看来别无选择了。我得去旅行了。我还不知道具体在哪里。也许往东去加利福尼亚。或者往南，到新墨西哥州。但你绝对不必坐着不动。}
### {349}{}{And what, not a bad idea.}
{349}{}{什么，这主意不错。}
### {350}{}{Goodbye, }
{350}{}{再见}
### {351}{}{. Thanks for everything.}
{351}{}{。谢谢你所做的一切。}
