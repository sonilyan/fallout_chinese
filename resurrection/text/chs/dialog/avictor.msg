#{100}{}{You see a Hunter.}
{100}{}{你看到一个猎人。}
#{150}{}{You see Victor.}
{150}{}{你看到维克多了。}
#{200}{}{You see a Mutant Hunter.}
{200}{}{你看到一个变种猎人。}
#{250}{}{You see Victor. One could say he is a technician.}
{250}{}{你看到维克多了。可以说他是个技术员。}
#{400}{}{I bet the guards are asleep again.}
{400}{}{我打赌卫兵又睡着了。}
#{401}{}{Damn, I hate this sort of thing.}
{401}{}{该死，我讨厌这种事。}
#{402}{}{We really have to improve security.}
{402}{}{我们真的要加强安全。}
#{403}{}{They just let any idiot waltz in these days.}
{403}{}{这些天他们让任何一个白痴跳华尔兹。}
#{404}{}{Leave me be!}
{404}{}{别管我！}
#{500}{}{You're a newbie, aren't you? Hello.}
{500}{}{你是个新手，不是吗？你好。}
#{501}{}{Who are you?}
{501}{}{你是谁？}
#{502}{}{Uba, ghe?}
{502}{}{乌巴，酥油？}
#{550}{}{I'm Victor. I take care of what needs to be taken care of. One could say I am a technician.}
{550}{}{我是维克多。我照顾需要照顾的人。可以说我是个技术员。}
#{551}{}{What are you working on right now?}
{551}{}{你现在在做什么？}
#{552}{}{Can you modify weapons, too?}
{552}{}{你也能改装武器吗？}
#{553}{}{Can I ask you some questions?}
{553}{}{我能问你几个问题吗？}
#{554}{}{Take care, Victor.}
{554}{}{保重，维克多。}
#{600}{}{Oh, this generator right here. A group of our guys on patrol ran into it in some deserted building. They said it was the only useful-looking thing that was still left in there. I guess that was because you can't really stash it in a backpack. And of course because it's broken. It's missing an important part I sadly don't have. They must think I have magic powers or something.}
{600}{}{哦，这个发电机就在这里。我们巡逻的一群人在一栋废弃的大楼里撞到了它。他们说这是唯一有用的东西，仍然留在那里。我想那是因为你不能把它藏在背包里。当然是因为它坏了。它缺少了一个我很遗憾没有的重要部分。他们一定认为我有魔力什么的。}
#{601}{}{What are you going to do?}
{601}{}{你打算怎么办？}
#{602}{}{What do you need the generator for?}
{602}{}{你需要发电机做什么？}
#{603}{}{Can I have a look? Perhaps I can fix it.}
{603}{}{我能看看吗？也许我能修好它。}
#{604}{}{I won't be holding you up any longer.}
{604}{}{我不会再耽误你了。}
#{650}{}{To tell the truth, I have no idea. I have to think of something.}
{650}{}{说实话，我不知道。我得想想办法。}
#{651}{}{What do you need the generator for?}
{651}{}{你需要发电机做什么？}
#{652}{}{Can I have a look? Perhaps I can fix it.}
{652}{}{我能看看吗？也许我能修好它。}
#{653}{}{I won't be holding you up any longer.}
{653}{}{我不会再耽误你了。}
#{700}{}{To provide power to the two automatic turrets I installed in front of the elevator shaft. Once they're operational, we won't have to have a patrol over there and our defense against those beasts will be more effective. Sometimes, I can hear the guards snoring.}
{700}{}{为我安装在电梯井前的两个自动转台供电。一旦他们开始行动，我们就不用在那里巡逻了，我们对那些野兽的防御也会更有效。有时，我能听到警卫打鼾。}
#{701}{}{Why don't you hook them up to the reactor of the Vault?}
{701}{}{你为什么不把它们连接到保险库的反应堆上？}
#{702}{}{What are you going to do?}
{702}{}{你打算怎么办？}
#{703}{}{Can I have a look? Perhaps I can fix it.}
{703}{}{我能看看吗？也许我能修好它。}
#{704}{}{I won't be holding you up any longer.}
{704}{}{我不会再耽误你了。}
#{750}{}{Because I want them to be operational even after the reactor is turned off. In the interest of survival. Those beasts on the second prefer darkness. It's not that they don't like the light. But as soon as the lights go out, I bet you anything that they start rolling in here and those two turrets will be the only thing to at least slow them down. Damn, just the thought of Tulsa wanting to turn the reactor off gives me the creeps.}
{750}{}{因为我希望他们在反应堆关闭后也能正常工作。为了生存。第二排的那些野兽喜欢黑暗。并不是说他们不喜欢灯光。但一旦灯光熄灭，我敢打赌他们开始在这里滚动，这两个炮塔将是唯一的事情，至少减慢他们。妈的，一想到塔尔萨想关掉反应堆就让我毛骨悚然。}
#{751}{}{Why would he want to do that?}
{751}{}{他为什么要这么做？}
#{752}{}{What will you do with the generator?}
{752}{}{你要怎么处理发电机？}
#{753}{}{Can I have a look at the generator? Perhaps I can fix it.}
{753}{}{我能看看发电机吗？也许我能修好它。}
#{754}{}{I won't be holding you up any longer.}
{754}{}{我不会再耽误你了。}
#{800}{}{For now, these are thankfully just plans for the future, in case we wanted to make life up there a bit more difficult or to attack them directly. They draw almost all of their energy from the reactor.}
{800}{}{现在，谢天谢地，这些只是对未来的计划，以防我们想让那里的生活变得更困难或直接攻击他们。它们几乎从反应堆中吸取全部能量。}
#{801}{}{Is it not possible to switch off just a certain floor?}
{801}{}{不能只关闭某一楼层吗？}
#{802}{}{What will you do with the generator?}
{802}{}{你要怎么处理发电机？}
#{803}{}{Can I have a look at the generator? Perhaps I can fix it.}
{803}{}{我能看看发电机吗？也许我能修好它。}
#{804}{}{I won't be holding you up any longer.}
{804}{}{我不会再耽误你了。}
#{850}{}{Normally, the control room makes it possible to adjust the energy supply not just for individual floors, but also for individual rooms. However, the empire cut the connections with the first floor, save for the mains and we can't reach those.}
{850}{}{通常情况下，控制室不仅可以调整各个楼层的能源供应，还可以调整各个房间的能源供应。然而，帝国切断了与一楼的连接，除了干线，我们无法到达。}
#{851}{}{What will you do with the generator?}
{851}{}{你要怎么处理发电机？}
#{852}{}{Can I have a look at the generator? Perhaps I can fix it.}
{852}{}{我能看看发电机吗？也许我能修好它。}
#{853}{}{I won't be holding you up any longer.}
{853}{}{我不会再耽误你了。}
#{900}{}{Yeah, but only because I was forced to. There's no one here who could handle it, so I started to look into some of our most common heavy weapons and came across a few tricks how to improve them. Most of the time, they work and it has been very long since someone had one of my guns explode in their hands.}
{900}{}{是的，但只是因为我被迫这么做。这里没有人能处理，所以我开始研究一些我们最常见的重型武器，并想出了一些如何改进它们的窍门。大多数时候，他们工作，已经很长时间没有人有我的枪在他们手中爆炸。}
#{901}{}{Could you modify one of my guns?}
{901}{}{你能改装一下我的枪吗？}
#{902}{}{I better be going.}
{902}{}{我最好走了。}
#{950}{}{Not really, I don't have time for that at the moment.}
{950}{}{不是，我现在没有时间。}
#{951}{}{What are you working on at the moment?}
{951}{}{你现在在做什么？}
#{952}{}{OK.}
{952}{}{好 啊。}
#{1000}{}{Be my guest, but fixing it's not the issue, it's the missing part.}
{1000}{}{不客气，但修复不是问题，而是缺失的部分。}
#{1001}{}{What part is that?}
{1001}{}{那是什么部分？}
#{1002}{}{OK.}
{1002}{}{好 啊。}
#{1050}{}{There's no use in describing it to you, coming across something like that would be a small miracle. Forget about it, I'll have to think around the issue.}
{1050}{}{向你描述它是没有用的，遇到这样的事情会是一个小小的奇迹。算了吧，我得考虑一下这个问题。}
#{1051}{}{We'll see about that.}
{1051}{}{我们拭目以待。}
#{1100}{}{Nope, I don't have time for chatter.}
{1100}{}{不，我没有时间闲聊。}
#{1101}{}{What are you working on?}
{1101}{}{你在做什么？}
#{1102}{}{OK.}
{1102}{}{好 啊。}

#{1155}{}{Uh.}
{1155}{}{休斯敦大学。}
#{1200}{}{You actually repaired the generator! I wouldn't believe that part could be just bought. You just saved me a lot of work. Is there any way I can help you?}

#{1350}{}{Let me have a look at what you got. [He goes through your stuff.] Right, I think I could improve this a little bit.}
{1350}{}{让我看看你有什么。[他检查了你的东西]对，我想我可以改进一下。}
#{1351}{}{[Give him the flamethrower.]}
{1351}{}{[把喷火器给他。]}

{1352}{}{[把微型枪给他。]}
#{1353}{}{[Give him the flamethrower fuel.]}
{1353}{}{[给他喷火器燃料。]}
#{1354}{}{Forget about it.}
{1354}{}{算了吧。}
#{1400}{}{Let me have a look at what you got. [He goes through your stuff.] Nope, you don't have any gun I have experience with. I only have a chance playing around with common heavy guns.}
{1400}{}{让我看看你有什么。[他检查了你的东西]不，你没有我用过的枪。我只有机会玩普通的重枪。}
#{1401}{}{Never mind.}
{1401}{}{不要介意。}
#{1450}{}{Here you go. [He hands you the modified gun.] Even if I already did this type of modification, I still recommend you test the gun somewhere first, before you use it in combat.}
{1450}{}{干得好。[他把改装过的枪递给你]即使我已经做过这种改装，我还是建议你先在某处测试一下枪，然后再在战斗中使用它。}
#{1451}{}{OK.}
{1451}{}{好 啊。}
#{1452}{}{Yeah, perhaps I can try it on you, muhehe!}
{1452}{}{是啊，也许我可以给你试试，木鹤！}

#{1551}{}{OK.}
{1551}{}{好 啊。}
#{1600}{}{You actually managed to repair the generator! Thanks, buddy, you just saved me a lot of work. I've been trying to come up with a way to get it working for a long time. I didn't believe that part could be acquired somewhere.}
