#{301}{}{Tim's got enough.}
{301}{}{蒂姆已经够了。}
#{302}{}{Don't even try it. You won't get me to another bar no more.}
{302}{}{别试了。你不会再让我去别的酒吧了。}
#{450}{}{Why are you doing this?}
{450}{}{你为什么这么做？}
#{500}{}{[Tim lifts his head from the box full of old documents he was just going through and looks at you, clearly agitated.] Oh well, what do you need from me? Can't you see I'm very busy?}
{500}{}{[蒂姆从装满旧文件的盒子里抬起头，看着你，显然很激动。]哦，你需要我做什么？你没看见我很忙吗？}
#{501}{}{It'll be just a minute. Tell me about Frederyk.}
{501}{}{就一会儿。跟我说说弗雷德里克。}
#{502}{}{It won't take long. What do you know about the attacks on caravans?}

{504}{}{那我就不打扰你了。再见。}
#{505}{}{Uff.}
{505}{}{不明飞行物。}
#{550}{}{Frederyk's my boss. This whole company belongs to him. He built it practically out of nothing and brought it where it is now. I have great respect for him.}
{550}{}{弗雷德里克是我的老板。整个公司都属于他。他几乎是白手起家，把它带到了现在的地方。我非常尊敬他。}

#{553}{}{I see, I've got to go. Good-bye.}
{553}{}{我明白了，我得走了。再见。}
#{600}{}{The only thing I know is they're ruining us. Frederyk's Dream's already lost a lot of goods and capable guards because of them. I don't know how long we can last.}
{600}{}{我只知道他们在毁了我们。弗雷德里克的梦想已经因为他们失去了很多货物和能干的守卫。我不知道我们还能坚持多久。}
#{601}{}{Hmm, tell me about Frederyk.}
{601}{}{嗯，跟我说说弗雷德里克。}
#{602}{}{How about we two go to a bar?}
{602}{}{我们两个去酒吧怎么样？}
#{603}{}{Got it. I've got to go, good-bye.}
{603}{}{知道了。我得走了，再见。}
#{650}{}{I'm sorry but that won't do. I've got things I need to finish. Besides, I'm not on very good terms with alcohol.}
{650}{}{对不起，那不行。我有些事要完成。另外，我和酒精关系不太好。}
#{651}{}{Come on, a little fun time will only do you good. Frederyk would surely agree. What do you say?}
{651}{}{来吧，一点快乐的时光只会对你有好处。弗雷德里克肯定会同意的。你怎么说？}
#{652}{}{Your loss. Good-bye.}
{652}{}{你的损失。再见。}
#{700}{}{Uh... It'd be nice to take a break from all those papers. Yes, why not, let's go out. But just for a while. No one'll check the accounts for me.}
{700}{}{休斯敦大学。。。从那些报纸上休息一下就好了。是的，为什么不呢，我们出去吧。但只是暂时的。没人会帮我查账的。}
#{701}{}{That's the spirit. Let's go!}
{701}{}{这就是精神。走吧！}
#{750}{}{[Tim brings you to the Crater.] I'm here for the first time myself, but our caravan guards won't say half an ugly word about this place. What shall we have?}
{750}{}{[蒂姆带你到火山口来]我自己第一次来这里，但是我们的商队警卫不会对这个地方说半点难听的话。我们吃什么？}

{752}{}{朗姆酒。}

{754}{}{我刚意识到我身上的瓶盖不够多。}
#{800}{}{Oh well, then go and get some. I'll wait for you for a while. But don't be too long. There's a lot of work waiting for me at Frederyk's Dream.}
{800}{}{好吧，那就去买点吧。我等你一会儿。但不要太久。弗雷德里克的梦里有很多工作等着我。}
#{801}{}{I'll be right back.}
{801}{}{我马上回来。}
#{850}{}{[The contents of the first glass disappeared in your throat and the others soon followed... You don't have a clear idea how long you two have been drinking, but Tim's evidently getting to his limits. His face has paled and he speaks with great difficulty. It seems to you it's the time to start your investigation.]}
{850}{}{[第一杯的内容物消失在你的喉咙里，其他的很快就跟着消失了。。。你不清楚你们俩喝酒多久了，但蒂姆显然已经到了极限了。他脸色苍白，说话很困难。在你看来是时候开始调查了}
#{851}{}{Tim! Look... Tim! Tell me what you really think of Frederyk!}
{851}{}{提姆！看。。。提姆！告诉我你对弗雷德里克的真实看法！}
#{852}{}{Listen... How is it really with those raiders?}
{852}{}{听。。。那些袭击者到底怎么样？}
#{900}{}{[Tim gets even paler and gulps down.] He's... a good boss... I don't have nuffin 'gainst... [He gulps down again.]}
{900}{}{[蒂姆脸色更苍白，大口喝了下去]他。。。一个好老板。。。我可没办法。。。[他又咽了下去。]}
#{901}{}{Look here... How is it really with those raiders?}
{901}{}{看这里。。。那些袭击者到底怎么样？}
#{950}{}{I dunno... I dunno nuffin! [He gulps down.]}
{950}{}{我不知道。。。我不知道，努芬！[他狼吞虎咽]}
#{951}{}{And Tim! Look... Tim! Tell me what you really think of Frederyk!}
{951}{}{还有蒂姆！看。。。提姆！告诉我你对弗雷德里克的真实看法！}
#{1000}{}{I dunno... I know nuff... [Tim can't fight it anymore. He throws up and falls to the floor.]}
{1000}{}{我不知道。。。我知道努夫。。。[蒂姆再也不能反抗了。他吐了起来，摔倒在地上}
#{1001}{}{[Uhrp.] I guess that's all I'll get from him.}

#{1200}{}{Uh, you again? Don't even think about it. I'm not going to any bar with you. I've had enough the last time for the rest of my life.}
{1200}{}{你又来了？想都别想。我不会和你去任何酒吧的。我这辈子已经受够了最后一次了。}
#{1201}{}{That's not why I'm here. Frederyk offered me a little job out of town. He says you're to go with me.}
{1201}{}{这不是我来这里的原因。弗雷德里克给了我一份外地的小工作。他说你和我一起去。}
#{1202}{}{Shut up and follow me. Or else I'll kill you.}
{1202}{}{闭嘴跟我来。否则我就杀了你。}
#{1203}{}{OK, relax. Bye, Tim.}

{1206}{}{弗雷德里克派我来的。他给了我一份外地的小工作。他说你和我一起去。}
#{1250}{}{[Tim gives you a frightened nod.] Fine. I'll do what you say. Just don't hurt me.}
{1250}{}{[蒂姆吓得点了点头]好吧。我会照你说的做。别伤害我。}
#{1251}{}{Good thinking. Let's move! [Set out for the desert with Tim.]}
{1251}{}{好主意。我们走！[和蒂姆一起去沙漠。]}
#{1300}{}{What is it you're trying to do?! The closest cop to us is just feet away. Leave me be, and immediately. Before I call someone on you!}

#{1301}{}{Calm down, Tim. I'm leaving.}
{1301}{}{冷静点，蒂姆。我要走了。}
#{1302}{}{What are you going to do to me? Show me!}
{1302}{}{你要对我做什么？向我展示！}
#{1350}{}{[A surprised expression shows on his face.] Frederyk has never asked me to go out of town. Didn't he mention why me?}
{1350}{}{[脸上露出惊讶的表情]弗雷德里克从来没有让我出城。他没提为什么是我吗？}
#{1351}{}{He didn't say anything. But he gave me a commission for you, 100 caps. I guess he really needs you there.}
{1351}{}{他什么也没说。但他给了我一笔佣金，100个瓶盖。我想他真的需要你。}
#{1352}{}{That's none of your business! Come with me or I'll kill you!}

{1353}{}{知道吗，算了吧。再见，蒂姆。}
#{1400}{}{[He takes the caps from you, clearly full of doubts.] I'm sure Frederyk has a good reason for this. OK, then. We can go.}
{1400}{}{[他拿走了你的瓶盖，显然充满了怀疑]我相信弗雷德里克有充分的理由这样做。那好吧。我们可以走了。}
#{1401}{}{That's the spirit, Tim. Let's go. [Set out for the desert with Tim.]}
{1401}{}{这就是精神，蒂姆。走吧。[和蒂姆一起去沙漠。]}
#{1450}{}{Don't think I forgot about your threats. Please leave, right now!}
{1450}{}{别以为我忘了你的威胁。请马上离开！}
#{1451}{}{Sorry, Tim. I don't know why I acted like that the last time. Listen, Frederyk offered me a little job out of town. He says you're to go with me.}
{1451}{}{抱歉，蒂姆。我不知道我上次为什么那样做。听着，弗雷德里克给了我一份外地的工作。他说你和我一起去。}
#{1452}{}{I don't want to go anywhere. What're you going to do about it, asshole?}

#{1500}{}{I'm supposed to go out of town with you?! Frederyk must have lost his mind to choose you for a job. Or did you threaten him as well? [Tim waves his hand with anger.] Didn't he at least say why you should take me in particular?}

{1551}{}{弗雷德里克要你永远离开塞迪特。所以别再回来了。}
#{1552}{}{You got it right, loser. You're going to die, right here where you're standing.}
{1552}{}{你说得对，失败者。你会死的，就在你站的地方。}
#{1600}{}{But why? I've been working for Frederyk for years and I have never done anything to harm his company. What's his reason to expel me all of a sudden?}
{1600}{}{但为什么呢？我已经为弗雷德里克工作多年了，我从来没有做过任何伤害他的公司的事。他为什么突然开除我？}
#{1601}{}{That's none of your business. You can be glad I'm going to let you live. Now make like a bee and buzz off. Before I change my mind.}
{1601}{}{那不关你的事。你很高兴我能让你活下来。现在像蜜蜂一样飞起来。在我改变主意之前。}
#{1602}{}{Jeremy provided one that's really good. Now get lost.}
{1602}{}{杰里米提供了一个非常好的。现在滚开。}
#{1603}{}{I've had enough, Tim. I think I'll have to take you down.}
{1603}{}{我受够了，蒂姆。我想我得把你干掉。}
#{1650}{}{I don't understand, I don't understand any of it. I don't know why you're doing this but you won't get away with it!}

#{1651}{}{I already have, Tim. [Let him leave.]}
{1651}{}{我已经有了，蒂姆。[让他离开。]}

{1701}{}{我们已经有时间了。[让他离开。]}
#{1750}{}{[You are in the middle of a plain stretching to the horizon in all directions. The long journey by foot got the best out of Tim. Now he's looking in all directions, getting jumpier by the second.] What's going to happen now? There's nothing here. Don't tell me we came here for nothing.}
{1750}{}{[你正处在一片平原的中央，向四面八方延伸到地平线。徒步长途旅行使蒂姆受益匪浅。现在他向四面八方张望，一秒钟就变得更紧张了？这里什么都没有。别告诉我我们是白来的。}

{2259}{}{努芬，呸！}
#{2300}{}{I've been told you took to heels during the journey. How could you do that? Your cowardice endangered the goods and other guards. They were lucky to manage the rest of the journey without you. [He sighs.] I won't hold it against you this time, but it must never happen again.}
{2300}{}{有人告诉我你在旅途中很紧张。你怎么能这么做？你的怯懦危及货物和其他警卫。他们很幸运，剩下的旅程没有你。[他叹了口气]这次我不反对你，但决不能再这样了。}

#{2302}{}{Thank you for another chance. Good-bye, Tim.}
{2302}{}{谢谢你再给我一次机会。再见，蒂姆。}
#{2303}{}{Uff.}
{2303}{}{不明飞行物。}
#{2304}{}{I've been told you left the caravan again. That's intolerable. You won't be given another chance in this company.}
{2304}{}{我听说你又离开大篷车了。这太让人无法忍受了。你在这家公司再也没有机会了。}
#{2305}{}{I've been told you left the caravan again. That's intolerable. You won't be given another chance in this company.}

#{2306}{}{As you wish, Tim. Good-bye.}
{2306}{}{如你所愿，蒂姆。再见。}
#{3000}{}{Wait. I've heard you're not very popular there. I'm sorry but I won't let you go there with one of my caravans. I don't want to cross the locals.}
{3000}{}{等待。我听说你在那里不太受欢迎。对不起，我不会让你和我的一辆大篷车一起去的。我不想冒犯当地人。}
#{3001}{}{Ah.}
{3001}{}{啊。}
#{3002}{}{Uff.}
{3002}{}{不明飞行物。}
#{3050}{}{[Tim seems to be out of sorts, lost in his thoughts. He only notices you when you beckon his attention for the second time.] Oh, hi. I'm sorry, I'm very busy. Sometimes I feel like I've got too much to do. We've lost a whole brahmin herd recently. Someone just killed them.}
{3050}{}{[蒂姆似乎心情不好，陷入了沉思。他只在你第二次吸引他的注意时才注意到你。对不起，我很忙。有时我觉得我有太多的事要做。我们最近失去了一整群双头牛人。有人刚刚杀了他们。}

#{3052}{}{That's horrible...}
{3052}{}{太可怕了。。。}
#{3053}{}{Bad.}
{3053}{}{糟糕。}
#{3100}{}{You've got no idea. The merchants already started to cancel settled deals. They say they don't believe we can take care of their goods. And with a smaller number of brahmins, we can't afford to take up many offers, anyway. So I had to lower caravan guards' wages. But I don't want to burden you with my problems. How can I help you?}
{3100}{}{你不知道。商家已经开始取消已结算的交易。他们说他们不相信我们能照顾好他们的货物。由于双头牛人数较少，我们无论如何也承受不起许多邀请。所以我不得不降低商队警卫的工资。但我不想给你添麻烦。我能帮你什么？}
#{3101}{}{Tell me about the caravans.}
{3101}{}{告诉我关于商队的事。}
#{3102}{}{And I just wanted to get hired as a caravan guard.}
{3102}{}{我只想被雇来当一名商队警卫。}
#{3103}{}{Would it be possible for other passengers to join a caravan?}
{3103}{}{其他乘客有可能加入商队吗？}
#{3104}{}{Did anyone order a private caravan with your company?}
{3104}{}{有没有人在你公司订了一辆私人大篷车？}
#{3105}{}{That's okay, thanks. Good-bye.}
