#{600}{}{Hey! Before you go, perhaps you could do me a favor. I'm supposed to bring this machine part to Max in the basement copy room. But you see, my left knee has been acting up lately, and it's a real pain for me to go up and down all those stairs. Would it trouble you too much to bring him this part for me?}
