#{100}{}{You see a representative.}
{100}{}{你看到一个代表。}
#{101}{}{You see a serious-looking man sent on another's behalf.}
{101}{}{你看到一个表情严肃的人被派去替别人做事。}
#{102}{}{We're done here.}
{102}{}{我们到此为止。}
#{103}{}{Who are you?}
{103}{}{你是谁？}
#{104}{}{I represent Mr. Thompson. We know about your deal with Stryker's gang and wish to present a counter-offer.}
{104}{}{我代表汤普森先生。我们知道你方与史崔克团伙的交易，希望还盘。}
#{105}{}{I know about your arrangement with Stryker. I suggest you to reconsider.}
{105}{}{我知道你和史崔克的安排。我建议你重新考虑一下。}
#{106}{}{I'm here to prevent your business with Stryker. Permanently. [Attack]}
{106}{}{我是来阻止你和史崔克做生意的。永久地。[攻击]}
#{107}{}{I like my terms with Stryker. Why should I switch?}
{107}{}{我喜欢我和史崔克的关系。我为什么要换？}
#{108}{}{Stryker is dead. His gang can't do it without him. The fact that I even got to you is proof they don't know what they're doing.}
{108}{}{史崔克死了。没有他，他的帮派做不到。我找到你的事实证明他们不知道自己在做什么。}
#{109}{}{Because Thompson's going to win this war, very soon. When he does, he'll take control of all the drug dealers. Do you really think one chemist on Stryker's side is going to make a difference?}
{109}{}{因为汤普森很快就会赢得这场战争。当他这么做的时候，他会控制所有的毒贩。你真的认为史崔克那边的一个药剂师会起作用吗？}
#{110}{}{You make a good case. Alright, I'm in. Tell Thompson to send someone to hash out the details.}
{110}{}{你的理由很充分。好吧，我加入了。告诉汤普森派个人把细节搞清楚。}
#{111}{}{Good. I hope you're not planning on playing both sides...}
{111}{}{很好。我希望你不打算两边都打...}
#{112}{}{Really?}
{112}{}{真的？}
#{113}{}{Just a warning, that's all. I'm leaving.}
{113}{}{只是个警告而已。我要走了。}
#{114}{}{You do this, and Mr. Thompson won't forget it. Trust me, he's a much more fearsome enemy than Stryker. One chemist on Stryker's side won't give him the strength to protect you.}
{114}{}{你这样做，汤普森先生不会忘记的。相信我，他比史崔克更可怕。史崔克那边的一个化学家不会给他力量来保护你。}
#{115}{}{Uh... Well, Thompson's just way cooler than Stryker, don't you think?}
{115}{}{Uh...汤普森比史崔克酷多了，你不觉得吗？}
#{116}{}{This is childish. Leave.}
{116}{}{这太幼稚了。离开。}
#{117}{}{Well, I warned you.}
{117}{}{我警告过你了。}
#{1106}{}{I'm here to prevent your business with Stryker. Permanently. [Attack]}

#{1113}{}{Just a warning, that's all. I'm leaving.}

#{1117}{}{Well, I warned you.}
{1117}{}{我警告过你了。}
