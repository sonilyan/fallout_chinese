{120}{}{嘿。还在制造弹药。还得坚持很久。 -- Hey. Still making ammo here. Still gonna be making it for a long, long time.}
#{121}{}{Oh yeah, just get some fresh ammo off the ammo tree! Why didn't I think of that? [he rolls his eyes] Reno's police went through all of its ammunition in the first years after the war.

{121}{}{哦，是的，从弹药树上拿些新鲜的弹药！我怎么没想到呢？[他翻白眼]雷诺的警察在战后头几年检查了所有的弹药。从那以后我们发现的任何东西都在过去十年的内战中被销毁了。要一把能用的枪已经够难了，更不用说弹药了。我们从探矿者和商队那里买我们能买的东西，但我们仍然要让每一颗子弹都有价值。 -- Oh yeah, just get some fresh ammo off the ammo tree!
