#{552}{}{Wanda sent me. She would like to employ you.}
{552}{}{万达派我来的。她想雇用你。}
#{553}{}{It's nothing.}
{553}{}{没什么。}
#{600}{}{Bill is in the mines, of course. He's a miner.}
{600}{}{比尔当然在矿井里。他是个矿工。}
#{601}{}{Not another miner.}
{601}{}{不是别的矿工。}
#{602}{}{Thanks, goodbye.}
{602}{}{谢谢，再见。}
#{650}{}{Of course. It is the only employment in Corath for a man who isn't a gun nut, or violence freak. [She looks at you as if she only now realized who she was speaking to.] Uh, I'm sorry, I don't wish to offend you.}
{650}{}{当然。这是科拉斯唯一一个不喜欢持枪或暴力的人的工作。[她看着你，好像现在才意识到她在和谁说话似的]呃，对不起，我不想冒犯你。}
#{651}{}{That's alright. Goodbye.}
{651}{}{没关系。再见。}
#{652}{}{I'll show you what kind of a violence freak I am, bitch!}
{652}{}{我会告诉你我是什么样的暴力狂，婊子！}
#{700}{}{There is a strike in the mines, so Bill's at the bar until things get straightened out.}

#{701}{}{Not another miner.}
{701}{}{不是别的矿工。}
#{702}{}{Thanks, goodbye.}
{702}{}{谢谢，再见。}
#{750}{}{My word, what impudence! I've been harassed by every other man because I look a lot like my sister, and now this! She brought my sister to that awful work and now she wants to do the same to me!}
{750}{}{我的话，真是厚颜无耻！我一直被其他男人骚扰，因为我长得很像我妹妹，现在这个！她把我妹妹带到那糟糕的工作中，现在她也想对我做同样的事！}
#{751}{}{What can you tell me about your sister?}
{751}{}{你能告诉我关于你妹妹的什么情况吗？}
#{752}{}{So you're not interested?}
{752}{}{所以你不感兴趣？}
#{753}{}{I see. Well, I'll be going now.}
{753}{}{我懂了。好吧，我现在就走。}
#{800}{}{Of course not! I have no intention of doing anything like that. And I don't have to, either. I have a man who takes good care of me. And he wouldn't allow it, anyway.}
{800}{}{当然不是！我无意做那样的事。我也不需要。我有一个很照顾我的男人。反正他也不允许。}
#{801}{}{How is your life?}

#{850}{}{What are you suggesting? Miners' wages are very low, but Bill works that much harder. So we get by.}
{850}{}{你有什么建议？矿工的工资很低，但比尔工作更努力了。所以我们过得去。}
#{851}{}{You're a very pretty woman, just like your sister. Together you could make so much money you could afford anything you like. And in my book that makes it worth your while to leave a miner with a lousy wage.}
{851}{}{你是个很漂亮的女人，就像你姐姐一样。你们可以一起赚很多钱，买得起任何你喜欢的东西。在我的书中，你值得留下一个工资很低的矿工。}
#{852}{}{And your sister? Can you tell me about her?}
{852}{}{你妹妹呢？你能告诉我她的情况吗？}
#{853}{}{Where can I find Bill?}
{853}{}{我在哪能找到比尔？}
#{854}{}{As you wish. Goodbye.}
{854}{}{如你所愿。再见。}
#{900}{}{Abby really isn't that bad. She took that job because she didn't have an alternative. I was luckier. Bill has many flaws, but at least he provides for the two of us. You know, perhaps you could help Abby.}
{900}{}{艾比真的没那么坏。她接受那份工作是因为她别无选择。我更幸运。比尔有很多缺点，但至少他能养活我们两个。你知道，也许你可以帮助艾比。}

#{903}{}{I'm not helping anybody. Goodbye.}
{903}{}{我没有帮助任何人。再见。}
#{950}{}{To sell myself? That wouldn't be right, surely.}
{950}{}{出卖我自己？那肯定不对。}
#{951}{}{It seems to me it wouldn't be so different from the life you're leading now. Admit it: you don't feel anything for Bill. You're with him only because he provides a so-so living. Or am I wrong?}
{951}{}{在我看来，这和你现在的生活没什么不同。承认吧：你对比尔一点感觉都没有。你和他在一起只是因为他提供了一个很好的生活。还是我错了？}
#{1000}{}{Well... Actually, that's true. Sometimes he revolts me. I suppose it wouldn't be that different, and at least I would make a lot of money.}
{1000}{}{好。。。事实上，这是真的。有时他令我反感。我想不会有什么不同，至少我会赚很多钱。}
#{1001}{}{Fine. Let me help you pack, and you can be off to Wanda's.}
{1001}{}{好的。我帮你收拾行李，你就可以去万达了。}
#{1050}{}{Won't you convince her to drop that awful work? If she wants, she can live with us. I'll arrange it with Bill. And I'll pay you, of course, if you can convince her. I myself would surely succeed, but I'm not setting foot in that horrible place. What would the people say?}
{1050}{}{你不能说服她放弃那糟糕的工作吗？如果她愿意，她可以和我们住在一起。我会和比尔安排的。当然，如果你能说服她，我会付钱给你的。我自己肯定会成功，但我不会踏上那个可怕的地方。人们会怎么说？}
#{1051}{}{How much will you pay me?}
{1051}{}{你要付我多少钱？}
#{1052}{}{Wouldn't you rather earn as much money as your sister?}
{1052}{}{你不想挣和你姐姐一样多的钱吗？}
#{1053}{}{I'm not convincing anyone. Goodbye.}
{1053}{}{我不能说服任何人。再见。}
#{1100}{}{I'll give you 250 caps. That's really more than we can afford, but I'm willing to make that sacrifice for the sake of my sister.}
{1100}{}{我给你250个瓶盖。这确实超出了我们的承受能力，但为了我妹妹，我愿意做出牺牲。}
#{1101}{}{Alright, I'll try to convince her.}
{1101}{}{好吧，我试着说服她。}
#{1102}{}{Wouldn't you rather earn as much money as your sister?}
{1102}{}{你不想挣和你姐姐一样多的钱吗？}
#{1103}{}{I'm not convincing anyone. Goodbye.}
{1103}{}{我不能说服任何人。再见。}
#{1150}{}{Abby really isn't that bad. She took that job because she did't have an alternative. I was luckier. Bill has many flaws, but at least he provides for the two of us. You know, perhaps you could help Abby.}

#{1203}{}{Are you sure you wouldn't like to work for Wanda?}

#{1205}{}{I'm not doing anything.}

#{1252}{}{Not yet.}
{1252}{}{还没有。}
#{1253}{}{Ugh.}
{1253}{}{啊。}

{1304}{}{如你所愿。再见。}
#{1350}{}{How wonderful that you've managed to convince Abby. She really quit! Now she'll live decently, with us. I'd like to thank you, but perhaps it wouldn't mean anything to you. You'll get your 250 caps, as promised. Here they are.}
{1350}{}{你能说服艾比真是太好了。她真的辞职了！现在她将体面地和我们一起生活。我很想谢谢你，但也许这对你没什么意义。你会如约拿到250顶瓶盖。他们来了。}

{1351}{}{谢谢，再见。}

#{1400}{}{How wonderful that you've managed to convince Abby. She really quit! Now she'll live decently, with us. I'd like to thank you, but perhaps it wouldn't mean anything to you. You'll get your 250 caps, as promised. Here they are.}

#{1450}{}{It was clever to pay her for a week with us. I'm sure I'll manage to convince her to stay with us forever in that time, whether she likes it or not. I don't know if this is profitable for you, but I promised you 250 caps, so here they are. I cannot give you any more than that.}
{1450}{}{付钱给她和我们在一起一个星期是明智的。不管她喜不喜欢，我肯定能说服她在那段时间里永远和我们在一起。我不知道这是否对你有利，但我答应给你250个上限，所以给你。我不能给你更多。}
