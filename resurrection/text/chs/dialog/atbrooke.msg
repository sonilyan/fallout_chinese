#{1200}{}{Yes, Elisa... I mean, the empress... Dissolved the council. It's understandable. It became clear that you can't trust the loyalty of the council members, and there's a lack of blood relatives regardless. Still, it's quite a drastic move in our history. Anyway, as far as I know, the leadership of the hospital is still open to Lystra.}
