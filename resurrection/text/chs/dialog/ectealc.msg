#{900}{}{It just looks like it. It's designed for intimidation.}
{900}{}{看起来就是这样。是用来恐吓的。}
#{901}{}{It really looks like a spear. Where did you get it from?}
{901}{}{它看起来真像一支长矛。你从哪儿弄来的？}
#{902}{}{If it's not a spear, what ammo does it use?}
{902}{}{如果不是长矛，用什么弹药？}
#{950}{}{It's a Goa'uld weapon.}
{950}{}{这是果阿乌尔德的武器。}
#{951}{}{So it's really not a spear? Then I guess that's explanation enough.}
{951}{}{所以它真的不是长矛？那我想这就足够了。}
#{952}{}{Who are these Goa'ulds?}
{952}{}{这些果阿人是谁？}

{1152}{}{我能问你关于那长矛的事吗。。。呃，我是说那把棍子武器？}
#{1200}{}{Goa'ulds are parasites, who rule over people by posing as gods. The one and only meaning of their life is to have power.}

#{1400}{}{The basis of their army consists of Jaffas armed with staff weapons, zat'nik'tels, and grenades. Bases are protected by cannons and towers. For both the planetary attack and defense they utilize attack aircrafts that take off from motherships or fly through gates. For the invasion they use al'kesh bombers.}
{1400}{}{他们的军队的基础是武装着参谋武器的贾法人、扎特尼克和手榴弹。基地由大炮和塔楼保护。对于行星攻击和防御，他们都使用从母舰起飞或穿过大门的攻击飞机。他们用艾尔凯什轰炸机进行入侵。}
#{1401}{}{So their strategy is based on massive deployment?}
{1401}{}{所以他们的战略是基于大规模部署？}
#{1402}{}{Tell me more about their motherships.}
{1402}{}{告诉我更多关于他们母舰的事。}
#{1403}{}{Tell me more about Jaffas.}
{1403}{}{告诉我更多关于Jaffas的事。}
#{1404}{}{OK. And what about their infrastructure?}
{1404}{}{好 啊。他们的基础设施呢？}
#{1450}{}{Their power is centralized in the hands of a couple of system rulers. These rulers fight against each other quite a lot, but sometimes they make alliances. They maintain the government on conquered planets through Jaffas and priests. They appoint subordinate Goa'ulds for important positions. They provide connections through chaapa'ai or motherships and tel'taks.}
{1450}{}{他们的权力集中在两个系统统治者手中。这些统治者经常互相争斗，但有时他们结成联盟。他们通过雅法和牧师在被征服的星球上维持政府。他们任命下属果阿人担任要职。它们通过chaapa'ai或母舰和电话提供连接。}
#{1451}{}{Chaapa'ai?}
{1451}{}{查帕艾？}
#{1452}{}{Mothership?}
{1452}{}{母舰？}
#{1453}{}{Tel'taks?}

#{1454}{}{OK. And what about their army?}

#{1550}{}{Soon it will be one hundred and three years since I was born.}
{1550}{}{很快我就要一百零三年了。}
#{1551}{}{Wow! How do you do it? Do you maintain a diet, do jogging, are you a vegan, or what?}
{1551}{}{哇！你是怎么做到的？你有没有节食，慢跑，你是素食主义者，还是什么？}
#{1600}{}{Yes. The life of a Jaffa means nothing to them. But for special attacks they use ashraks, specially trained Goa'ulds.}
{1600}{}{对。贾法的生活对他们来说毫无意义。但对于特殊的攻击，他们使用灰烬，特别训练的果阿ULD。}
#{1601}{}{Tell me more about Jaffas.}
{1601}{}{告诉我更多关于Jaffas的事。}
#{1650}{}{Motherships, called hat'tak, usually have hundreds of Jaffas on board, dozens of jet fighters, and a lot of tel'taks and al'keshs. Each command ship contains a gate.}
{1650}{}{母船，被称为hat'tak，通常有数百架jaffa，几十架喷气式战斗机，以及许多tel'tak和al'keshs。每艘指挥舰都有一扇门。}
#{1651}{}{Tell me more about tel'taks.}
{1651}{}{告诉我更多关于泰德的事。}
#{1652}{}{What gates?}
{1652}{}{什么门？}
#{1653}{}{And what about their equipment?}
{1653}{}{他们的装备呢？}
#{1700}{}{Jaffas are slaves to Goa'ulds. They serve them as warriors and as incubators, because they carry a symbiotic larva inside. This symbiote is a pinnacle of slavery, because without it, a Jaffa dies.}
{1700}{}{贾法人是果阿ULD的奴隶。它们充当战士和孵化器，因为它们体内携带着共生的幼虫。这种共生关系是奴隶制的顶峰，因为没有它，一个Jaffa就会死去。}
#{1701}{}{Tell me more about the symbiote.}
{1701}{}{告诉我更多关于共生体的事。}
#{1702}{}{Thanks, that's enough.}
{1702}{}{谢谢，够了。}
#{1750}{}{It is a way to travel between the worlds. Major Carter will tell you more about it.}
{1750}{}{这是一种在世界之间旅行的方式。卡特少校会告诉你更多的。}
#{1751}{}{So I should pay her a visit.}
{1751}{}{所以我应该去拜访她。}
#{1752}{}{So I should pay her a visit.}

{1800}{}{泰德。货船。}
#{1801}{}{Tell me about other stuff.}
{1801}{}{告诉我其他的事情。}
#{1850}{}{I've got prim'ta.}
{1850}{}{我已经准备好了。}
#{1851}{}{I will now ask you, what it is, and so help you God, if you answer me with two words...!}
{1851}{}{我现在要问你，这是什么，上帝保佑你，如果你用两个字回答我。。。！}
#{1852}{}{What is it?}
{1852}{}{这是怎么一回事？}
#{1900}{}{These ships travel much faster than the speed of light, they are protected by strong shield and they have a lot of defensive weapons. Their attack weapons are dreadful, they are able to destroy whole city with a few shots.}
{1900}{}{这些飞船的速度比光速快得多，它们被坚固的盾牌保护着，而且它们有很多防御武器。他们的攻击武器很可怕，几枪就能摧毁整个城市。}
#{1901}{}{I cannot even imagine it.}
{1901}{}{我甚至无法想象。}
#{1902}{}{But if we infect them with a computer virus, maybe it would put down the shields.}
{1902}{}{但如果我们用电脑病毒感染他们，也许会放下防护罩。}
#{1950}{}{The Goa'ulds reproduce by the queen giving birth to many larvae. They must live in a liquid environment, until they evolve. Then they look for a host. The chance that the host and the symbiote merge is fifty percent. But if the larva matures in an the abdominal pouch of a Jaffa, the success rate is higher.}
{1950}{}{果阿ULD由女王繁殖，并产下许多幼虫。它们必须生活在液态环境中，直到进化。然后他们找一个主人。宿主和共生体合并的几率是百分之五十。但是，如果幼虫在Jaffa的腹袋中成熟，成功率更高。}
#{1951}{}{So, basically, you carry inside of you a child of your enemy?}
{1951}{}{所以，基本上，你体内携带着你敌人的孩子？}
#{2000}{}{A Goa'uld larva.}
{2000}{}{果阿的幼虫。}
#{2001}{}{A child of your enemy helps you survive?}
{2001}{}{你的敌人的孩子能帮助你生存？}
#{2050}{}{According to your scale the blasts of Goa'uld weapons reach the power of 200 megatons. Land after an attack looks similar to the land around us.}
{2050}{}{根据你的规模，果阿乌尔德武器的威力达到200兆吨。攻击后的陆地看起来和我们周围的陆地很相似。}
#{2051}{}{So the power of one mothership equals the destructiveness of a total nuclear war?}
{2051}{}{那么一艘母舰的力量就等于一场全面核战争的毁灭性？}
#{2052}{}{No. I don't believe that.}
{2052}{}{不，我不相信。}
#{2100}{}{It doesn't seem possible to me. Really, you shouldn't even think about it.}
{2100}{}{在我看来这是不可能的。真的，你根本不应该去想。}
#{2101}{}{OK. Tell me more about Jaffas.}
{2101}{}{好 啊。告诉我更多关于Jaffas的事。}
#{2102}{}{You're wrong! I will think about it, goodbye.}
{2102}{}{你错了！我会考虑的，再见。}
#{2150}{}{Yes.}
{2150}{}{对。}
#{2151}{}{That's terrible. Is there any way to get rid of it?}
{2151}{}{太可怕了。有没有办法摆脱它？}
#{2200}{}{Yes.}
{2200}{}{对。}
#{2201}{}{Damn. That's a fact to think about. Thank you, my friend, for broadening my knowledge.}
{2201}{}{该死。这是一个值得思考的事实。谢谢你，我的朋友，你拓宽了我的知识面。}
#{2250}{}{[Raises one eyebrow.]}
{2250}{}{[扬起眉毛]}
#{2251}{}{Enough with the empty chatter! I've got work to do. Goodbye.}
{2251}{}{闲聊够了！我有工作要做。再见。}
#{2300}{}{We are trying various approaches, but without any effect yet. I believe though, that one day my people will be free.}
{2300}{}{我们正在尝试各种方法，但还没有任何效果。我相信，总有一天我的人民会自由的。}
#{2301}{}{Sure, the American dream... Blah, blah, blah...}
{2301}{}{当然，美国梦。。。废话，废话，废话。。。}
#{2350}{}{I'm glad to help.}
{2350}{}{我很乐意帮忙。}
#{2351}{}{Goodbye.}
{2351}{}{再见。}
