#{100}{}{You see the sheriff.}
{100}{}{你去见警长。}
#{101}{}{You see Burton "Whip" Hickok, the sheriff of Salt Lake City.}
{101}{}{你看到伯顿“鞭子”希科克，盐湖城的治安官。}
#{102}{}{Excuse me, what is this place?}
{102}{}{打扰一下，这是什么地方？}
#{103}{}{I really need to pay my attention to education in these parts, if so many people fail to read the "Sheriff" sign at the entrance...}
{103}{}{我真的需要注意这些地方的教育，如果这么多人看不到入口处的“警长”标志。。。}
#{104}{}{Oh, it's the sheriff's office? And you are...}
{104}{}{哦，是警长办公室吗？你是。。。}
#{105}{}{I'm actually the sheriff himself. My name is Burton Hickok, but people sometimes call me "Whip". And to immediately answer the next question: Yes, my ancestor is *that* Hickok. And yes, I bring order by the whip... And the gun if it's necessary.}
{105}{}{我其实是警长本人。我叫伯顿・希科克，但人们有时叫我“鞭子”。然后马上回答下一个问题：是的，我的祖先是希科克。是的，我用鞭子命令。。。如果有必要的话，还有枪。}
#{106}{}{Okay, Sheriff Burton, now everything is clear to me.}
{106}{}{好了，伯顿警长，现在一切都清楚了。}
#{110}{}{So you caught the thief at the Quok brothers? You did the right thing. For a long time I've been cleaning out the city from all this dirt. But there are still bastards that are trying to turn Salt Lake into a shithole, hence we appreciate each victory of justice over lawlessness. On behalf of Salt Lake City, I express my gratitude for the help. I do not know what made you act, but I will not forget that. According to customs I should pay to you. $3000 is the amount that the traders would have lost, if it were not for you. Thanks again.}
{110}{}{你在库克兄弟抓到小偷了？你做得对。很长一段时间以来，我一直在清理城市里的灰尘。但仍有一些混蛋企图把盐湖变成粪坑，因此我们赞赏正义战胜无法无天的每一次胜利。我代表盐湖城对您的帮助表示感谢。我不知道是什么让你这么做，但我不会忘记的。按照惯例我应该付给你。如果不是你，3000美元是交易者可能损失的金额。再次感谢。}
#{111}{}{Wow! That is quite a fee!}
{111}{}{哇！那是相当高的费用！}
#{112}{}{Okay. Take this one to the cell, and this one we will release... [Turns to you] This is my first and last warning, only because you're the new person in town. I don't know what pushed you onto a dirty business, but we won't forgive you in the future. I'm sure you understand me. [stroking his gun] Now get out.}
{112}{}{可以。把这个带到牢房，我们会释放这个。。。[转向你]这是我第一次也是最后一次警告，只是因为你是城里的新人。我不知道是什么把你推上了肮脏的事业，但我们以后不会原谅你的。我相信你理解我。现在出去。}
#{113}{}{Damn, that was really messed up...}
{113}{}{妈的，真是一团糟。。。}
#{114}{}{So you are that elusive ghost? Oh, we had already heard rumors about your "exploits" beforehand. I don't why you are wanted for in the whole wasteland, but if you make problems in *my* city, *I* will be the one who rids the world from you. And now relax, that was a warning, the first *and* the last.}
{114}{}{你就是那个难以捉摸的鬼魂？哦，我们事先已经听说了关于你“功绩”的谣言。我不知道为什么你会在这片荒原上被通缉，但如果你在我的城市里制造麻烦，我将是那个把世界从你身边夺走的人。现在放松，这是一个警告，第一个和最后一个。}
#{115}{}{I understand, sheriff. You don't need to repeated yourself.}
{115}{}{我明白，警长。你不需要重复你自己。}
#{116}{}{Talk.}
{116}{}{说话。}
#{117}{}{How are things going, sheriff?}
{117}{}{最近怎么样，警长？}
#{118}{}{I have to tell you something important.}
{118}{}{我得告诉你一些重要的事情。}
#{119}{}{I need to get going.}
{119}{}{我得走了。}
#{120}{}{Really? And what is it?}
{120}{}{真正地？那是什么？}
#{121}{}{Nevermind, wasn't as important.}
{121}{}{没关系，没那么重要。}
#{122}{}{I was able to get a filter for the artesian tower. Can you tell me who would be the best option to sell it to?}
{122}{}{我找到了一个过滤塔。你能告诉我卖给谁是最好的选择吗？}
#{123}{}{Could you find an open position for a vagrant? No, not for me.}
{123}{}{你能为流浪汉找个空位吗？不，不适合我。}
#{124}{}{Sheriff, I need some *serious* work. Well... You get what I mean.}
{124}{}{警长，我需要一些严肃的工作。好。。。你明白我的意思。}
#{125}{}{}
{125}{}{}
#{126}{}{Sheriff, there is some nasty business about some dog...}
{126}{}{警长，有些狗的事很糟糕。。。}
#{127}{}{You know that Merck beats his wife? I can attest to it!}
{127}{}{你知道默克打了他的妻子吗？我可以证明！}
#{128}{}{Merck killed his wife! I saw it with my own eyes!}
{128}{}{默克杀了他的妻子！我亲眼看到的！}
#{130}{}{To me.}
{130}{}{对我来说。}
#{131}{}{Uh... May I ask why? I thought the Nuka-Cola factory could require one, for example.}
{131}{}{休斯敦大学。。。我可以问一下为什么吗？例如，我想努卡可乐厂可能需要一个。}
#{132}{}{That's right. But then our city will continue to have problems with healthcare and clean water. Those who would possess the possibility to generate a lot of clean water could become a real scourge for the city and provoke a lot of conflicts.}
{132}{}{这是正确的。但到那时，我们的城市将继续面临医疗保健和清洁用水方面的问题。那些有可能产生大量清洁水的人可能会成为城市的真正祸害，并引发许多冲突。}
#{133}{}{What conflicts? Between whom?}
{133}{}{什么冲突？谁之间？}
#{134}{}{For example, between the ordinary people and the factory. If the filter is in possession of the city, the factory will suffer significant income losses, which will have impact on jobs. Given that the factory is the industrial base for the city and the main local enterprise, nothing good would come of it. The worse the situation at the factory - the worse the situation of the population.}
{134}{}{例如，在普通人和工厂之间。如果过滤网被城市占有，工厂将遭受巨大的收入损失，这将对就业产生影响。鉴于这家工厂是该市的工业基地，也是当地的主要企业，它不会有什么好结果。工厂的情况越糟，人口的情况就越糟。}
#{135}{}{Then why not to give the filter to the factory?}
{135}{}{那为什么不把过滤器交给工厂呢？}
#{136}{}{Because the factory will seize the water supply, using it for business and not for the benefit of the population. Many would be outraged by that. I suggest to find a neutral side that would equalize the situation. I'm the sheriff - I'm that side. Sell the filter to me and there will be no big problems.}
{136}{}{因为工厂会抢占水源，把它用来做生意，而不是为了人民的利益。很多人会为此感到愤怒。我建议找一个中立的方面来平衡局势。我是警长-我在那边。把过滤器卖给我就不会有大问题了。}
#{137}{}{And what price would you pay?}
{137}{}{你会付出什么代价？}
#{138}{}{Ten thousands. I can't take more out of the treasury, since we're not a rich city. The factory would certainly offer bigger amount, but I have already said how it would end. Think about it.}
{138}{}{一万块。我不能从财政部多拿点钱，因为我们不是一个富裕的城市。工厂肯定会提供更大的数量，但我已经说过它将如何结束。好好想想。}
#{139}{}{Deal.}
{139}{}{处理。}
#{140}{}{I'll think about it and make a decision later.}
{140}{}{我会考虑一下，以后再做决定。}
#{141}{}{Well, it's up to you. But you'd better consider my words.}
{141}{}{好吧，这取决于你。但你最好考虑一下我的话。}
#{142}{}{Okay.}
{142}{}{可以。}
#{143}{}{Well, you made a wise decision. Here is your money. And... Thank you. Your assistance to our city will not be forgotten.}
{143}{}{你做了个明智的决定。这是你的钱。还有。。。非常感谢。你对我们城市的帮助不会被忘记。}
#{144}{}{No problem, Sheriff!}
{144}{}{没问题，警长！}
#{145}{}{You delivered a filter for the artesian tower and this significantly improved the local living conditions.}
{145}{}{你为自流塔提供了一个过滤器，这大大改善了当地的生活条件。}
#{146}{}{I want to report a crime! The merchant in the parking lot sold me irradiated Nuka-Cola.}
{146}{}{我要报案！停车场的商人卖给我辐照过的努卡可乐。}
#{147}{}{Damn, I could smell that something was fishy about that asshole! It never occurred to me to check his goods for radiation exposure. He probably has serious mental issues, carrying irradiated things around. Well, we have to confiscate and destroy the goods... [Calls for his sergeant and tells him to settle the matter before turning his attention back to you] Thank you for your testimony. This was a timely decision, someone could get hurt.}
{147}{}{妈的，我闻到那混蛋有点可疑！我从没想过要检查他的货物是否受到辐射。他可能有严重的精神问题，随身带着受辐射的东西。嗯，我们必须没收并销毁这些货物。。。[打电话给他的中士，告诉他在把注意力转向你之前解决问题]谢谢你的证词。这是个及时的决定，有人会受伤的。}
#{148}{}{You're welcome, Sheriff.}
{148}{}{不客气，警长。}
#{150}{}{For a vagrant, huh? Is this about the one that wanders around the sales area in the center? Was about time for him to get himself from the gutter... Very well, I can think of some job for him. Not for the soft-handed though, but it will be hard and honest work. Tell him to come to me and we'll talk about it.}
{150}{}{为了一个流浪汉？这是关于那个在中心销售区徘徊的人吗？是时候让他从阴沟里出来了。。。很好，我可以给他找份工作。虽然不适合手软的人，但这将是一项艰苦而诚实的工作。告诉他来找我，我们再谈。}
#{151}{}{Will do.}
{151}{}{就行了。}
#{152}{}{There is actually something I'm not capable of doing myself, but I am not sure you would be capable either.}
{152}{}{实际上有些事我自己做不了，但我不确定你也能做。}
#{153}{}{}
{153}{}{}
#{154}{}{There is actually something I'm not capable of doing myself.}
{154}{}{实际上有些事我自己做不了。}
#{155}{}{Tell me, it sounds interesting...}
{155}{}{告诉我，听起来很有趣。。。}
#{156}{}{First a bit of history, so you know what kind of a hole you are going to stick your nose in. Once there was a civil war in Salt Lake, and the criminal underworld thrived in it. It was a difficult time for the city. Then I decided not to stand it any longer and deal with the bastards.}
{156}{}{首先是一段历史，这样你就知道你要把鼻子塞进什么样的洞里了。盐湖城曾经发生过一场内战，黑社会也在战争中兴盛起来。对这个城市来说，那是一段艰难的时期。然后我决定不再忍受下去，和那些混蛋打交道。}
#{157}{}{And?}
{157}{}{然后呢？}
#{158}{}{I knew the approximate number of the perps. So, I took a troop of determined boys with me and we raided all their hot spots. The captives cracked out and gave away their accomplices. As it turned out, sometimes it is useful to cross the line.}
{158}{}{我知道罪犯的大概数目。所以，我带了一大群意志坚定的男孩，袭击了他们所有的热点。俘虏们大发雷霆，把同伙出卖了。事实证明，有时越界是有用的。}
#{159}{}{And?}
{159}{}{然后呢？}
#{160}{}{We gathered the full gang and put them on public display in the square. The city learned the lesson well. Most scumbags hung on the gallows for three days. Those who were involved with some illegal business but did not deserve to die were cast away from the city. We haven't heard from them in a long time... Until recently.}
{160}{}{我们把一伙人召集起来，在广场上公开展出。这个城市很好地吸取了教训。大多数人渣在绞刑架上被绞死了三天。那些从事非法生意但不配死去的人被赶出了城市。我们好久没有他们的消息了。。。直到最近。}
#{161}{}{So what did they do now?}
{161}{}{他们现在做了什么？}
#{162}{}{We managed to nearly forget that they exist, not counting some occasional deaths on the road southwards. But over the last couple years we began to hear more and more about Provo - especially about attacks on caravans and travelers. Sometimes these attacks make no sense whatsoever. I think they are trying to take revenge on us.}
{162}{}{我们差点忘了它们的存在，还不算往南路上偶尔有人死亡。但是在过去的几年里，我们开始听到越来越多关于普罗沃的消息，特别是关于对商队和旅行者的袭击。有时这些攻击毫无意义。我想他们是想报复我们。}
#{163}{}{So they don't come to the city?}
{163}{}{所以他们不来城里？}
#{164}{}{They are simply too afraid to come here. But, apparently, they got bored with farming either. The gang occasionally carries out small raids and robberies in the outskirts of the city. But there is the guy who holds the whole gang together.}
{164}{}{他们简直不敢来这里。但是，显然，他们也厌倦了耕作。该团伙偶尔在城郊进行小型突袭和抢劫。但是有一个人把整个团伙团结在一起。}
#{165}{}{Who is he?}
{165}{}{他是谁？}
#{166}{}{Gary Gilmore. The "records" of the offender are so diverse it makes you wonder. For me it is obvious that he is clearly not right in the head. He deserves to die like no other, but - and this is important to me - our city folks must witness his death.}
{166}{}{加里・吉尔摩。罪犯的“记录”如此多样化，让你感到疑惑。对我来说，很明显他脑子里的想法是不对的。他应该像其他人一样死去，但是――这对我来说很重要――我们的城市居民必须见证他的死亡。}
#{167}{}{And what keeps you?}
{167}{}{是什么让你不开心？}
#{168}{}{A dozen thugs in the unfamiliar ruins of Provo, which is also spiked with traps throughout. We would lose a lot of men trying to assault them in there. It is much easier to slip in alone. But I need my people here, so I've been looking for a mercenary for a while, bold and experienced enough to, if not get Gilmore alive, then at least to bring him down.}
{168}{}{十几个暴徒在不熟悉的普罗沃废墟里，那里到处都是陷阱。我们会失去很多人去攻击他们。一个人溜进去容易多了。但我需要我的人在这里，所以我一直在寻找一个雇佣军有一段时间，有足够的勇气和经验，如果不能让吉尔摩活着，那么至少把他打倒。}
#{169}{}{A serious job. Is there a serious payment involved?}
{169}{}{严肃的工作。是否涉及严重的付款？}
#{170}{}{For our city, a bounty of 3,000 per head is pretty serious. For the living criminal I'll pay twice as much. I advise you to take the time and think carefully about everything. First evaluate the situation, then make a decision.}
{170}{}{对我们城市来说，每人3000英镑的悬赏是相当严重的。对于活着的罪犯，我要付双倍的钱。我建议你花点时间仔细考虑每件事。先评估形势，再做决定。}
#{171}{}{Agreed, I will do this job.}
{171}{}{同意，我会做这个工作。}
#{172}{}{I have to think about the offer.}
{172}{}{我得考虑一下这个提议。}
#{173}{}{Enough of this. I'm not a mercenary actually... [leave]}
{173}{}{够了。其实我不是雇佣兵。。。[离开]}
#{177}{}{Gilmore refuses to go back to Salt Lake. Maybe it's better if I just shoot him?}
{177}{}{吉尔摩拒绝回盐湖城。也许我开枪打他更好？}
#{178}{}{I'll be glad of any opportunity to show the city some form of justice, but public hanging is preferable.}
{178}{}{我很高兴有机会向这个城市展示某种形式的正义，但最好是公开绞刑。}
#{179}{}{Well, you certainly know this better.}
{179}{}{好吧，你当然更清楚这一点。}
#{180}{}{Gilmore is dead. It was the only thing that could be done.}
{180}{}{吉尔摩死了。这是唯一能做的事。}
#{181}{}{You think, I will rejoice just by receiving such messages? I need proof, strong and unambiguous. Can you present some?}
{181}{}{你以为，只要收到这样的信息，我就会高兴吗？我需要有力的证据。你能介绍一些吗？}
#{182}{}{Here's his head. You're not going to deny that it's *his* body part, right?}
{182}{}{这是他的头。你不会否认那是他身体的一部分吧？}
#{183}{}{Unfortunately, no.}
{183}{}{不幸的是，没有。}
#{184}{}{Evidently. Rest assured, the city will not just take your word for it. People will whisper, make up stories... And now - get out from the office and come back only with some evidence!}
{184}{}{很明显。放心，这个城市不会相信你的话。人们会窃窃私语，编故事。。。现在-离开办公室，带着一些证据回来！}
#{185}{}{[Go]}
{185}{}{[开始]}
#{186}{}{Excellent work! Look - so frail-looking and how much trouble he made... We will place this head on the main square, where the whole city would see and admire the inevitability of retribution. Well, as promised, here's 3000 for the job done. Thank you, we will not forget it.}
{186}{}{干得好！你看，他看起来很虚弱，惹了很多麻烦。。。我们将把这个头像放在主广场上，在那里，整个城市都会看到并钦佩报应的必然性。好吧，正如我所承诺的，这是完成任务的3000英镑。谢谢，我们不会忘记的。}
#{187}{}{You're welcome.}
{187}{}{不客气。}
#{188}{}{So, what about Gilmore? When is the trial?}
{188}{}{那么，吉尔摩呢？什么时候开庭？}
#{189}{}{The bastard will get what he deserved, but not immediately. We still have to question him on many issues. Afterwards we'll drag him through the streets for everybody to see. And then he'll finally get what people like him should get.}
{189}{}{这混蛋会得到他应得的，但不会马上得到。我们还有很多问题要问他。之后我们会把他拖到街上让大家看。他最终会得到像他这样的人应该得到的。}
#{190}{}{I see.}
{190}{}{我懂了。}
#{191}{}{Gary Gilmore and his life of crime is over.}
{191}{}{加里・吉尔摩和他的犯罪生涯结束了。}
#{192}{}{Excellent work! Many would envy to such grip. Well then, you are not only did a great job, but also saved life of many potential victims of that maniac. Because of this I'll gladly double the bounty. Here. [hands you $6000]}
{192}{}{干得好！许多人都会羡慕这种控制。好吧，那么，你不仅做了一个伟大的工作，而且还挽救了许多潜在的受害者的生命，那个疯子。因此，我很乐意加倍赏金。在这里。[递给你6000美元]}
#{193}{}{Glad to help, Sheriff.}
{193}{}{很乐意帮忙，警长。}
#{197}{}{Sheriff, since we dealt with the maniac, do you maybe have another job for me?}
{197}{}{警长，既然我们和那个疯子打过交道，你还有别的工作给我吗？}
#{198}{}{So you think you are tough? Or you just like to take someone else's life for hard cash? Okay, it's not my business. I am willing to pay a bounty for every head of the rest of the Provo gang. And do not even think to deceive me - we keep a dossier on each of them, with photos and detailed descriptions.}
{198}{}{所以你觉得你很坚强？或者你只是想用别人的生命来换取现金？好吧，这不关我的事。我愿意为普罗沃帮派的每一个头目付一笔赏金。别想欺骗我，我们每个人都有档案，有照片和详细的描述。}
#{199}{}{Clear. Well, I'll think about your offer. See you later.}
{199}{}{清除。好吧，我会考虑你的提议。再见。}

#{200}{}{As we do not have enough dog problems here... I'm listening.}
{200}{}{因为我们这里没有足够的狗问题。。。我在听。}
#{201}{}{The boy who lives across from here lost his dog and asked me to find her, but the dog died...}
{201}{}{住在对面的那个男孩丢了他的狗，让我去找她，但是狗死了。。。}
#{202}{}{Let me guess - from your hands, right?}
{202}{}{让我猜猜-从你的手上，对吗？}
#{203}{}{Yes, but I had to do it! She had obviously caught rabies and attacked me.}
{203}{}{是的，但我必须这么做！她显然得了狂犬病，袭击了我。}
#{204}{}{No, the outcast who lives near the artesian tower did it.}
{204}{}{不，是住在自流塔附近的被驱逐者干的。}
#{205}{}{I understand. The city always had rabid dogs. Relax, I will talk with the boy and explain the situation to him. You just stay here and wait.}
{205}{}{我理解。这个城市总是有疯狗。别紧张，我会和那个男孩谈谈，向他解释情况。你就呆在这里等着吧。}
#{206}{}{To be honest, I am not so sure. I should go and check.}
{206}{}{老实说，我不太确定。我应该去看看。}
#{207}{}{Excellent!}
{207}{}{杰出的！}
#{208}{}{No, I'll do it. Since it's my fault, I'd better tell him myself.}
{208}{}{不，我来做。既然是我的错，我最好自己告诉他。}
#{209}{}{Are you sure? Well, it's up to you.}
{209}{}{你确定？好吧，这取决于你。}
#{210}{}{I talked to the kid and his family. Everything is fine. You can forget about that incident.}
{210}{}{我和那孩子和他的家人谈过了。一切都很好。你可以忘掉那件事。}
#{211}{}{Thank you, Sheriff!}
{211}{}{谢谢你，警长！}
#{212}{}{And why did he do it?}
{212}{}{他为什么这么做？}
#{213}{}{Because he eats them!!!}
{213}{}{因为他吃了它们！！！}
#{214}{}{I thought so. To be honest, I am even grateful. Though we all dislike the guy, he rids the city of stray dogs. However, without direct proof I can't do anything about it.}
{214}{}{我想是的。说实话，我甚至很感激。虽然我们都不喜欢这个家伙，但他在这个城市里到处都是流浪狗。但是，没有直接的证据，我什么也做不了。}
#{215}{}{I have the tag of the dog. I found it just outside of his house.}
{215}{}{我有狗的标签。我在他家外面找到的。}
#{216}{}{I have no proof.}
{216}{}{我没有证据。}
#{217}{}{I have no proof, but I witnessed it myself! Is this enough?!}
{217}{}{我没有证据，但我亲眼目睹了！够了吗？！}
#{218}{}{And what should I do about it? Punish a person on someone else's words? And what if that isn't true and the dog then returns to the owners? How would I look? "The sheriff punishes the innocent!" - I disagree with such course of events.}
{218}{}{我该怎么办？用别人的话惩罚一个人？如果那不是真的，然后狗又回到主人那里呢？我看起来怎么样？”治安官惩罚无辜的人！”-我不同意这种做法。}
#{219}{}{True, I then will look for evidence.}
{219}{}{是的，那我就去找证据。}
#{220}{}{Good enough for me. I'll talk to them. Relax.}
{220}{}{对我来说足够了。我会和他们谈谈。放松。}
#{232}{}{Look, sheriff. You're a smart man. If you need someone for some "wet work", then this is your real chance. There are  }
{232}{}{听着，警长。你是个聪明人。如果你需要一个人做一些“湿工作”，那么这是你真正的机会。有}

{233}{}{我枪上的刻痕。你不觉得我处理不了当地的小问题吗？}
#{234}{}{Well, you know better.}
{234}{}{好吧，你更清楚。}
#{235}{}{You doubt my abilities? Then I don't need your stinking job.}
{235}{}{你怀疑我的能力？那我就不需要你那讨厌的工作了。}
#{236}{}{Sheriff, I have seen a lot during my wanderings and got myself out of a lot of sticky situations. I would really like to help you.}
{236}{}{警长，我在流浪中看到了很多，我摆脱了很多棘手的情况。我真的很想帮你。}
#{237}{}{Hmm? You look pretty sharp, I don't know about the rest. Well, you decide. If you die, don't come screaming at me.}
{237}{}{隐马尔可夫模型？你看起来很犀利，其余的我都不知道。好吧，你决定吧。如果你死了，别冲我尖叫。}
#{238}{}{Hmm, if you really are an excellent shooter, you may be able to stand up for yourself...}

#{239}{}{That's great. What is this problem that needs to be solved?}
{239}{}{太好了。这个问题需要解决的是什么？}
#{240}{}{Sheriff, I do not advise to reject my proposal, if you need "wet work" done. I have }
{240}{}{警长，我不建议你拒绝我的建议，如果你需要“湿工作”做的话。我有}
#{241}{}{aliens from Area 51 on my tab, for example.}
{241}{}{例如，我账单上51区的外星人。}
#{250}{}{Sheriff, they say you know the whereabouts of the bikers base. Is that true?}
{250}{}{警长，他们说你知道摩托车基地的下落。是真的吗？}
#{251}{}{Yes, it's true. And I'm not going to share that information for nothing. First, prove your worth to this city.}
{251}{}{是的，这是真的。我不会白白的分享这些信息。首先，向这个城市证明你的价值。}
#{252}{}{I could give you some cash for the information.}
{252}{}{我可以给你一些现金来获取信息。}
#{253}{}{Don't you think I've already done enough?}
{253}{}{你不觉得我已经做得够多了吗？}
#{254}{}{I will consider your words.}
{254}{}{我会考虑你的话。}
#{255}{}{Money? Do I look like a merchant to you?  However... You can make a donation to the city. Around $3000, for instance, would help a lot around here.}
{255}{}{钱？你觉得我像个商人吗？然而。。。你可以向城市捐款。比如说，3000美元左右，对这里会有很大帮助。}
#{256}{}{Done, here is my donation.}
{256}{}{好了，这是我的捐款。}
#{257}{}{Well, now I see that you are not one of those who spit on law and order. Now, concerning your problem: here are the coordinates of Battle Mountain, where one of the biker camps is located. I haven't been there myself, so all I can do is to share this information.}
{257}{}{好吧，现在我知道你不是那种唾弃法律和秩序的人。现在，关于你的问题：这里是战山的坐标，那里有一个摩托车营地。我自己没有去过那里，所以我能做的就是分享这些信息。}
#{258}{}{Thank you.}

#{259}{}{Hmm. Let me think. Given your reputation in my city, I... }
{259}{}{嗯。让我想想。考虑到你在我城市的名声，我。。。}
#{260}{}{...am pleased to share the information with you.}
{260}{}{…很高兴与您分享信息。}
#{261}{}{...will not help you.}
{261}{}{…帮不了你。}
#{262}{}{For a long time I had such suspicions but didn't find anything conclusive, and his wife doesn't tell me anything. I guess she is too afraid. Nevertheless, I can not interfere. It is their private life.}
{262}{}{很长一段时间我都有这样的怀疑，但没有发现任何确凿的证据，他的妻子也没有告诉我任何事情。我猜她太害怕了。不过，我不能干涉。这是他们的私生活。}
#{263}{}{Really? And when it's too late?}
{263}{}{真正地？当一切都太迟了？}
#{264}{}{Well, what can I do? If the wife herself admits it and asks for help... But even in that case, I do not like to punish people for someone's words. It's a small town, there are a lot of gossip and family grievances. It is better to stay away of it, believe me. Hopefully, life will teach them to appreciate each other.}
{264}{}{我能做什么？如果妻子自己承认并寻求帮助。。。但即使这样，我也不喜欢因为别人的话而惩罚别人。这是一个小镇，有很多流言蜚语和家人的不满。相信我，最好离它远点。希望生活能教会他们互相欣赏。}
#{265}{}{Hmm. Well, if you're so sure then...}
{265}{}{嗯。好吧，如果你确定的话。。。}
#{266}{}{What?! Damn it! I suspected that it would end badly. But if I had intervened, the problem wouldn't got resolved. You can't simply change people like Merck. Now we bust his ass. Hey guys! Get ready! And you wait here until we get back.}
{266}{}{什么？！该死的！我怀疑结局会很糟。但如果我介入，问题就不会解决。你不能简单地改变默克这样的人。现在我们干掉他。嘿，伙计们！准备好！你在这里等我们回来。}
#{267}{}{[Wait]}
{267}{}{[等等]}
#{268}{}{I got the bastard! He was so hysterical that he didn't even bother to resist and asked for the gallows himself. I suppose, when he sobers up and sleep it off, he will talk differently. What do you think, what to do with him?}
{268}{}{我抓住那个混蛋了！他歇斯底里得连反抗都懒得反抗，自己要了绞刑架。我想，当他清醒过来睡一觉的时候，他会说不同的话。你觉得他怎么样？}
#{269}{}{Public hanging! An edification, so to speak.}
{269}{}{公开绞刑！可以说是一种教化。}
#{270}{}{Hang him, but not in public. Let this shameful case remain a secret, as nothing could help Merck. He is condemned.}
{270}{}{绞死他，但不要当众。让这个可耻的案子继续保密吧，因为没有什么能帮助默克。他被判有罪。}
#{271}{}{He has no longer any roots in the city, maybe it is better to exile him?}
{271}{}{他在城里已经没有根了，也许流放他更好？}
#{272}{}{Sentence him to community service under high security. He needs some discipline.}
{272}{}{在高度戒备的情况下判他去社区服务。他需要一些纪律。}
#{273}{}{I do not know, it's up to you.}
{273}{}{我不知道，这取决于你。}
#{274}{}{You're right. I'll think about the punishment.}
{274}{}{你说得对。我会考虑惩罚的。}
#{275}{}{Oh! Thank you for the money!}
{275}{}{哦！谢谢你的钱！}
#{276}{}{Yes, you're right. He lacks discipline. It is a pity that it has come down to this, because he was a promising man. His wounded pride is his doing.}
{276}{}{是的，你说得对。他缺乏纪律。遗憾的是，归根结底，他是个有前途的人。他受伤的骄傲是他的所作所为。}
#{277}{}{Well, thank you for reporting it to me. Here's 200 bucks. I hope you will continue to abide order in Salt Lake. All the best.}
{277}{}{好吧，谢谢你向我汇报。这是200美元。我希望你们继续遵守盐湖城的秩序。祝你一切顺利。}
#{278}{}{Banish him? I already went through this once with the bastards who are now settled in the Provo area. Now they won't ever step a foot in here. I hope Merck will also understand this lesson. }
{278}{}{放逐他？我已经和现在定居在普罗沃地区的混蛋们一起经历过一次了。现在他们再也不会踏进这里了。我希望默克公司也能理解这个教训。}
#{279}{}{I agree. This is his personal problem, let it go with him to the grave.}
{279}{}{我同意。这是他的个人问题，随他去吧。}
#{280}{}{We have not had a public execution in a long time... Well, it may be worth it to shake up the public a little and to remind everyone how it all began...}
{280}{}{我们已经很久没有公开处决了。。。嗯，也许值得一点震动公众，提醒大家这一切是怎么开始的。。。}
#{281}{}{Uh... Sheriff, I already took care of it. Merck is dead.}
{281}{}{休斯敦大学。。。警长，我已经处理好了。默克死了。}
#{282}{}{Oh, that's how it is! Maybe you also want the sheriff's badge?! Turn around and leave my offices. We don't need the likes of you in our city.}
{282}{}{哦，就是这样！也许你还想要警长徽章？！转身离开我的办公室。我们的城市不需要像你这样的人。}
#{283}{}{Uh...}
{283}{}{休斯敦大学。。。}
#{310}{}{Anything specific?}
{310}{}{有什么特别的吗？}
#{311}{}{Forget it, there's another question.}
{311}{}{算了，还有一个问题。}
#{312}{}{Thanks for your answer. Bye.}
{312}{}{谢谢你的回答。再见。}
#{313}{}{More or less alright I guess.}
{313}{}{我想差不多吧。}
#{350}{}{Some sneak is raiding all the Nuka-Cola vending machines around here. Everyone at the factory is in panic, and we have not a single clue who could do that.}
{350}{}{有人偷袭了附近所有的努卡可乐贩卖机。工厂里的每个人都很惊慌，我们一点也不知道谁能做到。}
#{351}{}{About Provo. The people still don't believe that everyone there is dead. News got by with caravan merchants, but no one from my folks wants to go in there and check. I hope the fucking bastards are dead after all.}
{351}{}{关于普罗沃。人们仍然不相信那里的人都死了。商队的商人们得到了消息，但我的家人没有人愿意进去查看。我希望那些混蛋都死了。}
#{352}{}{Gary Gilmore got what he deserved. May he burn in hell!}
{352}{}{加里・吉尔摩罪有应得。愿他在地狱里燃烧！}
#{353}{}{Well, the Nuka-Cola factory got an unprecedented growth. Things are getting better. Though on the other hand, the better the factory works, the worse the ecology in the city because of all the produced waste. Damn unfair situation.}
{353}{}{嗯，努卡可乐厂得到了前所未有的发展。情况正在好转。但另一方面，工厂工作得越好，城市的生态就越差，因为产生的垃圾太多了。真他妈的不公平。}
#{354}{}{It seems that the Nuka-Cola factory will soon fall apart. We ought to do something. Workers scatter in all directions, the production drops. However, the people are getting better, since lower emissions from the factory means less harmful substances thrown into the lake and the city becomes cleaner.}
{354}{}{看来努卡可乐厂很快就会分崩离析。我们应该做点什么。工人四散，产量下降。然而，人们正在变得更好，因为工厂排放的更少意味着扔进湖里的有害物质更少，城市变得更清洁。}
#{355}{}{We all noticed that the health matters in the city are getting better. We got way fewer diseases and there is no such crowds in front of toilets anymore. This makes me happy.}
{355}{}{我们都注意到这个城市的健康状况正在好转。我们的疾病少了很多，厕所前也不再有这样的人群了。这让我很高兴。}
#{356}{}{Health in the city became very bad. Real plague. I advise you to beware of direct contact with people and drink cola instead of water.}
{356}{}{这个城市的健康状况变得很差。真正的瘟疫。我建议你当心与人直接接触，喝可乐而不是水。}
#{357}{}{In general, the city is thriving. I've never seen such a flow of visitors. Apparently, in the wastelands are already spread rumors that the city got up to it's feet - and you can earn here some money and lay your head. I hope this will continue.}
{357}{}{总的来说，这座城市很繁荣。我从来没见过这么多游客。很显然，在荒地里已经有传言说这个城市已经站起来了――你可以在这里赚点钱，然后把头埋起来。我希望这会继续下去。}
#{358}{}{The whole town has gone mad. I barely hold the situation together. People can get feral any moment and tear up me, or anyone else in their path, to pieces. We must do something, but there are no good ideas. I do hope we'll figure something out...}
{358}{}{整个小镇都疯了。我几乎无法控制局面。人们随时都可能变得凶残，把我，或者其他任何人撕成碎片。我们必须做点什么，但没有好主意。我真的希望我们能想出办法。。。}
#{359}{}{The whole city lives its ordinary life. The population does not complain, everyone knows their place and somehow get along.}
{359}{}{整个城市过着平常的生活。民众不抱怨，每个人都知道自己的位置，不知何故相处融洽。}
#{360}{}{With the situation in Provo resolved, the town is calm again. Thanks to you, the citizens calmed down and are no longer afraid to go out at night.}
{360}{}{随着普罗沃局势的解决，该镇又恢复了平静。多亏了你，市民们平静下来，不再害怕晚上出门。}
#{370}{}{This is the batch of heads from Provo, as agreed.}
{370}{}{这是从普罗沃来的一批人头。}
#{371}{}{Well, let's look at them...}
{371}{}{好吧，让我们看看他们。。。}
#{372}{}{[Next]}
{372}{}{[下一步]}
#{373}{}{What? Are you trying to mock me?}
{373}{}{什么？你想嘲笑我吗？}
#{374}{}{Oh, come on! Just think about how it rolled on the floor...}
{374}{}{哦，来吧！想想它是怎么滚到地上的。。。}
#{375}{}{Another problem of the city solved. Thank you on behalf of all citizens. Here's your reward, }
{375}{}{城市的另一个问题解决了。代表全体市民感谢你们。这是你的奖赏，}
#{376}{}{ dollars.}
{376}{}{美元。}
#{377}{}{To think how much one gets for an ordinary head...}
{377}{}{想想一个普通的脑袋能赚多少钱。。。}
#{380}{}{[Catching the sight of your sheriff's badge, he raises a skeptical eyebrow] Where did you get that?}
{380}{}{[看到你的警徽，他扬起怀疑的眉毛]你从哪儿弄来的？}
#{381}{}{I am the elected sheriff of Uranium City.}
{381}{}{我是铀城的当选警长。}
#{382}{}{Well, you see, they just gave it to me. I had no desire to take it, but they insisted...}
{382}{}{嗯，你看，他们刚刚给了我。我不想拿，但他们坚持。。。}
#{383}{}{I heard something about this town from the caravaneers... They dig out uranium ore for power plants there, right? Well, it's nice to see that other settlements keep to maintain order by the law. Settle down sheriff, for you I am willing to find more time than usual.}
{383}{}{我从商队那里听说了一些关于这个城市的事。。。他们挖出铀矿石在那里建发电厂，对吗？好吧，很高兴看到其他定居点继续维持法律秩序。安定下来，警长，我愿意为你找更多的时间。}
#{384}{}{It is nice to see a friendly representative of the law. Well, let's talk, Sheriff.}
{384}{}{很高兴见到一位友好的法律代表。好吧，我们谈谈，警长。}
#{385}{}{Mm... Well then, hide this trinket in a pocket, until I took it away. *I* am the sheriff here, and nobody except *me* will carry that title within my city.}
{385}{}{嗯。。。那么，把这个小饰物藏在口袋里，直到我把它拿走。*我是这里的治安官，除了我，没有人会在我的城市里拥有这个头衔。}
#{386}{}{Uhm, sure, Sheriff.}
{386}{}{嗯，当然，警长。}
#{400}{}{Are there any working trains riding through the city lately?}
{400}{}{最近这座城市有运行的火车吗？}
#{401}{}{Ha! You here for that too? Tired of the simple life? Then you better go to the gallows in the evening. More often then not, there is someone to bid this life farewell.}
{401}{}{哈！你也是为了这个来的？厌倦了简单的生活？那你最好晚上上绞刑架。更经常的情况是，有人向今生告别。}
#{402}{}{So after all trains are coming through here, right?}
{402}{}{所以在所有的火车都经过这里之后，对吗？}
#{403}{}{Yes, there is one. Comes in the middle of the night. Rushes through at half speed without stopping, vanishes heading west. They say that sometimes you can hear the soul of the driver playing harmonica. Those who saw the "Ghost Train" silhouette are afraid to cross the tracks. What if it suddenly appears out of nowhere and chop you into small pieces?}
{403}{}{是的，有一个。半夜来的。以半速冲过去，不停地向西消失。他们说有时你能听到司机吹奏口琴的声音。那些看到“幽灵火车”轮廓的人都不敢越过铁轨。如果它突然不知从哪里冒出来，把你剁成碎片怎么办？}
#{404}{}{Are you serious?!}
{404}{}{你是认真的吗？！}
#{405}{}{Quite! Some even tried to jump onto the roof of the car, but were burned by infernal flames, turning into ashes.}
{405}{}{完全正确！有些人甚至试图跳上车顶，但被地狱般的火焰烧毁，化为灰烬。}
#{406}{}{Wow! And how often does it come through?}
{406}{}{哇！多久来一次？}
#{407}{}{Several times per season, heading back and forth. It clearly has a very long track. Must be in need to collect a lot of souls on the road.}
{407}{}{每季几次，来回穿梭。它显然有很长的轨迹。一定需要在路上收集很多灵魂。}
#{408}{}{Uh okay, skip the horror-show... Do you know his final destination?}
{408}{}{好吧，跳过恐怖节目。。。你知道他的最终目的地吗？}
#{409}{}{I don't. Some believe that it does not have stops and turns. Some even swear that he can be in different places at the same time.}
{409}{}{我没有。有些人认为它没有停车和转弯。有些人甚至发誓他可以在不同的地方在同一时间。}
#{410}{}{Hmm, I have heard from the likes of them... At the bars.}
{410}{}{嗯，我听他们这样的人说。。。在酒吧。}
#{411}{}{But it's not just all drunken nonsense. It exists. Whatever it is, it exists! Half of the city saw it.}
{411}{}{但这不仅仅是酒后胡说八道。它是存在的。不管它是什么，它都存在！半个城市的人都看到了。}
#{412}{}{Half of the city?! Well, if you think about it, maybe there is an element of truth. Anyhow, thanks for the story, but I have to go.}
{412}{}{半个城市？！好吧，如果你仔细想想，也许有一个事实的因素。不管怎样，谢谢你的报道，但我得走了。}
#{413}{}{Sheriff, skip those children's tales. We both know that the "Ghost Train" is a real one, only slightly different from usual...}
{413}{}{警长，跳过那些孩子的故事。我们都知道“幽灵列车”是真的，只是和平常有点不同。。。}
#{414}{}{Someone sometimes travels by train to the north and west. Someone had seen a robot, which is still cleaning the railway. But who needs it, and why - nobody knows.}
{414}{}{有时有人乘火车去北方和西部。有人看见一个机器人，它还在清扫铁路。但是谁需要它，为什么-没人知道。}
#{415}{}{Clearly, that means it exists for real.}
{415}{}{显然，这意味着它是真实存在的。}
#{450}{}{Halt! Not one step further!}
{450}{}{站住！别再往前走了！}
#{451}{}{Sheriff? Uh... I didn't do anything!}
{451}{}{警长？休斯敦大学。。。我什么都没做！}
#{452}{}{Look at this, the honesty itself stands in front of me. Answer, why do you go to the station?}
{452}{}{看看这个，诚实本身就站在我面前。回答，你为什么去车站？}
#{453}{}{I've got some business there, Sheriff. But it does not concern you.}
{453}{}{我有事要做，警长。但这与你无关。}
#{454}{}{And what is it?}
{454}{}{那是什么？}
#{455}{}{I'm going by train far beyond the city. }
{455}{}{我要乘火车到城外很远的地方去。}
#{456}{}{Answer me, damn you! Answer before it's too late!}
{456}{}{回答我，该死的！趁现在还来得及回答！}
#{457}{}{Get out of my way! I will not say anything!}
{457}{}{让开！我什么都不说！}
#{458}{}{Before it's too late? What are you talking about?!}
{458}{}{在太迟之前？你在说什么？！}
#{459}{}{Hell, you don't understand what you're getting into! You can't stop him, even if you put against him everyone from your lousy vault.}
{459}{}{见鬼，你不明白你在干什么！你不能阻止他，即使你把所有人都从你那糟糕的地下室推到他身上。}
#{460}{}{Have it your way. You *never* will tell *anything* to anybody. [Sheriff pulls out his gun]}
{460}{}{随你的便。你永远不会告诉任何人任何事情。[警长拔出枪]}
#{461}{}{(Oops, time to mosey along...)}
{461}{}{（哎呀，是时候混日子了……）}
#{462}{}{What are you talking about?}
{462}{}{你在说什么？}
#{463}{}{No need to act stupid, smartass. You know.}
{463}{}{别装傻了，笨蛋。你知道的。}
#{464}{}{The Reaper of Souls, right?}
{464}{}{灵魂的收割者，对吧？}
#{465}{}{We do not call his name out loud. The walls have ears.}
{465}{}{我们不大声叫他的名字。隔墙有耳。}
#{466}{}{But who is he, dammit?!}
{466}{}{但他是谁，该死的？！}
#{467}{}{Listen up, stubborn. He asked me to stop you, but I don't want to interfere in other people's problems. This is my last warning - go back to your city and forget about all of it. The Reaper will not return.}
{467}{}{听着，顽固的。他让我阻止你，但我不想干涉别人的问题。这是我最后的警告-回到你的城市，忘掉一切。收割者不会回来了。}
#{468}{}{Heh, I knew it, sheriff. You're just his houseboy!}
{468}{}{嘿，我就知道，警长。你只是他的管家！}
#{469}{}{How do you know this?}
{469}{}{你怎么知道的？}
#{470}{}{The Reaper seeks out pure souls since a long time ago. I do not know why.}
{470}{}{收割者从很久以前就开始寻找纯洁的灵魂。我不知道为什么。}
#{471}{}{Uh ... "pure souls"? Looks more like a horror story for kids.}
{471}{}{呃……”“纯洁的灵魂”？看起来更像是孩子们的恐怖故事。}
#{472}{}{Ha-ha-ha! The Sheriff believes in scary stories! That's hilarious!}
{472}{}{哈哈哈！警长相信恐怖故事！太好笑了！}
#{473}{}{"Pure Souls"? You mean humans that where not subjected to mutations, am I right?}
{473}{}{“纯洁的灵魂”？你是说人类在哪里不受基因突变的影响，对吗？}
#{474}{}{He needs the descendants of those who survived the Great War in safe vaults, which preserved their purity. Our city has nothing he desires.}
{474}{}{他需要那些在大战中幸存下来的人的后代在安全的地窖里，这样才能保持他们的纯洁。我们的城市没有他想要的东西。}
#{475}{}{What happened in your town?}
{475}{}{你镇上发生了什么事？}
#{476}{}{Why would he need genetically pure bodies?}
{476}{}{为什么他需要基因纯净的身体？}
#{477}{}{Why did he abduct people?}
{477}{}{他为什么绑架人？}
#{478}{}{During the War the people of Salt Lake survived thanks to family shelters. People came out of them gradually, over decades. So, over time, people here have lost their purity.}
{478}{}{战争期间，盐湖城的人们幸免于家庭避难所。几十年来，人们逐渐走出了他们。所以，随着时间的推移，这里的人们已经失去了纯洁。}
#{479}{}{Hmm. Apparently, the local ecology in combination with radiation and mutations affected genetics of population.}
{479}{}{嗯。显然，当地的生态环境加上辐射和突变影响了种群的遗传。}
#{480}{}{Well, of course. You've got quite a cesspool here. What else should one expect?}
{480}{}{好吧，当然。你这儿的污水坑真大。人们还能指望什么呢？}
#{481}{}{Yea, this city is not really considered clean...}
{481}{}{是的，这个城市并不是很干净。。。}
#{482}{}{I do not know what he does with the abducted, but they do not come back.}
{482}{}{我不知道他对被绑架的人做了什么，但他们没有回来。}
#{483}{}{Why not finish off this viper once and for all?}
{483}{}{为什么不彻底干掉这条毒蛇？}
#{484}{}{We have to reckon with his power. He is not just a human, he's a miracle of genetic mutations combined with bionics. He is even capable to read your mind.}
{484}{}{我们必须考虑到他的力量。他不仅仅是一个人类，他是基因突变与仿生学结合的奇迹。他甚至能读懂你的心思。}
#{485}{}{Are you seriously saying there is no way to stop him?}
{485}{}{你是说没办法阻止他？}
#{486}{}{Not in your case. So I warn you for the last time: turn around and go away. The survival of this city is more important to me than your stupid mission.}
{486}{}{对你来说不是。所以我最后一次警告你：转身走开。这座城市的生存对我来说比你愚蠢的使命更重要。}
#{487}{}{Like hell! I will go to the station, whether you want it or not.}
{487}{}{见鬼去吧！不管你愿不愿意，我都要去车站。}
#{488}{}{Okay, I'm going back to the city... For now...}
{488}{}{好吧，我要回城里。。。现在。。。}
#{489}{}{You're wrong. The Reaper of Souls will continue to rampage throughout the wastes. You don't even know his goals. What will happen if he finds "pure soul"?}
{489}{}{你错了。灵魂的收割者将继续横冲直撞。你甚至不知道他的目标。如果他找到“纯洁的灵魂”会怎样？}
#{490}{}{I'm sorry, but I *have* to stop you. [The Sheriff pulls out his gun]}
{490}{}{对不起，我必须阻止你。[警长拔出枪]}
#{491}{}{(Oops, time to mosey along...)}
{491}{}{（哎呀，是时候混日子了……）}
#{492}{}{I don't know, and don't even want to. Now turn around and don't come back.}
{492}{}{我不知道，甚至不想。现在转身别回来。}
#{493}{}{Hold on, Sheriff! Maybe he's trying to create an army of soldiers to seize the whole wasteland? Your city has already suffered enough, it's time to end this!}
{493}{}{等等，警长！也许他想建立一支军队来占领整个荒地？你的城市已经受够了，是时候结束这一切了！}
#{494}{}{Don't fool yourself! What could *you* do against him?! What?!}
{494}{}{别自欺欺人！你能对他做什么？！什么？！}
#{495}{}{I'm not so easily intimidated, I've already met him. Believe me, he has to have a weakness and I'm going to find it.}
{495}{}{我不容易被吓倒，我已经见过他了。相信我，他一定有弱点，我会找到的。}
#{496}{}{You are so naive it dazzles me. Even I had to make a deal with him, in order to save Salt Lake, I had no choice whatsoever. Everyone has to pay the price sooner or later in their life. You'll understand that in a while.}
{496}{}{你太天真了，让我眼花缭乱。即使我不得不和他做一笔交易，为了拯救盐湖城，我也别无选择。每个人迟早都要为此付出代价。你一会儿就会明白的。}
#{497}{}{This is a difficult confession to make. But the city is getting up on its feet, and the Reaper of Souls will continue to leech it until it's dry.}
{497}{}{这是一个很难坦白的事实。但是这座城市正在站起来，灵魂的收割者将继续榨取它，直到它干涸。}
#{498}{}{And how are you going to catch up to him? He moves on a black bullet-train. You can not even trace the path he takes.}
{498}{}{你要怎么赶上他？他乘坐黑色子弹头列车。你连他走的路都找不到。}
#{499}{}{I have the coordinates of the vault he stationed in. He has the Overseer from my city taken, who has a tracking device on. I can pinpoint the train's whereabouts. Besides, I already have working transport and good weapons. The surprise element is on my side, along with my wits and courage. I am fully prepared for it, sheriff!}
{499}{}{我有他驻扎的保险库的坐标。他把我市的监工带走了，他身上有追踪装置。我能确定火车的位置。另外，我已经有了工作的交通工具和好的武器。惊喜因素就在我这边，还有我的智慧和勇气。我已经准备好了，警长！}
#{500}{}{I see you are serious... I'm afraid this decision will haunt me for the rest of my life. Go.}
{500}{}{我看你是认真的。。。恐怕这个决定会困扰我一辈子。去吧。}
#{501}{}{I will not let you down, Sheriff!}
{501}{}{我不会让你失望的，警长！}
#{502}{}{...And I will not let my city to be put in danger by trusting a wimp like you. Don't make me laugh and get out, for all of our sakes!}
{502}{}{……我不会因为信任你这样的懦夫而让我的城市陷入危险。看在我们的份上，别逗我笑然后出去！}
#{503}{}{The path is clear!}
{503}{}{道路畅通！}
#{504}{}{I won't warn you twice.}
{504}{}{我不会警告你两次。}
#{505}{}{The Reaper of Souls is dead!}
{505}{}{灵魂的收割者死了！}
#{506}{}{Dead? I can't believe it... I guess we'll see that in the meantime.}
{506}{}{死了？真不敢相信。。。我想我们会看到的。}
#{507}{}{So what was the deal you concluded with him?}
{507}{}{你和他达成了什么协议？}
#{508}{}{Once the city had very unstable social conditions. Criminal vermin flooded the city, even during the day no one felt safe. It was practically a civil war. Then he came, offered help in bringing order. It wasn't an easy decision for me to make.}
{508}{}{曾经这个城市的社会状况非常不稳定。犯罪的害虫充斥着城市，即使在白天也没有人感到安全。那实际上是一场内战。然后他来了，提供帮助来维持秩序。对我来说这不是一个容易的决定。}
#{509}{}{What did he demand in return?}
{509}{}{他要求什么作为回报？}
#{510}{}{Pure souls. As much as he wanted. At first he demanded them twice a year, then more and more often.}
{510}{}{纯洁的灵魂。他想要多少就多少。起初他一年要两次，后来越来越频繁。}
#{511}{}{And you did not try to resist?}
{511}{}{你没有反抗吗？}
#{512}{}{My men have always been in fear of the Reaper of Souls. They could not resist him.}
{512}{}{我的人总是害怕灵魂的收割者。他们无法抗拒他。}
#{513}{}{That decision was so immoral that I will execute judgment upon you by myself. RIGHT NOW!}
{513}{}{那个决定太不道德了，我要亲自对你进行审判。马上！}
#{514}{}{Don't blame yourself. Such decision was better than long and bloody struggle with the criminal underworld.}
{514}{}{别自责。这样的决定总比与黑社会长期血腥斗争要好。}
#{515}{}{You're right, one must pay for everything in the end, the simple truth of life.}
{515}{}{你说得对，一个人最终必须为一切付出代价，简单的生活真相。}
#{1112}{}{Okay. Take this one to the cell, and this one we will release... [Turns to you] This is my first and last warning, only because you're the new person in town. I don't know what pushed you onto a dirty business, but we won't forgive you in the future. I'm sure you understand me. [stroking his gun] Now get out.}
{1112}{}{可以。把这个带到牢房，我们会释放这个。。。[转向你]这是我第一次也是最后一次警告，只是因为你是城里的新人。我不知道是什么把你推上了肮脏的事业，但我们以后不会原谅你的。我相信你理解我。现在出去。}
#{1128}{}{Merck killed his wife! I saw it with my own eyes!}
{1128}{}{默克杀了他的妻子！我亲眼看到的！}
#{1173}{}{Enough of this. I'm not a mercenary actually ... [leave]}
{1173}{}{够了。其实我不是雇佣兵。。。[离开]}
#{1184}{}{Evidently. Rest assured, the city will not just take your word for it. People will whisper, make up stories... And now - get from the office and come back only with some evidence!}
{1184}{}{很明显。放心，这个城市不会相信你的话。人们会窃窃私语，编故事。。。现在-离开办公室，带着一些证据回来！}
#{1193}{}{Glad to help, Sheriff.}
{1193}{}{很乐意帮忙，警长。}
#{1198}{}{So you think you are tough? Or you just like to take someone else's life for hard cash? Okay, it's not my business. I am willing to pay a bounty for every head of the rest of the Provo gang. And do not even think to deceive me - we keep a dossier on each of them, with photos and detailed descriptions.}
