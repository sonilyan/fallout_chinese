 Help. *Cough*. Oh shit, I'm all messed up...}
{101}{}{What happened here?}
#
{102}{}{Those fucking deathclaws... *cough*... they heard us while we were going into the cave... made an ambush.
 *cough*... the whole damn place is full of them... our guns were too weak. I tried... *cough*... couldn't run for it, the
 bastard was too fast... [He's still alive but his breathing becomes shallow. He struggles to speak.]}
{103}{}{Wait, stay with me Jerry! What can I do?}
#
{104}{}{You... *cough* must stop them... uh, take my backpack... one explosive charge should be enough... place it

{111}{}{What are you waiting for?}
{112}{}{We don't have much time.}
{113}{}{We must go now.}

{114}{}{We did it... Jerry. [Sigh.]}
