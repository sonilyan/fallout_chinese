#{200}{}{You see a man with deep scars on his neck and lower jaw. He doesn't look too friendly.}
{200}{}{你看到一个脖子和下巴上有深深伤疤的男人。他看起来不太友好。}
#{250}{}{You see Adviser Aran, observing what goes on in the palace with a strict gaze.}
{250}{}{你看到了阿朗顾问，他正用严厉的目光注视着宫殿里发生的事情。}
#{251}{}{You see emperor Aran. Resolve and determination radiate from his face.}
{251}{}{你看到阿朗皇帝。他的脸上流露出坚毅的表情。}
#{300}{}{The emperor believes your story. Therefore, I believe it as well. But know that I will be watching you carefully.}

#{400}{}{Your insolence will not go unpunished. I will see to that personally.}
{400}{}{我会亲自处理你的蛮横无礼，你会接受惩罚的。}

{450}{}{快进去。我们不能给他们反应时间。}
#{500}{}{[The man's scarred face contorts into a malicious grimace.] You have no business being here. The palace area is meant only for imperial dwellers. You foreigners are to quickly finish your business here and leave the City. I'd advise you to do just that - for your own good.}

{501}{}{我知道这里不特别欢迎来访者，你到底是谁？}
#{502}{}{I won't stay here long. I just want to know how you came by the scars.}
{502}{}{我不会在这里呆太久的。我只是想知道你的伤疤是怎么来的。}
#{503}{}{And I'd advise you to stop provoking me - for your own good.}
{503}{}{为了你自己好，我建议你不要再激怒我了。}
#{504}{}{Understood. I was just leaving.}
{504}{}{理解。我正要离开。}

{506}{}{[离开。]}

{553}{}{阿朗，我想问你一件事，伊莉莎派我去找失踪的士兵。你知道他们有可能发生什么事了吗？}
#{554}{}{Just one more thing. How did you come by the scars on your face?}
{554}{}{还有一件事，你脸上的伤疤是怎么来的？}
#{555}{}{Oh. In that case, goodbye.}

{601}{}{你不太善于沟通，是吗？你到底是谁？}
#{602}{}{Nobody tells me what to do, pal. Now I'm gonna kick your arrogant ass!}
{602}{}{不用任何人告诉我该怎么做，伙计。现在我要踢你那傲慢的屁股！}
#{603}{}{As you wish. Goodbye.}

#{702}{}{[Shake head.] Gooo!}
{702}{}{[摇摇头。]好！}
#{750}{}{Don't play games with me, stranger. The empire is devoting a lot of attention to finding that vile traitor.

#{1050}{}{If you are telling the truth, then we were both sent after Anonym. But that makes no sense... [Suddenly he pales, as if he realized something terrible.] Unless Elisa herself was the one behind the conspiracy.

#{1150}{}{You lack the training and discipline of an imperial soldier, but in this situation I do not have much choice. I will be grateful for your service.

{1151}{}{我就在你后面。}
#{1200}{}{[Aran waits until the group gathers and gets their attention with a decisive gesture.] Before us lies the main palace hall, with Elisa and her closest followers inside. They have both numerical and tactical superiority - a direct attack would spell our doom. That is why I shall try to negotiate with her while you get into positions and prepare to attack. Expect a fight against the elite of the imperial army that is supported by a unit of robots as well. It will be a tough battle. Will you prevail regardless? [The soldiers meet his question with a silent, but decisive assent. Aran turns to you.] And you? Are you with us?}

{1201}{}{毫无疑问，我不会错过这样的机会。}

{1252}{}{耶呃？}
#{1300}{}{[He thinks for a while.] Every moment of delay worsens our situation, but shutting down the robots could decide the battle. Very well.

{1300}{}{[他想了一会儿。]每一刻的拖延都会使我们的情况恶化，但关闭机器人可能会决定战局。很好，控制台位于主大厅的左下角。但是，你需要非常小心-不要让伊莉莎的人看到你。这非常重要。}

#{1453}{}{Uh.}
{1453}{}{呃。}
#{1454}{}{Our battle is over. Regrettably, emperor Myzrael did not survive - he suffered a heart attack. The traitor is responsible for his death; he simply could not take that she was Anonym.

#{1600}{}{Certainly. What do you wish to ask?}
{1600}{}{当然，你想问什么？}
#{1601}{}{I was curious how the imperial dwellers took Myzrael's death.}
{1601}{}{我很好奇帝国居民是如何看待米泽列的死。}
#{1602}{}{Tell me what future you plan for the empire.}
{1602}{}{告诉我你对帝国未来有什么打算。}
#{1603}{}{I'd like to know how you came by the scars on your face.}

{1605}{}{你打算怎么处理避难所？}
#{1606}{}{Nothing actually. Farewell, emperor Aran.}
{1606}{}{实际上什么都没有。再见，阿朗皇帝陛下。}
#{1650}{}{They took the emperor's murder hard, but at least the vile deed finally opened their eyes. They have been too sheltered from the dangers of the real world these last few years. Now they know they cannot escape them - not even here. We were all taught a very costly lesson.}
{1650}{}{他们对皇帝的谋杀很难接受，但至少这一恶行终于让他们睁开了眼睛。在过去几年里，他们太过躲避现实世界的危险。现在他们知道他们逃不掉了――即使在这里也逃不掉。我们都上了一堂代价高昂的课。}
#{1651}{}{Understood. Now, could you tell me what future you plan for the empire?}
{1651}{}{理解。现在，你能告诉我你对帝国未来有什么打算吗？}
#{1652}{}{I see. I'd also like to know how you came by the scars on your face.}
{1652}{}{我懂了。我同样想知道你脸上的伤疤是怎么来的。}
#{1653}{}{I see. I'd also like to know how you came by the scars on your face.}
{1653}{}{我懂了。我同样想知道你脸上的伤疤是怎么来的。}
#{1654}{}{Of course. What are you going to do with the Vault?}
{1654}{}{当然。你打算怎么处理避难所？}
#{1655}{}{That's all. Farewell, emperor Aran.}
{1655}{}{这就是全部。再见，阿朗皇帝。}
#{1700}{}{I must return the Imperial City to its former purpose. Restoration of the old world civilization must continue. Long ago, Emperor Myzrael wisely decided to isolate us from our enemies, but that cannot go on forever. Soon, we will have to face them directly. And I shall make sure that the empire is prepared.}
{1700}{}{我必须让这座都城恢复到原来的样子，必须继续恢复旧世界文明。很久以前，米泽列皇帝明智地决定将我们与敌人隔离，但这不可能永远持续下去。很快我们将不得不直面他们，我要确保帝国做好准备。}

{1701}{}{知道了。我很好奇帝国居民是如何看待米泽列的死。}
#{1702}{}{I hope you can. Now, could you tell me how you came by the scars on your face?}

#{1704}{}{I don't need to know anything else. Farewell.}
{1704}{}{我不需要知道任何其它事情，再见。}
#{1750}{}{It happened during the first big ghoul attack on the empire. [The unpleasant memory clouds Aran's voice.] I was in command of an advance unit then, camping south of the city. The ghouls threw a mass of heavily armed soldiers against us. We managed to repel the first wave, but the enemy soon managed to cut us off from the main army. We were surrounded, without any hope of survival. That is why I decided on an extreme solution.}
{1750}{}{这发生在第一次大型僵尸袭击帝国期间。[不愉快的记忆模糊了阿朗的声音。]当时我指挥着一支先遣部队，在城南部露营。僵尸向我们投掷了大量全副武装的士兵。我们设法击退了第一波，但敌人很快就把我们与主力军隔开了。我们被包围了，没有任何生存的希望，这就是我决定采用极端解决方案的原因。}
#{1751}{}{What did you do?}
{1751}{}{你做了什么？}
#{1800}{}{I gave an order to place explosives around our position, and to lure as many ghouls as possible to them. None of my soldiers protested. They knew they were not coming back alive, and wanted to die like heroes. They executed my order flawlessly. When I could not even see through the hordes of ghouls, I detonated the fuse. The explosion that followed destroyed everything close by. Hundreds of ghouls blown to pieces, and my men with them. I have no idea how I survived. All I know is that the search party found me a few days later, unconscious and with heavy shrapnel cuts, dozens of meters away.}
{1800}{}{我下令在我们阵地周围放置炸药，并尽可能多地引诱僵尸。我的士兵都没有抗议，他们完美地执行了我的命令，他们知道自己不会活着回来，想像英雄一样死去。当我甚至无法看穿成群的僵尸时，我点燃了导火索，随后的爆炸摧毁了附近的一切，数百名僵尸被炸成了碎片，当时我的人也和他们在一起。我不知道我是怎么活下来的，我只知道几天后搜救队在数十米外发现了我，当时我已失去知觉，身上有大量弹片。}
#{1801}{}{Touching story. But I don't understand why you kept the scars from that wound. Surely the imperial medical equipment is advanced enough to remove them.}
{1801}{}{这是一个感人的故事。但我不明白你为什么留着伤口上的伤疤。毫无疑问，帝国的医疗设备已经足够先进，可以移除它们。}
#{1802}{}{I see. I'd also like to know how the imperial subjects took Myzrael's death.}
{1802}{}{我懂了。我还想知道帝国臣民是如何看待米泽列的死。}
#{1803}{}{Life can be strange sometimes. What future do you plan for the empire anyway?}
{1803}{}{生活有时会很奇怪。你对帝国的未来有什么打算？}
#{1804}{}{Curious. Now, please, tell me what are you going to do with the Vault?}
{1804}{}{好奇。现在，请告诉我你打算怎么处理避难所？}
#{1805}{}{I have no other questions. Take care, emperor Aran.}
{1805}{}{我没有其它问题了。保重，阿朗皇帝陛下。}
#{1850}{}{You talk like our doctors. [He scowls.] Many good soldiers died on that terrible day, and the empire itself survived only barely. The scars are to remind me how high was the cost of our victory. They are a part of who I am. There shall never be a day I would wish to lose them.}
{1850}{}{你说话像我们的医生。[他他皱着眉头。]在那可怕的一天，许多优秀的士兵牺牲了，而帝国本身只是勉强幸存下来。这些伤疤让我想起我们胜利的代价有多高，它们是我的一部分，我永远不会希望失去它们。}
#{1851}{}{I understand. Now I'd like to know how the imperial subjects took Myzrael's death.}
{1851}{}{我理解。现在我想知道帝国臣民是如何看待米泽列的死。}
#{1852}{}{As you say. Next, tell me what future you plan for the empire.}
{1852}{}{就像你说的。接下来，告诉我你对帝国的未来有什么打算。}
#{1853}{}{Certainly. Would you please tell me what are you going to do with the Vault?}
{1853}{}{当然。你能告诉我你打算怎么处理这个避难所吗？}
#{1854}{}{I have to go now. Farewell, emperor Aran.}
{1854}{}{我得走了。再见，阿朗皇帝陛下。}
#{1900}{}{I am glad to see you again. What brings you to the Imperial City?}
{1900}{}{很高兴再次见到你。什么风把你吹到帝都来了？}
#{1901}{}{Just curiosity. Could you answer a few questions for me?}
{1901}{}{只是好奇而已。你能回答我几个问题吗？}
#{1902}{}{Nothing, actually. See you later, emperor Aran.}
{1902}{}{其实没什么。再见，阿朗皇帝陛下。}
#{1903}{}{Uh.}
{1903}{}{呃。}
#{1950}{}{The adviser should have selected the person for this job more carefully. Your question makes no sense. If I knew what happened to my soldiers we would not need you at all. You should head to the Dead Quarter instead of asking stupid questions. You will not find the answer anywhere else.}

#{2000}{}{You're here. I was afraid my message failed to reach you. You've probably overheard what terrible catastrophe threatens the empire.
