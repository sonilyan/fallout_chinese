#{100}{}{You see a redneck.}
{100}{}{你看到一个红脖子。}
#{101}{}{You see a rough and chatty redneck. About these usually said "shuts up any blabbers".}
{101}{}{你看到一个粗犷而健谈的乡巴佬。关于这些，人们通常说“闭嘴”。}
#{102}{}{Hey, you! You're not one of the militaries, are ye? Oh, I'd beat you up reel hard if you were!}
{102}{}{嘿，你！你不是军队的一员，是吗？哦，如果你是的话，我会狠狠揍你一顿！}
#{103}{}{Hey, It's you who managed to stir up the conscience o' thugs from the garrison? Thanks!}
{103}{}{嘿，是你挑起了守军暴徒的良心？谢谢！}
#{110}{}{[It seems that this weirdo likes to talk much and loud] Hey, you! Howdy! Come on, come to us! Come, I say! Aye-aye, I'm talkin' to ye! Won't refuse to keep us company, will ya? Don't just stand there, what am I, some wasteland nipper?! I've seen some stuff ye wouldn't believe!}
{110}{}{[看起来这个怪人喜欢大声说话]嘿，你！你好！快点，到我们这儿来！来吧，我说！是的，是的，我在和你说话！不会拒绝和我们作伴吧？别只是站在那里，我是什么，一个荒地杀手？！我见过一些你不相信的事！}
#{111}{}{Wait a minute, not so fast. Who are you exactly?}
{111}{}{等等，别那么快。你到底是谁？}
#{112}{}{Ah yeh, forgive a redneck. Our people are plain. What else we have to do, while waitin' fer crops to grow, or at the evenin', when it's dark at the yard? Only to chat and swing with fists. But I'm talkin' too much. Meet my daughter, Christine. Good girl, don't pay attention to her freckles [makes a sweet muzzle]. She's re-e-a-ally lovely, aren't she? Just look at her [Christine mutters under her breath with nasal voice, "da-a-ad!"]! Silence! Or I'll bash yer head and you'll shuddup reel fast!}
{112}{}{啊耶，原谅一个乡下人。我们的人民很普通。在等待庄稼生长的时候，或者在晚上，院子里天黑的时候，我们还能做什么？只是聊天和挥舞拳头。但我说得太多了。见见我女儿，克莉丝汀。好姑娘，别理她的雀斑。她真可爱，不是吗？看看她[克里斯蒂娜用鼻音低声咕哝着说，“达-阿-德！”]! 安静！否则我就揍你的头，你会很快脱掉卷轴！}
#{113}{}{Eh...}
{113}{}{呃。。。}
#{114}{}{Ahem. So I'm an ol' redneck. Name's Festus. Should be called John, would be more militant, but alright - Festus' fine too. Everyone around knows me! Ask any redneck in villages nearby - everyone tell good about Festus. Well, sometimes good, sometimes bad... But no' one treats me without respect. Aside from those thugs on the other side of the fence. Oh, I would beat them up reel hard, damn them all!}
{114}{}{啊哼。所以我是个老乡巴佬。我叫费斯托斯。应该叫约翰，会更激进，但好吧-费斯托斯也很好。周围的人都认识我！问问附近村子里的乡巴佬吧――每个人都对费斯托斯说好话。好吧，有时好，有时坏。。。但是没有人不尊重我。除了栅栏另一边的暴徒。哦，我会狠狠地揍他们，该死的！}
#{115}{}{Eh, can you elaborate? How did these militaries angered you, Festus?}
{115}{}{呃，你能详细说明一下吗？这些军队是怎么激怒你的，费斯托斯？}
#{116}{}{Straight to business - I like that! We'll get along well, son. Just keep your powder dry, as I always say, heh-heh!..}
{116}{}{直奔正题-我喜欢！我们会相处得很好的，儿子。保持你的粉末干燥，就像我常说的，嘿嘿！。。}
#{117}{}{About those militaries...}
{117}{}{关于那些军队。。。}
#{118}{}{Don't interrupt me! I almost gathered my thoughts... So, these militaries provoked us. O-oh, they provoked us so hard! They came to collect taxes, then one of them got a crush on my girl and dragged her right into the bushes! If I were nearby, I'd beat him reel hard! Only later we found out. We searched for our Christy everywhere, 'cuz she ran away to hide her disgrace. But you know, we, rednecks, care for each other! It's not the first time! Found her, warmed her up, and situation became clear. Now I'm lookin' for justice. I want to not just hammer private's face, but to make him answer before the family! But we couldn't get past the checkpoint. I got angry, beat up the guard, they chased me away. Now I don't even know what to do.}
{118}{}{别打断我！我几乎收集了我的想法。。。所以，这些军队激怒了我们。哦，他们太挑衅我们了！他们来收税，然后其中一个迷上了我的女儿，把她拖进了灌木丛！如果我在附近，我会狠狠地揍他！后来我们才发现。我们到处找我们的克丽丝蒂，因为她跑去掩饰她的耻辱。但是你知道，我们，乡巴佬，互相关心！这不是第一次了！找到她，让她热身，情况就明朗了。现在我在寻求正义。我不只是想敲打列兵的脸，而是想让他在家人面前回答！但我们无法通过检查站。我生气了，打了警卫，他们把我赶走了。现在我都不知道该怎么办了。}
#{119}{}{Ugh. Finally, at least something cleared up. So, one of privates raped your daughter, you angered and started the conflict at the checkpoint. Right?}
{119}{}{啊。最后，至少有些事情澄清了。所以，一个士兵强奸了你的女儿，你生气了，在检查站开始了冲突。对吗？}
#{120}{}{What else I could do? We weren't allowed inside, so I flamed up a bit. Anyway, they probably calmed down. And I'm also tired too. I'll sleep this night and go back to hittin' faces. You be sure about it.}
{120}{}{我还能做什么？我们不允许进去，所以我有点生气。不管怎样，他们可能平静下来了。我也很累。今天晚上我要睡觉，然后再去打脸。你要确定。}
#{121}{}{Could you tell me more?}
{121}{}{你能告诉我更多吗？}
#{122}{}{Huh? What's that? Now tell, don't be shy. Speak louder, it's rude to whisper among us.}
{122}{}{呵呵？那是什么？告诉我，别害羞。说大声点，在我们中间低声说话是不礼貌的。}
#{123}{}{Sorry for a question, but how old is your daughter?}
{123}{}{不好意思问你，你女儿多大了？}
#{124}{}{Sixteen! So what!?}
{124}{}{十六岁！那又怎么样！？}
#{125}{}{Don't be so nervous. It's just - that difference in age...}
{125}{}{别那么紧张。只是-年龄上的差异。。。}
#{126}{}{What the hell are ye implyin'!? Although, I know what ye talkin' about, these habits among ya cityfolks. We're different. Families are big. Do ya know how many kids I have? Seven! I swear! Every year my wife fires off a child, like there's a cannon between her legs  - bam! Bam! But Christine is our last, we won't handle any more. And you'd better ask, how old is my WIFE! Ha-ha-ha-ha-hah!}
{126}{}{你到底在祈求什么！？不过，我知道你们在说什么，这些城市居民的习惯。我们不一样。家庭很大。你知道我有几个孩子吗？七个！我发誓！每年我妻子都会放火射一个孩子，就像她两腿之间有一门大炮――砰！砰！但克莉丝汀是我们的最后一个，我们不会再处理了。你最好问问，我妻子多大了！哈哈哈哈哈！}
#{127}{}{Eh, I'd rather not.}
{127}{}{呃，我不想。}
#{128}{}{You said something about taxes?}
{128}{}{你说了些关于税收的事？}
#{129}{}{[Scratches his unshaven cheek, expressing absence of interest to this topic] Our village's small, just a few families, though big. And militaries are our guard. If somethin' happens - we can call for a help. In exchange we give them some grub. [Spits in between] No big deal.}
{129}{}{[抓着他没刮胡子的脸颊，表示对这个话题不感兴趣]我们村的小，只有几个家庭，虽然很大。军队是我们的卫兵。如果发生什么事-我们可以打电话求助。作为交换，我们给他们一些食物。没什么大不了的。}
#{130}{}{Who raped your daughter?}
{130}{}{谁强奸了你女儿？}
#{131}{}{A private, his name's Derren. Stupid name and pimly lad. But for us even this is enough. I saw him - sticks to the post, doesn't go anywhere. Ugh, when I get to him!}
{131}{}{一个二等兵，他叫德伦。愚蠢的名字和皮条客。但对我们来说这已经足够了。我看见他了-坚守岗位，哪儿也不去。啊，等我找到他！}
#{132}{}{And how the rape exactly happened?}
{132}{}{强奸到底是怎么发生的？}
#{133}{}{I will tell ya, but ye'll have to wash your ears with soap! We all gathered at the center of our village. Militaries rolled in, all so important, placed their watchers everywhere. And when there was time to leave, they lost their Derren - he just disappeared! Then I see him - he, asshole, exits the barn. At first I didn't understand what happened. He receives a reprimand and goes away with the others. As for Christine - she's nowhere in sights! We found her hour later, far away, sittin' on a cliff, I had never seen her like that. Bruises, blood and tears? No, not in our folk. She only said that she was with Derren in the barn. And then everythin' became obvious! The wife examines her and says that after 9 months we'll get another one in the family. Well, look, this is not how things are done, right? So I came for justice!}
{133}{}{我会告诉你的，但你得用肥皂洗耳朵！我们都聚集在村中心。军队蜂拥而至，如此重要，到处都有他们的观察者。当有时间离开时，他们失去了他们的德伦-他消失了！然后我看到他-他，混蛋，离开谷仓。一开始我不明白发生了什么。他受到训斥，和其他人一起走了。至于克莉丝汀-她不在视线中！一个小时后，我们在很远的地方找到了她，她坐在悬崖上，我从没见过她那样。瘀伤，血和眼泪？不，不是我们的人。她只说她和德伦在谷仓里。然后一切都变得显而易见！妻子给她做了检查，说9个月后我们家会再有一个。听着，事情不是这样的，对吧？所以我来伸张正义！}
#{134}{}{Perhaps I have enough information. Take care.}
{134}{}{也许我有足够的信息。当心。}
#{135}{}{Hm, listen, Festus. If she hadn't been beaten, tortured and she didn't call for help, then it's not considered rape. It's a... An innocent teenagers' stuff. I'm talking from experience.}
{135}{}{嗯，听着，费斯托斯。如果她没有被殴打，折磨，也没有呼救，那就不算强奸。这是。。。一个无辜的青少年的东西。我是凭经验说的。}
#{136}{}{WHAT!? Whatever you call this, but I'll do everythin' so this Derren came out of his dig and married my beautiful Christine!!!}
{136}{}{什么！？不管你怎么说，但我会做一切的，所以这个德伦从他的挖掘出来，娶了我美丽的克莉丝汀！！！}
#{137}{}{You don't mind another couple of questions?}
{137}{}{你不介意再问几个问题吗？}
#{138}{}{Wait a second, so, she hadn't been beaten, she didn't call for help and even asked his name and rank?}
{138}{}{等等，那么，她没有被打，她没有呼救，甚至没有问他的名字和军衔？}
#{139}{}{Well... That's right... Doesn't matter!!! I'll do everythin' so this Derren came out of his dig and married my beautiful Christine!!!}
{139}{}{好。。。这是正确的。。。没关系！！！我会做一切的，所以这个德伦从他的挖掘出来，娶了我美丽的克莉丝汀！！！}
#{140}{}{Festus, I think, you and your daughter should get out of here, as far away as you can.}
{140}{}{费斯托斯，我想，你和你女儿应该离开这里，越远越好。}
#{141}{}{Why?!}
{141}{}{为什么？}
#{142}{}{Just a feeling. Better answer a couple of questions.}
{142}{}{只是一种感觉。最好回答几个问题。}
#{143}{}{Well, eh, Derren set up the whole garrison against you. Even general Wesker is in. They'll stand for each other, rest assured.}
{143}{}{嗯，呃，德伦让整个卫戍部队都来对付你。就连韦斯克将军也在。他们会互相支持的，放心。}
#{144}{}{Because otherwise I'll end you right here.}
{144}{}{否则我就把你扔在这里。}
#{145}{}{Because I'll call my friends from the garrison, and they'll beat you up real hard.}
{145}{}{因为我会打电话给驻军的朋友，他们会狠狠揍你一顿。}
#{146}{}{Ugh, you're right... Nothin' will come out. How can we deal with them? And even the caravaneers won't be of help, if the military shows up. We'll have to go back to the village.}
{146}{}{呃，你说得对。。。不会有结果的。我们怎么对付他们？如果军队出现，即使是商队也帮不上忙。我们得回村子里去。}
#{147}{}{Happy trails.}
{147}{}{快乐的小径。}
#{148}{}{That's nothin', son! I'll show 'em! I've got powder fer everyone!}
{148}{}{没什么，儿子！我给他们看！我要给大家送粉！}
#{149}{}{In that case I'll end you right here.}
{149}{}{那样的话，我就在这里结束你。}
#{150}{}{Well, I'm here to warn you, next time you're on your own.}
{150}{}{好吧，我是来警告你的，下次你一个人的时候。}
#{151}{}{You know so much about all these militaries for a reason! What a scum you are! And your skin is so white, like yer hands never dig into the ground. Alright-alright, I get ye. We won't test our luck anymore, we'll go back to the village. But If I only get you on my way! Come on, Christine, we'll find you a man somewhere else.}
{151}{}{你对这些军队了解这么多是有原因的！你真是个人渣！你的皮肤是如此的白，就像你的手从来没有挖到地里。好吧，我明白了。我们不会再考验自己的运气了，我们要回村子里去。但如果我能带你上路！快点，克莉丝汀，我们会在别的地方给你找个人的。}
#{152}{}{You just stop this! I won't go anywhere until I make Derren marry my Christine! I WON'T LEAVE!}
{152}{}{你别说了！除非我让德伦娶了我的克莉丝汀，否则我哪儿也不去！我不走！}
#{153}{}{Then you're askin' for it. So long, old fella. [attack]}
{153}{}{那你就是在问。再见，老家伙。[攻击]}
#{1116}{}{Straight to business - I like that! We'll get along well, girl. Just keep your powder dry, as I always say, heh-heh!..}
{1116}{}{直奔正题-我喜欢！我们会相处得很好的，姑娘。保持你的粉末干燥，就像我常说的，嘿嘿！。。}
#{1148}{}{That's nothin', girlie! I'll show 'em! I've got powder fer everyone!}
{1148}{}{没什么，女孩！我给他们看！我要给大家送粉！}
