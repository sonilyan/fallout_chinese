### {10}{}{[The fumes of alcohol around him are so strong that could knock a Lavash down, but his faded eyes are looking at you quite soberly. You also notice that he is not as old as he looks.] Booze, drugs, and our star attraction - the Drop! If Apothecary doesn't have it, then no one has. So, what is it you like?}
{10}{}{[他周围的酒精味太浓了，可能会击倒一个熔岩，但他褪色的眼睛非常清醒地看着你。你还注意到他并没有看起来那么老。]酗酒、吸毒和我们的明星吸引力――滴滴答答！如果药剂师没有，那么就没有人有。那么，你喜欢什么？}

### {1003}{}{[Looks like he's strongly determined to break his own record for short-term cognac absorption. But for now, he is able to stand straight and put words into sentences] What? Did you come to drink for the Hog? I bet he's boiling in a pot filled with Drop... }
{1003}{}{[看起来他下定决心要打破自己短期吸收干邑的记录。但就目前而言，他能够站直了，把单词变成句子]什么？你是来给猪喝酒的吗？我打赌他在装满滴剂的锅里煮。。。}

{1018}{999}{我认为看到双头熔岩比你清醒时更有可能。。。好的，我得走了。照顾好你的肝脏。}
### {1005}{}{[drinks another shot, Not paying attention to the dirt and trash lying around] I was thinking that you left the place. Not that smart, huh?}

{1006}{}{[他红鼻子抽鼻子]我很高兴！为什么这么闷闷不乐？他妈的王国发生什么事了吗？坐下，让我们谈谈我们的生意。但请记住，我不接受妓女的服务作为报酬！}

{400}{011a}{我在找一种名为“Antiradine”的东西，你知道它是什么吗？}
### {401}{}{Hah, you kidding? This is just the place to get it. Deals with the radiation instantly, and has almost no side effects. We sometimes brew it right here, but mostly I'm selling the old stocks. The drug is not cheap but sells really well. Recently I even lost one dose to Mate... [he angrily throws his dirty cloth on the table]}
{401}{}{哈，你在开玩笑吗？这正是获得它的地方。立即处理辐射，几乎没有副作用。我们有时就在这里酿造，但大部分时间我都在卖老股票。这种药不便宜，但卖得很好。最近我甚至输了一剂给Mate。。。[他愤怒地把脏布扔在桌子上]}
### {402}{Barter}{Interesting. Let's take a look at your assortment again.}
{402}{Barter}{有趣的让我们再来看看您的产品组合。}
### {403}{010}{Thanks for the information. I wanted to ask something else.}

### {405}{}{Do you have something you need me to do? Like, work?}
{405}{}{你有什么事需要我做吗？比如，工作？}


### {110}{}{[he grins] Yeah. We don't like your nosy type around here, you know. }
{110}{}{[他咧嘴笑]是的。我们不喜欢你这种爱管闲事的人。}
### {111}{??????}{What do you mean? I just wanted to look at your stock. Let's barter, maybe?}
{111}{??????}{你是什么意思？我只是想看看你的股票。也许让我们以物易物吧？}
### {112}{022}{What's wrong with my type? Didn't Mate tell you about me?}
{112}{022}{我的打字有什么问题？Mate没有告诉你我的事吗？}
### {113}{999}{Then I better go.}
{113}{999}{那我最好走了。}


### {120}{}{ Why didn't you say so earlier! So, our Mate has found someone smart at last? Man, what times we live in - to put down a few ants and deliver a thing on the schedule is a problem now... Hm... Okay, get them here. Tell Mate that it's all good. And I'll drink for that... [he gulps from some bottle]}
{120}{}{你为什么不早点说呢！所以，我们的伴侣终于找到了一个聪明的人？伙计，我们生活在什么时代――放下几只蚂蚁，按计划交付一件东西，现在是个问题。。。嗯…好的，把他们带到这里。告诉Mate一切都很好。我会为此而喝酒。。。[他大口喝着]}
### {121}{013}{A pleasure to do business with you! }
{121}{013}{很高兴与您做生意！}
### {122}{013}{You could pour me a little. How do you even manage to drink so much and still talk... Okay, see you around.}
{122}{013}{你可以给我倒一点。你怎么能喝这么多还说话。。。好吧，回头见。}


### {1301}{}{Wait a sec... [he leans closer] See that creep in army jacket? No, not that one! To the right! A suspicious fella... Always hanging here, sniffing out something. I get nervous with someone this sketchy around. Can't even drink in peace. You look like a smart guy, maybe you can figure out what's his deal. What if he is with the Jackals? And he already knows most of the locals, but not you... I'll reward you with something worthy, don't you worry.}
{1301}{}{等一下…[他靠得更近了]看到那个穿着军夹克的家伙了吗？不，不是那个！向右！一个可疑的家伙。。。总是在这里徘徊，嗅出一些东西。我对周围这样粗略的人感到紧张。甚至不能平静地喝酒。你看起来像个聪明人，也许你能弄清楚他的交易是什么。如果他和豺狼队在一起呢？他已经认识大多数当地人了，但不认识你。。。我会奖励你一些有价值的东西，别担心。}
### {131}{999}{Okay, let's see what I can do... No promises though.}
{131}{999}{好吧，让我们看看我能做什么…不过没有承诺。}
### {1302}{}{[he smiles with a satisfied look] We do honest deals, you know! Just like in old times...}
{1302}{}{[他满意地笑了笑]我们做的是诚实的交易，你知道的！就像过去一样。。。}
### {132}{018}{By the way, can you tell me about the old times?}
{132}{018}{顺便问一下，你能告诉我过去的事吗？}
### {133}{??????}{Let's drink for that. What do you have in stock?}
{133}{??????}{让我们为此干杯。你们有什么存货？}
### {134}{999}{See you around, Apothecary.}
{134}{999}{回头见，药剂师。}
### {135}{014}{Hah, I dealt with this already!}
{135}{014}{哈，我已经处理好了！}


### {143}{}{[he leans even more closer] So? What's his deal?}
{143}{}{[他靠得更近了]那么？他的交易是什么？}
### {140}{015}{He is employed by the Olympus. His mission is to gather some stuff, and...}
{140}{015}{他受雇于奥林巴斯。他的任务是收集一些东西，然后。。。}
### {141}{017}{He is no one! He got lucky with getting a good suit of armor, but now he drinks himself away here. I bet he pops the Drop too... He is not dangerous. Did he visit something except a brothel and bar?}
{141}{017}{他不是一个人！他很幸运地得到了一套好盔甲，但现在他在这里喝得酩酊大醉。我打赌他也会跳投。。。他并不危险。除了妓院和酒吧，他有没有去过别的地方？}
### {142}{999}{Don't know for now, but I'm working on it.}
{142}{999}{现在还不知道，但我正在努力。}


### {150}{}{[he blinks, shocked] You... What are you trying to pull off here, you little shit? Is this some kind of a joke? I need the truth, not your stupid tales!}
{150}{}{[他眨了眨眼，震惊了]你。。。你想在这里干什么，你这个小混蛋？这是在开玩笑吗？我需要真相，而不是你那些愚蠢的故事！}
### {151}{016}{IT IS the truth! I've got it all worked out, what else do you want from me? Is everyone around here this tight?}
{151}{016}{这是事实！我已经解决了，你还想从我这里得到什么？这里的每个人都这么紧吗？}
### {152}{017}{Huh... Er... Sorry, that was a bad one. He is just a drunkard. Not related to Jackals. Did you have something on him, except your suspicions?}
{152}{017}{嗯。。。呃…对不起，那是一个糟糕的。他只是个酒鬼。与豺狼无关。除了你的怀疑，你对他有什么了解吗？}
### {153}{999}{Hey, hey! Chill out! I'd better come later...}
{153}{999}{嘿，嘿！冷静！我最好晚点来。。。}


### {160}{}{[very hastily, he pulls out the weapon] That's it, I'm sick of your bullshit, you asshole! Are you trying to fuck me up? Did you conspire with him? Do you think that Apothecary is senile? [shouts to the guards] Hey boys, someone here needs the shit beaten out of him!}
{160}{}{[他很匆忙地拔出武器]就是这样，我受够了你的胡说八道，你这个混蛋！你是想搞砸我吗？你和他合谋了吗？你认为药剂师老了吗？[对警卫喊道]嘿，伙计们，这里有人需要把他打得落花流水！}
### {161}{998}{Oh man...}
{161}{998}{天啊。。。}


### {170}{}{[disappointedly pours another shot] Well, I mean, yeah, he was never noticed near the lab or barracks... But - you know how it is. Nowadays, if you are not paranoid, it doesn't mean that no one wants to kill you. [he sighs] Okay, you did your part. Here. It's called "Rapture". It's a sample, not in mass production for now. The effect is something you've never felt before. I mean it.}
{170}{}{[失望地又倒了一枪]嗯，我的意思是，是的，他在实验室或营房附近从未被注意到。。。但是，你知道这是怎么回事。如今，如果你不是偏执狂，并不意味着没有人想杀你。[他叹了口气]好吧，你尽了自己的本分。在这里它被称为“猛禽”。这是一个样品，目前还没有大规模生产。这种效果是你以前从未感受到的。我是认真的。}
### {171}{999}{If you say so... I'll figure it out. See you soon!}
{171}{999}{如果你这么说…我会想出来的。再见！}


### {180}{}{[he scratches his neck] Yes, now it's not like the old times... Do you know that we used to run with the Jackals? I knew the Jackal himself, he was... The real deal. Which I can't say about his son, Loudmouth - that one's totally gone off his nut. Once we raided a caravan, and one of our guys got in the line of fire. If you think that Loudmouth stopped shooting, you are fucking wrong! That lad ended up crawling around with his insides all over the place, with Loudmouth laughing... So we talked about it and decided to move on. And moved here.}
{180}{}{[他挠了挠脖子]是的，现在不像以前了。。。你知道我们以前和豺狼一起跑步吗？我认识豺狼，他是。。。真正的交易。关于他的儿子，我不能这么说，Loudmouth――那个人完全疯了。有一次，我们突袭了一辆大篷车，我们的一个人上了火线。如果你认为Loudmouth停止了射击，那你他妈的错了！那个小伙子最后爬来爬去，内脏到处都是，大声笑着。。。所以我们讨论了一下，决定继续前进。然后搬到了这里。}
### {181}{019}{Interesting. Go on.}
{181}{019}{有趣的继续}
### {182}{999}{I see. Well, it's time for me to go.}
{182}{999}{我明白了。好吧，我该走了。}


### {190}{}{This place was a pre-war factory of some kind. I mean, not completely intact, much of it was looted. But still, some big-brained settled here, kickstarting the production of chemicals. One of them, Carlos Young, invented the thing we call the Drop. Dope shit! Although, I prefer cognac... Anyway, we seized the factory. Nothing to say, really - who could oppose us? So, that's how it all started. And it was good... [he starts wiping the table with a saddened look]}
{190}{}{这个地方是某种战前的工厂。我的意思是，不是完全完好无损，大部分都被洗劫一空。但尽管如此，一些头脑清醒的人还是在这里定居下来，开始了化学品的生产。其中一个叫Carlos Young的人发明了我们称之为Drop的东西。狗屁！虽然，我更喜欢干邑。。。不管怎样，我们占领了工厂。没什么好说的，真的――谁能反对我们？所以，这就是一切的开始。这很好。。。[他开始用悲伤的表情擦桌子]}
### {191}{020}{Why so sad if all was good?}
{191}{020}{如果一切都好，为什么这么难过？}
### {192}{999}{I think that's enough for today. I'd better go.}
{192}{999}{我想今天就够了。我最好去。}


### {200}{}{It was good... Before. Then some started whining. Whining about how bad it is that we "exploit locals". Can you believe that? Bad! And all this despite us keeping things in order here, chopping balls of every scumbag who dares to bust things up! If it was Loudmouth who took over, everything here would go to shit already! He would definitely stuff his ass full of Drop and murdered every smart-ass... Unlike Hog. Hog never wanted for everyone to dance to his tune. Just pay for protection in time, and have no worries at all. Except lately he is too dependent on the Drop too...}
{200}{}{很好。。。之前然后一些人开始抱怨。抱怨我们“剥削当地人”有多糟糕。你能相信吗？令人不快的尽管我们把这里的一切都整理好了，砍下了每一个敢于把事情搞砸的卑鄙小人的球！如果是Loudmouth接手的话，这里的一切都会变得一团糟！他肯定会在屁股上塞满Drop并谋杀每一个聪明的家伙。。。不像猪。霍格从不希望每个人都跟着他的调子跳舞。只要及时支付保护费用，就可以完全不用担心。只是最近他太依赖Drop了。。。}
### {201}{021}{I don't quite get what you're trying to say.}
{201}{021}{我不太明白你想说什么。}


### {210}{}{I mean this - look around you. No one here cares about anything anymore. The territory is full of some shady assholes loitering around, the number of problems is increasing... And the Hog, you know... I'm worried. What would happen if the Hog kicks the bucket? I'm too old for this shit, and I fail to see any worthy candidates to keep things tight... I think I'm talking too much. It's nice to remember the old times, but enough for now. Come around, if you want to make business.}
{210}{}{我的意思是――看看你周围。这里再也没有人关心任何事情了。领土上到处都是一些见不得人的混蛋，问题越来越多。。。还有猪，你知道。。。我很担心。如果猪踢了桶会发生什么？我年纪太大了，不适合做这件事，我看不到任何有价值的候选人来保持紧张。。。我觉得我说得太多了。回忆过去很好，但现在已经足够了。来吧，如果你想做生意的话。}
### {211}{999}{Thanks for the information. I definitely will.}
{211}{999}{谢谢你提供的信息。我一定会的。}


### {220}{}{He tells me a lot of things. He is here to prevent people I don't know from loitering around the Rainbow. And he is not good at his job, if you ask me. Still, he mentioned you. But does it matter if you came empty-handed?}
{220}{}{他告诉我很多事情。他来这里是为了防止我不认识的人在彩虹附近闲逛。如果你问我的话，他不擅长他的工作。不过，他还是提到了你。但是，如果你两手空空地来，有关系吗？}
### {221}{012}{Actually, I have a package for you. From your insect friends. Ant belly delivery!}
{221}{012}{事实上，我有一个包裹给你。来自你的昆虫朋友。蚂蚁肚子分娩！}
### {222}{999}{I'll come back later then.}
{222}{999}{那我晚些时候回来。}


### {2301}{}{[he gives you a friendly smile, then swiftly grabs your throat and hisses] Here's how it is, little shit - one old man just decided to ramble about good old days with another customer. Nothing more. I don't know you. I won't discuss something serious with you. And if you keep talking like that, I'm going to feed your liver to the dogs. }
{2301}{}{[他友好地笑了你一笑，然后迅速掐住你的喉咙发出嘶嘶声]事情是这样的，小混蛋――一位老人刚刚决定和另一位顾客聊聊过去的美好时光。没什么了。我不认识你。我不会和你讨论一些严肃的事情。如果你一直这样说，我会把你的肝脏喂给狗。}
### {231}{999}{Hey, no hands! I didn't mean anything bad. Let's talk later when we... Get to know each other better.}
{231}{999}{嘿，没有手！我没有恶意。我们稍后再谈。。。更好地了解彼此。}
### {232}{029}{Ow! Ye old ass, I'll cook YOUR liver if you won't get your meat hooks off me! }
{232}{029}{噢你这个老混蛋，如果你不把你的肉钩从我身上拿下来，我就煮你的肝！}
### {2302}{}{[he shrugs, drinking two shots simultaneously] I see you are okay. So, here's some free advice - lay off this chat. I won't make any move, while Hog is still around, keeping things in order. }
{2302}{}{[他耸耸肩，同时喝了两杯]我看你没事。所以，这里有一些免费的建议-停止聊天。我不会采取任何行动，而霍格仍在身边，保持秩序。}
### {233}{999}{Then let's drink for him staying in charge for many years to come. Although now you should be very careful when betting on someone... Think about it.}
{233}{999}{那么，让我们为他在未来的许多年里继续掌权而干杯。尽管现在你在赌某人时应该非常小心。。。想想看。}
### {234}{999}{Of course. We're done with this topic.}
{234}{999}{当然这个话题我们讲完了。}


### {240}{}{Yeah... The bloodbath can start at any moment. And, as I said, I'm getting a little old for this shit. Mate is trying to hold things up, but with little results.}
{240}{}{是 啊血洗随时可能开始。而且，正如我所说，我有点老了。Mate试图拖延，但收效甚微。}
### {241}{025}{Maybe it's time to deal with the situation. What do you think?}
{241}{025}{也许是时候处理这种情况了。你怎么看？}
### {242}{999}{Good luck to you both then. See you around.}
{242}{999}{祝你们俩好运。回头见。}


### {2501}{}{All you can deal with is your thingy by the toilet. Who do you think you are, telling me this? Get the fuck away, don't piss me off!}
{2501}{}{你所能处理的就是你在厕所旁边的东西。你以为你是谁，告诉我这些？走开，别惹我生气！}
### {251}{029}{That's it asshole, I'm sick of it! Let's check if you have booze instead of blood!}
{251}{029}{就是这样，混蛋，我受够了！让我们检查一下你是否有酒而不是血！}
### {252}{999}{Okay, better to talk about it later then.}
{252}{999}{好吧，那以后再谈吧。}
### {2502}{}{[looks at you with caution] Why do you say that?}
{2502}{}{[谨慎地看着你]你为什么这么说？}
### {253}{026}{I have a strange feeling about this. That Mate can join the Hog soon. You know, poisoning, for example. I don't even know where these thoughts come from. Maybe it's something in the air...}
{253}{026}{我对此有一种奇怪的感觉。那个伙伴很快就能加入猪队了。例如，中毒。我甚至不知道这些想法是从哪里来的。也许是空气中的某种东西。。。}
### {254}{028}{I don't really want to elaborate on that. Let's talk like businessmen - if someone would pay you a huge amount of money for, I don't know, some deadly poison, to deal with huge rats - would you question it?}
{254}{028}{我真的不想详细说明。让我们像商人一样说话――如果有人付给你一大笔钱，买一些致命的毒药，我不知道，用来对付大老鼠――你会质疑吗？}
### {255}{999}{I dunno... Oh! Look at the time! Bye, Apothecary.}
{255}{999}{我不知道。。。哦看时间！再见，药剂师。}


### {260}{}{[he looks around and lowers his voice] Everything can happen... what's on your mind?}
{260}{}{[他环顾四周，压低声音]一切都有可能发生。。。你在想什么？}
### {261}{027}{What if someone, pretty good at cooking some deadly concoctions, would make some... Food supplement? And give it to someone, representing another someone, who would remember this favor? There's nothing better for good people than a mutually beneficial partnership, right? When the secrets can be kept, of course.}
{261}{027}{如果有人，非常擅长烹饪一些致命的混合物，会做一些。。。食物补充？把它交给一个人，代表另一个人，谁会记得这个人情？对好人来说，没有什么比互利的伙伴关系更好的了，对吧？当然，什么时候可以保守秘密。}


### {270}{}{[he chuckles] You are such a weasel... You're gonna go far, kid. Okay, "someone" agrees - but only to produce the supplement and to give it to another "someone". Nothing more.}
{270}{}{[他笑了笑]你真是个黄鼠狼。。。你会走得很远的，孩子。好吧，“某人”同意――但只是为了生产补充剂并将其提供给另一个“某人”。没什么了。}
### {271}{999}{I don't need more. And I hope we don't have to talk about this again.}
{271}{999}{我不需要更多了。我希望我们不必再谈论这个了。}


### {280}{}{[he hesitates, nervously scratching his chin, but still firmly nods] This might be possible, yeah. Why not? The rats are the size of Mate, I suppose? It's going to be a difficult job... I could try - for a thousand batteries. }
{280}{}{[他犹豫了一下，紧张地抓着下巴，但仍然坚定地点头]这可能是可能的，是的。为什么不呢？我想这些老鼠有Mate那么大吧？这将是一项艰巨的工作。。。我可以试试――一千块电池。}
### {281}{999}{Deal. Here's the money. Wait for someone from me.}
{281}{999}{处理这是钱。等我的人。}
### {282}{999}{Damn, that's a lot... Let's pretend we didn't talk. If something comes up, I know where to find you.}
{282}{999}{妈的，太多了。。。我们假装没说话。如果有什么事发生，我知道在哪里可以找到你。}


### {290}{}{[He jumps away, pulling out his weapon] Boys! Let's put down this motherfucker!}
{290}{}{[他跳开，拔出武器]孩子们！让我们放下这个混蛋！}
### {291}{998}{They won't help you, drunkard!}
{291}{998}{他们不会帮你的，酒鬼！}


### {300}{}{Don't care. I won't be staying here for long. Just need to finish a couple of matters with the Brick. By the way, can you fetch him this package of booze? Ah, forget it, you will drink it all on the way...}
{300}{}{不要在意。我不会在这里呆太久。只需要和Brick一起完成几件事。顺便问一下，你能给他拿这包酒吗？啊，忘了它，你会在路上喝光的。。。}
### {301}{999}{Then I need to go. Was nice seeing you... I guess.}
{301}{999}{那我得走了。很高兴见到你。。。我想。}


### {3101}{}{Understood! [he pulls a bag from under the register] Everything is here, Boss, down to the last battery!}
{3101}{}{明白了！[他从收银机下掏出一个袋子]老板，一切都在这里，直到最后一个电池！}
### {311}{999}{I believe you, it's not a hooch. See you around, Apothecary.}
{311}{999}{我相信你，这不是胡扯。回头见，药剂师。}
### {3102}{}{All good! I remember the deadlines - 5th and 20th.}
{3102}{}{一切都好！我记得截止日期――5号和20号。}
### {312}{999}{Great. Try to get sober until that, for a change.}
{312}{999}{太棒了试着在那之前保持清醒，换一种方式。}


### {3201}{}{Can't really complain - and don't want to jinx it. The Drop sales are increasing, the bar is thriving too. At last, the Rainbow has some order! Fuck me molerat, you do know how to pull shit together here! I couldn't even dream of something like this...}
{3201}{}{我真的不能抱怨，也不想倒霉。Drop的销售额在增加，酒吧也在蓬勃发展。彩虹终于有了秩序！他妈的，莫拉特，你知道怎么在这里拉屎！我甚至做梦也想不到这样的事情。。。}
### {321}{999}{Don't forget who you owe this to. See you around.}
{321}{999}{别忘了你欠谁的。回头见。}
### {3202}{}{Can't really complain - and don't want to jinx it. Of course, the profits are not the same without the Drop, but at least the Rainbow has some order! Fuck me molerat, you do know how to pull shit together here! I couldn't even dream of something like this...}
{3202}{}{我真的不能抱怨，也不想给它带来厄运。当然，没有Drop的利润就不一样了，但至少Rainbow有一些订单！他妈的，莫拉特，你知道怎么在这里拉屎！我甚至做梦也想不到这样的事情。。。}
### {322}{999}{Don't forget who you owe this to. See you around.}
{322}{999}{别忘了你欠谁的。回头见。}


### {3301}{}{[he shows you empty hands] Easy, champ. Give a couple of minutes, we need to have a serious talk. The boys who went with Hog asked me to discuss one thing.}
{3301}{}{[他向你展示了空荡荡的双手]放松，冠军。给我几分钟时间，我们需要认真谈谈。和霍格一起去的男孩们让我讨论一件事。}
### {331}{034}{I hope it's worth it.}
{331}{034}{我希望这是值得的。}
### {332}{034}{I'm listening.}
{332}{034}{我在听。}
### {3302}{}{[his eyes burn with strange fire, hand itches to grab the nearest bottle] So, it's done... I didn't waste my time too - pushed some of our best guys in the right direction. }
{3302}{}{[他的眼睛被奇怪的火焰灼伤，手发痒，想抓住最近的瓶子]所以，它完成了。。。我也没有浪费时间――把我们最好的球员推向了正确的方向。}
### {333}{034}{And?}
{333}{034}{和}
### {334}{034}{This is in your own interests. You didn't surprise me.}
{334}{034}{这符合你自己的利益。你没有让我感到惊讶。}


### {3401}{}{[his squinted eyes look at you for some time. Then he starts talking.] You wasted the Hog. And it is a big problem because he held the place together. And we don't want everything here to go to shit. This place needs someone cheeky enough to lead it. And we are observing your doings for a long time already - the Rainbow makes everyone show their true colors, you know... So, my boys think that you are suited for this position, and I agree with them. Your turn, champ. Tell me what you think. And take this, as a gesture of goodwill. It's called "Rapture" - pretty rare stuff, you won't find it anywhere else. [he hands you something]}
{3401}{}{[他斜视的眼睛看了你一段时间。然后他开始说话。]你浪费了猪。这是一个大问题，因为他把这个地方团结在一起。我们不希望这里的一切都变得一团糟。这个地方需要一个足够厚颜无耻的人来领导它。我们已经观察了你很长一段时间了――彩虹让每个人都展示了他们的本色，你知道。。。所以，我的孩子们认为你适合这个职位，我同意他们的看法。轮到你了，冠军。告诉我你的想法。并将此视为一种善意的姿态。它被称为“猛禽”――非常罕见的东西，你在其他地方找不到。[他递给你一些东西]}
### {341}{036}{Why the hell not? I think I can do it. No need for the inauguration, I'm too humble for that.}
{341}{036}{为什么不呢？我想我能做到。不需要就职典礼，我太谦虚了。}
### {342}{036}{I'm in. Tell me what's the deal around here at the moment.}
{342}{036}{我来了。告诉我现在这是怎么回事。}
### {343}{035}{Nah, it's not for me. Solve your problems by yourselves.}
{343}{035}{不，这不适合我。你们自己解决问题。}
### {3402}{}{[he makes a long gulp, pouring the rest of the booze down his throat] Phew... The thing is - the boys root for you. They think that the Hog solved problems... Not in a very flexible way - but he solved them. Mate was like that too. But in the current situation, we need someone smarter. That's when I thought about you, so - what do you think about leading the place? The Rainbow awaits, kid! }
{3402}{}{[他喝了一大口，把剩下的酒倒进喉咙]哇。。。问题是，男孩们支持你。他们认为猪解决了问题。。。不是以一种非常灵活的方式――但他解决了这些问题。Mate也是这样。但在目前的情况下，我们需要一个更聪明的人。那是我想到你的时候，所以――你觉得领导这个地方怎么样？彩虹在等着你，孩子！}
### {344}{036}{Good. Fill me in - what should I start with?}
{344}{036}{好的告诉我――我应该从什么开始？}
### {345}{035}{You know, I've been thinking... I have my own problems. It's too much to do here. I'll pass.}
{345}{035}{你知道，我一直在想。。。我也有自己的问题。在这里要做的事太多了。我会通过的。}


### {350}{}{[looks like he can't believe what you've just said] You... You are fucking... Quitting? Why the fuck did you start this mess then?}
{350}{}{[看起来他简直不敢相信你刚才说的话]你。。。你他妈的。。。退出？那你他妈的为什么要搞砸？}
### {351}{037}{I just like to beat the shit out of people, that's it.}
{351}{037}{我只是喜欢把人打得落花流水，就这样。}
### {352}{037}{Maybe I had my beef with Mate? Maybe I just screwed you over because of my own interests? Maybe I don't really care about the Rainbow? As I said - no.}
{352}{037}{也许我和Mate有过节？也许我只是因为我自己的利益而把你搞砸了？也许我真的不在乎彩虹？正如我所说――不。}
### {353}{037}{I had my reasons. Thanks for the offer, but my answer stays the same.}
{353}{037}{我有自己的理由。谢谢你的提议，但我的回答是不变的。}


### {360}{}{[he exhales in relief] Listen then. Your job is to keep things going. Business matters must be carried out without problems. Don't worry about our stuff, we will take care of it. Once in a month, you will be getting your cut for security. The rest you'll figure out. Everything depends on how you act now. And - congratulations, Boss! I should definitely drink for that, just a second...}
{360}{}{[他松了一口气]然后听。你的工作就是让事情继续下去。商业事务必须顺利进行。别担心我们的东西，我们会处理好的。一个月一次，你会得到你的安全保障。剩下的你会想明白的。一切都取决于你现在的行为。祝贺你，老板！我绝对应该为此而喝酒，就一秒钟。。。}
### {361}{999}{Nice. But if you think you can relax, you are dead wrong. You are free to go. I'd like to look around my domain.}
{361}{999}{美好的但如果你认为你可以放松，那你大错特错了。你可以自由走了。我想看看我的域名。}
### {362}{999}{I see. Now, I need to think everything over - and don't worry, I won't forget your role in it.}
{362}{999}{我明白了。现在，我需要把一切都想清楚――别担心，我不会忘记你在其中的角色。}

### {370}{}{[looks like he is going to throw himself at you, but instead, he suddenly goes limp] That's your choice then. Don't regret it. [he turns away.]}
{370}{}{[看起来他要扑向你，但他突然一瘸一拐]那是你的选择。别后悔。[他转过身去了。]}
### {371}{999}{[end]}
{371}{999}{[终止]}
