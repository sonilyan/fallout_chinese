#{900}{}{Foreword Our organization, the Mutant Hunters, grows with every passing day, and this gives me the conviction that we will one day reach our common goal - the salvation of pure humans from mutants. When that blessed time comes, however, it will be necessary to remember what preceded so that the people who fought for the safety of others, and everything they had to sacrifice, is not forgotten. It should also serve as a warning that this must not happen again, so that mutants and mutations may never threaten the lives of pure humans ever again.}
{900}{}{前言：我们的组织，突变体猎人，与日俱增，这让我坚信，我们终有一天会达到我们的共同目标――从突变体中拯救纯净的人类。然而，当那神圣的时刻到来时，我们必须记住之前发生的一切，这样，那些为他人的安全而战的人们，以及他们必须牺牲的一切，就不会被遗忘。它也应该作为一个警告，这绝不能再次发生，使突变和突变可能永远不会威胁到纯人类的生命。}

#{904}{}{That's why I wrote this history of the Hunters, which may also be the only thing left after us should the last Mutant Hunter fall. If that happens, let this document be a moral support for those that would follow in our steps. Let them know there were people before them that were determined to fight against the mutants, so they may learn from the mistakes which may have led to our demise.  Sebastian}

I saw that decline of humanity, I saw it rushing to its destruction, and decided to do something about it.}

#{1000}{}{There were always enough groups of pure humans strong enough to survive, but their lives were without meaning, without purpose. They were merely surviving, and their existence meant nothing on its own. But when I showed them what I'd seen, they understood me, and saw the danger threatening all pure humans on their own. They joined me, and I united them with a promise that we'll rid the world of mutants - a promise that I hope we'll one day fulfill.}

#{1050}{}{We helped villages and towns, ridding them of the foul mutants, despite the nonsensical resistance of the local people. But above all, we grew stronger. Not only were we joined by more and more pure humans willing to fight, we also searched for forgotten pre-war weapons and armor that would helps us in our fight. This was necessary because units created by the mad Master with the help of the betrayers of the human race, the Children of the Cathedral, were already spreading across the wasteland. We fought the super mutants many times. We killed many of them, but many brave Hunters died as well.}
{1050}{}{我们帮助了村庄和城镇，清除了肮脏的变种人，尽管当地人民进行了荒谬的抵抗。但最重要的是，我们变得更强大了。我们不仅有越来越多愿意战斗的纯人类加入，我们还寻找被遗忘的战前武器和盔甲来帮助我们战斗。这是必要的，因为疯狂的主人在人类叛徒的帮助下创造的单位，大教堂的孩子们，已经遍布荒地。我们和超级变种人打过很多次。我们杀了很多人，但也有很多勇敢的猎人死了。}

#{1100}{}{Thanks to our efforts, the super mutants stopped appearing in our territory and remained far in the west. But then a new menace appeared - the Rebirth. The Rebirth is some new religion that spread amongst the ghouls, and they, armed with the best weapons people had created before the war, started to pillage towns and villages. We don't know where they got such equipment, or anything about their foolish faith. The ghouls talk only of someone called Savior, no doubt another disgusting mutant. Not only do they kill in his name, they also capture pure humans and take them away, but we don't know where or why.}
{1100}{}{多亏了我们的努力，超级变种人不再出现在我们的领土上，而留在遥远的西部。但随后一个新的威胁出现了――重生。重生是一些在僵尸中传播的新宗教，他们用战争前人们创造的最好的武器武装起来，开始掠夺城镇和村庄。我们不知道他们从哪里弄到这样的设备，也不知道他们愚蠢的信仰。僵尸只谈论一个叫救世主的人，毫无疑问是另一个恶心的变种人。他们不仅以他的名义杀人，还俘虏了纯洁的人类并将他们带走，但我们不知道在哪里，也不知道为什么。}

#{1150}{}{So we continued to look for pre-war technology, as well as new allies. We found both in the only city that resisted the Rebirth in the area. Or at least we thought so. We came to Albuquerque, the city that had already endured a large ghoul attack, and offer our help and an alliance. But we were refused, offered only a twisted agreement concluded in 2157. In return for defending Albuquerque against the invaders, we were allowed to eradicate the threat within the city! They "graciously" gave us the permission to purge the city of mutants, when it should've been their natural duty as pure humans! And all we received was the minimum material required for the construction of our base. People of the empire, blinded by their easy lives, didn't realize the threat that Rebirth posed. And not only the Rebirth, but all mutants.}
{1150}{}{所以我们继续寻找战前的技术，以及新的盟友。我们在这个地区唯一一个抵制重生的城市发现了这两个。至少我们是这么想的。我们来到阿尔伯克基，这座城市已经经历了一次大规模的僵尸袭击，并提供了我们的帮助和联盟。但我们被拒绝了，只有一个扭曲的协议在2157年达成。作为对保卫阿尔伯克基抵抗侵略者的回报，我们被允许在城市内部消除威胁！他们“仁慈地”允许我们清除城市里的变种人，而这本应该是他们作为纯人类的自然职责！我们得到的只是建造基地所需的最低材料。帝国的人民被他们安逸的生活蒙蔽了双眼，没有意识到重生带来的威胁。不仅是重生，还有所有的变种。}

#{1200}{}{In 2160, many dwellers paid for their foolishness with their lives. The ghouls mustered enough strength for a second large attack on the city. Without tactics or reason, they ferociously threw themselves at Albuquerque. Their better weapons and especially their numerical superiority allowed them to penetrate deep into the city. While confusion spread amongst the imperial soldiers, we Mutant Hunters eventually forced the ghouls to retreat. But not even after our triumph did the emperor offer us the technology and equipment that they have amply available. The only thing he agreed with was the construction of a wall around the entire city. There was plenty of material available. Not only from around the city, but especially from the ruins that remained after the ghoul invasion. That destroyed part of the city has been called the Dead Quarter ever since.}
{1200}{}{2160年，许多居民为自己的愚蠢付出了生命代价。僵尸们聚集了足够的力量，准备对这座城市进行第二次大规模袭击。没有策略和理由，他们凶猛地扑向阿尔伯克基。他们更好的武器，特别是他们的数字优势，使他们能够深入到城市。当混乱在帝国士兵中蔓延时，我们变异猎人最终迫使僵尸撤退。但即使在我们胜利之后，皇帝也没有向我们提供他们所拥有的技术和设备。他唯一同意的是在整个城市周围建一堵墙。有很多可用的材料。不仅来自城市周围，尤其是在僵尸入侵后留下的废墟上。这座城市被毁的部分从此被称为死亡区。}

#{1250}{}{Our relentless search across the wasteland finally bore fruit in 2161. We discovered an old army warehouse, and turned it into our second base. Thanks to its excellent location, it remains hidden from the Rebirth patrols that frequently appear in the area. Thus, we don't have to take the captured ghouls far, and especially not into a city that we strive to keep clean from mutants. That's why the base, headed by commander Tunrida, is mostly use for interrogations and conducting tests on the mutants.}
{1250}{}{我们在荒地上的不懈搜寻终于在2161年取得了成果。我们发现了一个旧的军用仓库，把它变成了我们的第二个基地。由于其优越的地理位置，它仍然隐藏在重生巡逻，经常出现在该地区。因此，我们不必把俘虏的僵尸带得很远，尤其不必带到一个我们努力不让变种人进入的城市。这就是为什么这个由图里达指挥官领导的基地主要用于审问和测试突变体。}

#{1300}{}{In 2166, we finally took at least a part of what rightfully belongs to us. We defend Albuquerque from mutants both inside and outside, and the empire still refuses to help us. We defend their lives, as well as the lives of all pure humans, and they refuse to give us the technology that would be of incredible help not only in our fight against the Rebirth, but all the mutants! That's why we took the third floor of their Vault by force. We used killers genetically engineered by pre-war scientists to capture the floor without the empire suspecting a thing. The emperor responded to the loss of the two floors of their Vault by shutting the Imperial City off from the rest of Albuquerque, proving that there was no one capable of sensible leadership among the descendants of the Vault 16 dwellers.}
{1300}{}{在2166年，我们终于拿走了至少一部分本该属于我们的东西。我们保护阿尔伯克基不受内外变异人的攻击，帝国仍然拒绝帮助我们。我们捍卫他们的生命，以及所有纯人类的生命，他们拒绝给我们技术，这将是难以置信的帮助，不仅在我们打击重生，但所有的变种人！所以我们强行占领了他们地下室的三楼。我们用战前科学家基因改造的杀手占领了地面，帝国对此毫无怀疑。皇帝对失去两层地窖的反应是，将皇城与阿尔伯克基的其他地方隔离开来，这证明在16号地窖的后代中，没有一个人能够胜任明智的领导。}

#{1350}{}{Update December 9, 2169: A few days earlier, we received a message from Tunrida saying that they've finally managed to break one of the Rebirth ghouls during interrogation, and gain new information. She was apparently close to discovering the location of their base. However, the base has not responded to any of our calls since then. Until a group of our scouts discovered that it was occupied by super mutants. The foul beasts killed every Hunter stationed in the base, and it can be assumed that they destroyed everything there.}
