{100}{}{[As you walk inside, the first thing you notice is a big gun barrel pointed at your head.] What the hell are you
 doing here? I almost fried your sorry ass!}
{101}{}{What's going on here?}
{102}{}{Do you mind... moving that thing off my face, please?}
{103}{}{Back off buddy, I ain't telling you shit!}
#going on...
{104}{}{Have you been living under a rock... Hey wait. [Looking closely at you.] You must be that newcomer... Jerry
 said a few things about you. [He puts down the gun.] Sorry about that, formality, you know... Say, how did you get past
 those things?}
{105}{}{Well, I killed them...}
{106}{}{Well, I managed to sneak past them...}
#killed...
{107}{}{Damn, you shouldn't have done that. You see I am, hmm... was... conducting some research on deathclaw
 migration. Jerry asked me to track down the individuals, find patterns in their movement, anything that could lead
 us to their nest. Of course, we'll put them down eventually because they are too close to our homes to be ignored. [He
 looks at you.] Don't worry, more will come, however, it's very important that I finish my work before they start coming
 in much greater numbers.}
{108}{}{I understand. Tell me what happened here.}
#here...
{109}{}{Old story... You see, miners used to live in these buildings. This was once a densely populated area but since
 the mine became more and more dangerous to work at, and some say it also got unprofitable, people started leaving,
 searching for a better life. Sadly, most of them failed...}
{110}{}{Why?}
{111}{}{I see, thanks for the story.}
#why?
{112}{}{You could ask them the same question but I doubt they will hear you. Because they are dead, that's why!}
{113}{}{Oh, sorry, I didn't know that.}
#
{114}{}{Don't be, I had a lot of time to deal with the loss. Now it's time to move on and make sure things get
 better or at least try not to make them any worse. See you later, I have to finish some reports.}
{115}{}{Sure thing.}
#do you mind...
{116}{}{What if I don't... Who are you?}
{117}{}{Well, I'm a traveler from the north.}
{118}{}{It's none of your damn business!}
#traveler...
{119}{}{Then you need to know that this is a restricted area and... Hey, wait a second! [Looking closely at
 you.] You must be that newcomer... Jerry said a few things about you. [He puts down the gun.] Sorry about that,
 formality, you know... Say, how did you get past those things?}
{120}{}{It wasn't easy but I killed them.}
{121}{}{Well, I managed to sneak past them...}
{122}{}{Well, I have my ways.}
#sneak, ways...
{123}{}{Yeah right, and what about those noises I've heard?}
{124}{}{Uh... self-defense?}
#again...
{125}{}{Nice to see you again but you should avoid this place in the future. I have a very important research project to
 work on.}
{126}{}{Can I ask you something?}
{127}{}{Oh, sure.}
#
{128}{}{Alright, just be quick about it!}
{129}{}{Tell me about this place. Why is it in ruins?}
{130}{}{What do you do here?}
{131}{}{On second thought, there's nothing I need to know right now.}
#do here... general exposition
{132}{}{I am conducting research on deathclaw migration. Jerry asked me to track down the individuals, find their
 movement pattern and trace it back to the source. You see, eventually, we will have to "clean out" their nest, wherever
 it is. [Shakes his head.] All this time they've been breeding and pushing further out, right up to the city limits. If we
 wait any longer they will start pushing over our homes. Once that happens, there may be no stopping them. That's
 why it's so important that I finish my work in time.}
{133}{}{What happened to the people that used to live here?}
{134}{}{I'll be going now, thanks for your time.}
#about the place...
{135}{}{Miners used to live here. This was once a densely populated area but since the mine became a real working
 hazard and some say it also got, well, unprofitable, people started to leave town, searching for a better life. Sadly,
 most of them ended up dead, as we later learned. Some were robbed and killed by raiders while others died of
 starvation and lack of medical supplies... Either way, a horrible way to end up in the wasteland.}
{136}{}{Indeed, thanks for the story.}
#sneak successful, after 121, instead 123
{137}{}{[Surprised.] I'll be damned. Either you have some serious skills or a stealth boy to waste. I'm impressed. You
 see, I am tracking these beasts as part of a research project Jerry asked me to do. That is to track down the individuals,
 find their movement patterns across this area and locate their nest. They have come too close to our homes to be
 ignored any longer. We need a permanent solution. And we'll need it fast, before they come in numbers we can't handle
 anymore.}
