How stupid is that? Fortunately, there are some people who understand that you can accomplish something in this cursed world only by the power of a weapon. They call themselves "Steel law". With good old expansionism, we could capture enough prisoners to significantly increase our production and military capacities! So it goes.

Good kid, except a little hot-headed... }
