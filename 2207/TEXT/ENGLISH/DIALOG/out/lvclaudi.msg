{20}{}{[她凝视着你]我知道这一定会在某个时候发生，但没有人相信我。今天是克劳迪娅・霍顿的最后一天。现在波士顿麦肯锡对我的永恒追求结束了。很快我就要和我丈夫团聚了。}

{110}{}{[克劳迪娅明显变得紧张起来，藏着眼睛]不，不，我没有从任何人那里拿走任何东西。。。}
### {111}{012}{I know you have the book. Someone witnessed you stashing it.}
{111}{012}{我知道你有那本书。有人看到你把它藏起来了。}
### {112}{010}{Huh. Okay. Another question then. [She is definitely not telling you something]}
{112}{010}{嗯。可以那又是一个问题。[她肯定没有告诉你什么]}

### {120}{}{Alright then. I admit I took the book from Ludwig. But I hid it very well and you will never find it! And I'll deny everything if you tell someone!}
{120}{}{好吧。我承认我从路德维希那里拿走了这本书。但我把它藏得很好，你永远找不到它！如果你告诉别人，我会否认一切！}
### {121}{013}{Why do you even need it for? Ludwig can't continue his work without it.}
{121}{013}{你为什么需要它？没有它，路德维希就无法继续他的工作。}

### {130}{}{[Claudia looks around and whispers] I am going to make a death ray and destroy all McKinseys!}
{130}{}{[克劳迪娅环顾四周，低声说道]我要制造一条死亡射线，摧毁所有的麦金西人！}
### {131}{014}{Claudia, you don't understand a thing in wave science. It'll take you years to develop a functional death ray. Ludwig, on the other hand, is going to make one already! I could take the book back to him - and then ask him to give the first assembled weapon to you. What do you think?}
{131}{014}{克劳迪娅，你对波动科学一无所知。你需要几年时间才能研制出一种功能性的死亡射线。另一方面，路德维希已经准备好了！我可以把书还给他，然后让他把第一件组装好的武器给你。你怎么看？}
### {132}{015}{Maybe I could buy it from you?}
{132}{015}{也许我可以从你那里买？}

### {140}{}{Hmm, maybe you're right... I tried to figure out what to do, but unsuccessfully. Return the book to Ludwig, tell him to give me the death ray as soon as he finishes!}
{140}{}{嗯，也许你是对的。。。我试着想办法，但没有成功。把书还给路德维希，告诉他一写完就给我死亡射线！}
### {141}{010}{Okay. I want to ask something else.}
{141}{010}{可以我想问别的问题。}
### {142}{999}{As soon as he makes a death ray, you'll get it. I'll go give him the book.}
{142}{999}{只要他发出死亡射线，你就会得到它。我去把书给他。}

### {150}{}{[Claudia thinks] I'm not interested in batteries. But if you could get something other for me, I would gladly return the book. I like the Spot-Up soda very much, I always want more - even dream of it at night. Bring me 20 bottles and the book is yours. I can't understand anything in it anyway.}
{150}{}{[克劳迪娅认为]我对电池不感兴趣。但如果你能给我买点别的东西，我很乐意把书还给你。我非常喜欢Spot Up苏打水，我总是想要更多――甚至晚上做梦都想喝。给我20瓶，这本书就是你的了。无论如何，我什么都听不懂。}
### {151}{016}{I have 20 bottles of Spot-Up with me. Ready to trade them for a science book.}

### {160}{}{[Claudia hands you the book, grabs the soda, opens one bottle right away, and starts gulping the drink.] }
{160}{}{[克劳迪娅递给你书，抓起苏打水，马上打开一瓶，开始大口喝下去。]}
### {161}{999}{...Okay, I'll go return the book then.}
{161}{999}{…好的，那我就去还书。}

### {170}{}{What do you want to know about this maniac, who is haunting our family and killed my husband Peter?}
{170}{}{关于这个疯子，你想知道什么？他一直困扰着我们家，杀死了我的丈夫彼得？}
### {171}{018}{I know what Boston did to Peter. I got angry and beat Boston senseless. Now peter is avenged and Boston won't be haunting Hortons anymore.}
{171}{018}{我知道波士顿对彼得做了什么。我生气了，把波士顿打晕了。现在彼得报了仇，波士顿不会再纠缠霍顿了。}
### {172}{019}{I talked to Boston, he is very sorry about what happened to Peter. He wants you to forgive him.}
{172}{019}{我和波士顿谈过了，他对彼得的遭遇感到非常抱歉。他希望你原谅他。}
### {173}{021}{I talked to Emily Dunton. She wants to organize a commemorative evening dedicated to your husband. After that, Boston will leave your family alone.}
{173}{021}{我和艾米丽・邓顿谈过了。她想组织一个纪念你丈夫的晚会。之后，波士顿将让你的家人独处。}
### {174}{010}{You are right, nothing to talk about. I want to ask something else.}
{174}{010}{你是对的，没什么好说的。我想问别的问题。}

### {180}{}{At last, justice was served! So it was you, a noble fighter for the rightful cause! Boston got what he deserved, I've seen the results of your doing. Now I won't be afraid for my life anymore. I'm glad Peter has been avenged.}
{180}{}{终于，正义得到了伸张！原来是你，一个为正当事业而战的高尚战士！波士顿得到了他应得的，我已经看到了你所做的结果。现在我再也不用担心我的生命了。我很高兴彼得被报了仇。}
### {181}{010}{Don't worry, you're safe. Now, to other questions. }
{181}{010}{别担心，你很安全。现在，谈谈其他问题。}

### {190}{}{I will forgive him when he leaves our family alone and stops harassing Hortons! }
{190}{}{当他离开我们家，不再骚扰霍顿时，我会原谅他的！}
### {191}{020}{He gave his word not to harm you and your family. Forgive him.}
{191}{020}{他保证不伤害你和你的家人。原谅他。}
### {192}{010}{Probably, he never will. I wanted to ask something else.}
{192}{010}{也许，他永远不会。我想问别的问题。}

### {200}{}{Okay, I'll forgive him. Lately, he is not following us as often as before. Probably he really is sorry about Peter's death.}
{200}{}{好吧，我会原谅他的。最近，他不像以前那样经常跟着我们。也许他真的对彼得的死感到抱歉。}
### {201}{999}{Okay, I'll tell Boston that you forgave him.}
{201}{999}{好吧，我会告诉波士顿你原谅了他。}

### {210}{}{I'm so happy! My husband will finally get the honors he deserved! And Boston will stop harassing Hortons. I would be glad to participate!}
{210}{}{我太高兴了！我丈夫最终会得到他应得的荣誉！波士顿将停止骚扰霍顿。我很乐意参加！}
### {211}{999}{Good. I'm sure Peter is worthy of it. I'll go tell everyone.}
{211}{999}{好的我相信彼得配得上。我去告诉大家。}

### {220}{}{Boston McKinsey wants to destroy Hortons! He killed my husband Peter in cold blood! On a meeting, in front of everyone! And he got away with it!}
{220}{}{波士顿麦肯锡想要摧毁霍顿！他冷血地杀死了我丈夫彼得！在会议上，当着大家的面！他侥幸逃脱！}
### {221}{023}{Maybe it was an accident?}
{221}{023}{也许是意外？}
### {222}{024}{How exactly did he kill Peter?}
{222}{024}{他究竟是怎么杀了彼得的？}

### {230}{}{[Claudia angrily clenches her fists] Boston makes a clown out of himself and everybody believes it. In reality, under this mask of stupidity hides a dangerous murderer, who wants to take out all our family! No one listens to me, but I know the truth! I stalk him all the time and foil his plans.}
{230}{}{[克劳迪娅愤怒地握紧拳头]波士顿把自己变成了小丑，每个人都相信这一点。事实上，在这个愚蠢的面具下隐藏着一个危险的杀人犯，他想干掉我们全家！没有人听我的，但我知道真相！我一直跟踪他，阻挠他的计划。}
### {231}{024}{How did Peter die?}
{231}{024}{彼得是怎么死的？}
### {232}{010}{I want to ask another question.}
{232}{010}{我想再问一个问题。}

### {240}{}{They were arguing at the meeting about changes to the Constitution. Boston made it look like he had lost control and pushed Peter hard. And he did it so precisely that Peter died!}
{240}{}{他们在会上争论修改宪法的问题。波士顿队让人觉得他失去了控制，狠狠地推了彼得一把。他做得如此精确，以致于彼得死了！}
### {241}{023}{Looks like an accident to me.}
{241}{023}{在我看来像是一场意外。}
### {242}{010}{Let me ask something else.}
{242}{010}{让我再问一个问题。}

### {250}{}{Inhabitants of Livos are the descendants of great people. It is us, who destined to revive the civilization, spreading the laws of a New World. These laws are the greatest achievement of our society. They are reflected in the Constitution of 15 rights. We will define new rules of living. For example, according to paragraph 2 of the Constitution, "Every inhabitant of New World has the right to breathe (and also, to cough and sneeze) the air of the New World, without needing the permission from other inhabitants of New World". This is going to blow the minds of humanity, leading us towards the great future!}
{250}{}{利沃斯的居民是伟人的后裔。正是我们，注定要复兴文明，传播新世界的法律。这些法律是我们社会最伟大的成就。《宪法》规定了15项权利。我们将定义新的生活规则。例如，根据《宪法》第2款，“新世界的每一位居民都有权呼吸（以及咳嗽和打喷嚏）新世界的空气，而无需获得新世界其他居民的许可”。这将震撼人类的心灵，带领我们走向伟大的未来！}
### {251}{010}{Yes, this looks important. Let me ask something else.}
{251}{010}{是的，这看起来很重要。让我再问一个问题。}

### {260}{}{The most important family in Livos is us, Hortons. Our ancestors were landlords and real estate owners, and my brother Ashton is the rightful successor of the rights to own this whole place. We only let other families live here because we are very kind. Ashton is the only one who can repair the vital equipment. If not for him, everything would break down here. Livos would fall into decline without Hortons. Schweins, McKinseys, and Duntons are busy with petty things and do nothing important.}
{260}{}{利沃斯最重要的家族是我们霍顿。我们的祖先是地主和房地产所有者，我的兄弟阿什顿是拥有整个地方权利的合法继承人。我们只让其他家庭住在这里，因为我们非常善良。阿什顿是唯一一个可以修理这些重要设备的人。如果没有他，这里的一切都会崩溃。如果没有霍顿，利沃斯就会衰落。Schweins、McKinseys和Duntons忙于琐碎的事情，不做任何重要的事情。}
### {261}{010}{I see, Hortons are really important for the well-being of Livos. Let's move to other questions.}
{261}{010}{我明白了，霍顿对利沃斯的健康真的很重要。让我们转到其他问题。}
