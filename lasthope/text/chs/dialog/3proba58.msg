{100}{}{Greetings, stranger. I'm Colin the farmer. Want to buy some of my brahmin? Fresh stock right out of Farmers
 Town?}
{101}{}{I'm interested in getting some information.}
{102}{}{No, thanks.}
#information...
{103}{}{Sure, how can this fella help you?}
{104}{}{What do you do here?}
{105}{}{What can you tell me about Farmers Town?}
{106}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
#do here...
{107}{}{Well, being a farmer, I tend to my brahmin and sell them to make some money. Let me tell you, it's so hard
 these days to earn even a modest living. Mantis raids, cattle thieves... I must work all day and night, and even then I
 can't manage to cover the losses. My brahmin headcount keeps going down, can't get any worse than this...}
{108}{}{What's this about mantis raids?}
{109}{}{Who are these thieves?}
{110}{}{I'm afraid it can... It really is a hard life, wasteland and all... Let me change the subject.}
#mantis...
{111}{}{Those small bastards like to come out of their holes and tunnels and prowl around, mostly during night time.
 A couple of times they left my cowshed almost empty. I tried everything to drive them off, but only managed to get
 attacked and earn myself some scars. Now it serves as a reminder to use my head, not my shovel...}
{112}{}{I'm sure you'll do that. Tell me something...}
#thieves...
{113}{}{Hm... I'm not sure. I thought they were some tribals, but they were armed with clubs and guns. Nothing I
 could do.}
{114}{}{I'm sorry. Can you answer me something...}
#about farmers town...
{115}{}{It's a small community east from here. I used to live there, at least a year, before I moved along with my
 business. Lots of trouble for such a small place. No traffic, just a few locals and a bunch of gun-obsessed ruffians. Not
 very pleasant... Some would say it's heading for lawlessness and violence.}
{116}{}{It can't be that bad. Oh well, let me ask you something else.}
#
{117}{}{Just say it.}
#
{118}{}{No thanks. But I have some good news regarding the mantis raids...}
#
{119}{}{I heard what happened. That's the best damn news so far. With those big bugs dropping in numbers I
 may actually earn something for a living after all. I think I know how to repay you. [Searches his bag and
 pulls out a dusty old map.] Here it is. This map will help you as much as it has helped me during my traveling days. It
 holds most if not all safe paths I could find in the surrounding areas.}
{120}{}{Thanks. Yes indeed, this could be useful.}
#do here after mantis destroyed...
{121}{}{Well, being a farmer, I breed brahmin and sell them to make some money. Let me tell you, it's so hard these
 days to earn even a modest living. But with those mantis raids gone, I can breathe a little easier. Thankfully, things
 are closer to normal than they used to be, and it shows. Still, there's more work to be done...}
{122}{}{I'm sure about that. I had something else on my mind...}
#
{123}{}{Nice to see you again. Interested in buying some of my brahmin?}
#
{124}{}{Actually there's nothing I wanted to ask you. I'm off.}
#
{125}{}{Have you heard anything about patrols from that prison up north?}
#
{126}{}{Yes, I think I've heard a thing or two. And, of course, the sheriff told me about the "situation" here. Why are
 you asking?}
{127}{}{Have you seen anyone coming from there?}
{128}{}{I just want you to be careful, that's all.}
#coming...
{129}{}{Anyone, like who? You mean patrols? I've seen them just outside the town, that's all I know.}
{130}{}{Sure, nevermind then.}
#dude wearing prison armor...
{131}{}{Hey, I ain't talking to you.}
{132}{}{Just leave me be.}
{133}{}{What? Have I done something wrong?}
{134}{}{You aren't here to take me away, are you?}
#
{135}{}{Actually, I don't have time to talk right now.}
#
{136}{}{What about those thieves...}
{137}{}{You said something about mantis raids...}
