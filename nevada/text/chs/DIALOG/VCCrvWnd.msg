#{100}{}{Bobby the caravan merchant!}
{100}{}{商队商人鲍比！}
#{101}{}{This is the same caravaneer that was beaten in the Wind of War! He's here!}
{101}{}{这就是在战风中被打败的商队队员！他来了！}
#{105}{}{Hey, friend! Would you buy a beer for the working man?}
{105}{}{嘿，朋友！你能给工人买杯啤酒吗？}
#{110}{}{Buddy, I'm glad to see you! How is it going?}
{110}{}{伙计，很高兴见到你！过得如何？}
#{111}{}{Things are moving... Well, I think so. And how are you? Did you come back to normal after the Wind of War?}
{111}{}{一切都在改变...嗯，我想是的。你好吗？战风过后你恢复正常了吗？}
#{112}{}{[Waves his hand] Everything is fine! I won't set a foot in the Wind ever again. I will go with the caravans plying between Salt Lake and Vegas, as for the Wind - I won't make a single step in its direction! By the way, want to nibble a bit? [holds out a handful of little nuts]}
{112}{}{[挥挥手]一切都很好！我再也不会踏入风口浪尖了。我会和穿梭在盐湖城和维加斯之间的商队一起去，至于风，我不会朝着它的方向走一步！顺便问一下，想咬一口吗？[伸出一把小坚果]}
#{113}{}{What is this?}
{113}{}{这是什么？}
#{114}{}{Vocas. The guys just returned from Salt Lake. You know they've got the great salt lake out there, where mutated water lily grows. It won't grow anywhere else. Two times a year it blooms and gives the nuts. Nibble on it, you won't regret. The taste is bitter, but they help to excrete all sorts of crap out of your body. Useful stuff, in short.}
{114}{}{人声。他们刚从盐湖城回来。你知道那里有大盐湖，变异的睡莲生长在那里。它不会在其他地方生长。它一年开花两次，结果开花了。咬一口，你就不会后悔了。味道是苦的，但是它们有助于排出你身体里的各种垃圾。总之，有用的东西。}
#{115}{}{Well, thank you. But where is Salt Lake?}
{115}{}{好吧，谢谢你。但盐湖在哪里？}
#{116}{}{Well, thank you. Was happy to see you.}
{116}{}{好吧，谢谢你。很高兴见到你。}
#{117}{}{What a nonsense. And no thanks whatsoever.}
{117}{}{真是胡说八道。不用谢。}
#{118}{}{This is in the North. About as far as New Reno from here. Let me show it on your map.}
{118}{}{这是在北方。从这里到新雷诺。让我在你的地图上看看。}
#{119}{}{Thanks. Maybe I'd wind up there someday.}
{119}{}{谢谢。也许有一天我会去那里。}
#{120}{}{If you gonna get there make sure to have clean water with you in the road, there is a serious problem with it in the city. When you get to the outskirts, you'd immediately sense the smell of rot and moisture.}
{120}{}{如果你要去那里，确保路上有干净的水，城市里的水有严重的问题。当你到了郊区，你会立刻感觉到腐烂和潮湿的气味。}
#{121}{}{Noted. Bye.}
{121}{}{注意。再见。}
#{122}{}{Hello there, friend!}
{122}{}{你好，朋友！}
#{123}{}{Are you going to hang around there forever? What are your plans?}
{123}{}{你打算永远在那里呆着吗？你有什么计划？}
#{124}{}{Do you know anything about the caravans transporting dangerous products? For example, drugs?}
{124}{}{你知道运输危险品的商队吗？比如，毒品？}
#{125}{}{Hello. And bye.}
{125}{}{你好。再见。}
#{126}{}{Well, what's with the plans? I have to work! Have to go with the caravan to Salt Lake. Usually I get enough in one trip to live quietly in Vegas for a couple of weeks. What other plans could a simple caravan merchant have?! That's how it is.}
{126}{}{嗯，计划是怎么回事？我得工作！我得跟大篷车去盐湖城。通常我一次旅行就够在维加斯安静地住上几个星期了。一个简单的商队商人还能有什么计划？！事情就是这样。}
#{127}{}{Nevermind.}
{127}{}{没有关系。}
#{128}{}{I stay away from those things. I don't like all this.}
{128}{}{我远离那些东西。我不喜欢这些。}
#{129}{}{But you still know something, right?}
{129}{}{但你还是知道些什么，对吧？}
#{130}{}{Damn it! Man, I'm telling you, stay away from all this dope!}
{130}{}{该死的！伙计，我告诉你，离这些毒品远点！}
#{131}{}{But I really need to know!}
{131}{}{但我真的需要知道！}
#{132}{}{No, friend, you *don't* need to know.}
{132}{}{不，朋友，你不需要知道。}
#{133}{}{Tell me, bitch! Tell me or I'll *force* you!}
{133}{}{告诉我，婊子！告诉我，否则我就逼你！}
#{134}{}{Friend, I'm interfering not just for the sake of it. It's not just about me, you see... Nothing personal.}
{134}{}{朋友，我干涉不仅仅是为了它。不仅仅是我，你看...没什么私事。}
#{135}{}{You won't tell? Okay, then I'll have to leave.}
{135}{}{你不说？好吧，那我得走了。}
#{136}{}{Don't get mad, chill! I... Okay. I will tell you, since you need it so much. But keep in mind, if anything happens, I'm not to blame!}
{136}{}{别生气，冷静！一、 ...可以。我会告诉你的，因为你太需要它了。但请记住，如果发生什么事，我不该受责备！}
#{137}{}{You'll tell me in *any* case! Understand!?}
{137}{}{不管怎样，你都要告诉我！明白吗！？}
#{138}{}{You should have started from this! Tell me.}
{138}{}{你应该从这个开始！告诉我。}
#{139}{}{Ahem... [lowers his voice] We call it the "Black Caravan". It is a few lads, they don't contact with the outsiders. They stay in the backyard behind this building, push off their stuff to someone, quietly, in silence, and then as quietly go away at night. We're doing our best to avoid them, you never know what might happen...}
{139}{}{啊哼...我们称之为“黑商队”。是几个小伙子，他们不和外人接触。他们呆在这幢楼后面的后院里，把东西推给别人，静静地，静静地，然后在晚上悄悄地离开。我们正在尽力避免他们，你永远不知道会发生什么...}
#{140}{}{So, they may be nearby? Got it.}
{140}{}{那么，他们可能就在附近？知道了。}
#{141}{}{Yeah, and yet again - I didn't tell you this. Okay?}
{141}{}{是啊，再说一遍-我没告诉你。可以？}
#{142}{}{We'll see about that.}
{142}{}{我们拭目以待。}
#{143}{}{Don't worry, pal.}
{143}{}{别担心，伙计。}
#{144}{}{No, I don't understand. And don't want to understand.}
{144}{}{不，我不明白。我不想理解。}
#{145}{}{Nevermind.}
{145}{}{没有关系。}
#{1105}{}{Hey, friend! Would you buy a beer for the working man?}
{1105}{}{嘿，朋友！你能给工人买杯啤酒吗？}
#{1110}{}{Friend, I'm glad to see you! How is it going?}
{1110}{}{朋友，很高兴见到你！过得如何？}
#{1116}{}{Well, thank you. Was happy to see you.}
{1116}{}{好吧，谢谢你。很高兴见到你。}
#{1122}{}{Hello there, friend!}
{1122}{}{你好，朋友！}
#{1130}{}{Damn it! Girl, I'm telling you, stay away from all this dope!}
{1130}{}{该死的！女孩，我告诉你，远离这些毒品！}
#{1132}{}{No, friend, you *don't* need to know.}
{1132}{}{不，朋友，你不需要知道。}
