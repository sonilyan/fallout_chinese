#{100}{}{You see a traveler.}
{100}{}{你看到一个旅行者。 -- You see a traveler.}
#{101}{}{You see a spy.}
{101}{}{你看到一个间谍。 -- You see a spy.}
#{102}{}{You see an ordinary looking traveler. It is difficult to suspect him in being a spy or something like it.}
{102}{}{你看到一个长相普通的旅行者。很难怀疑他是间谍之类的。 -- You see an ordinary looking traveler. It is difficult to suspect him in being a spy or something like it.}
#{104}{}{I've already paid you. And there is nothing to talk about.}
{104}{}{我已经付钱给你了。没什么好谈的。 -- I've already paid you. And there is nothing to talk about.}
#{110}{}{Looking for something, wanderer? Never mind, I was just asking.}
{110}{}{在找什么吗，流浪者？没关系，我只是问问。 -- Looking for something, wanderer? Never mind, I was just asking.}
#{111}{}{Yes. Were there any bikers passing by?}
{111}{}{对。有骑车人经过吗？ -- Yes. Were there any bikers passing by?}
#{112}{}{So you have a trained eye on recognizing my kind?}
{112}{}{所以你有一双训练有素的眼睛来识别我的同类？ -- So you have a trained eye on recognizing my kind?}
#{113}{}{I wonder what are *you* doing here?}
{113}{}{我想知道你在这里干什么？ -- I wonder what are *you* doing here?}
#{114}{}{Bye.}
{114}{}{再见。 -- Bye.}
#{115}{}{Bikers? I've heard about them, but have not seen them personally. If you believe the rumors, these guys would be especially out of place here. I don't think that the local military men would be friendly to marauders.}
{115}{}{摩托车手？我听说过他们，但没有亲眼见过。如果你相信谣言，这些家伙在这里会特别不合适。我不认为当地的军人会对劫掠者友好。 -- Bikers? I've heard about them, but have not seen them personally. If you believe the rumors, these guys would be especially out of place here. I don't think that the local military men would be friendly to marauders.}
#{116}{}{Marauders?}
{116}{}{劫掠者？ -- Marauders?}
#{117}{}{Well, I heard that the bikers looted most of their gear and cool guns from military bases. Which is quite logical. Only it is unlikely, that local people will look at it with indifference. They think that all the property of military bases should belong to them by the birthright. Because their ancestors were from these places.}
{117}{}{嗯，我听说骑自行车的人从军事基地抢走了大部分装备和冷枪。这很符合逻辑。只是当地人不太可能漠不关心。他们认为根据与生俱来的权利，军事基地的所有财产都应该属于他们。因为他们的祖先来自这些地方。 -- Well, I heard that the bikers looted most of their gear and cool guns from military bases. Which is quite logical. Only it is unlikely, that local people will look at it with indifference. They think that all the property of military bases should belong to them by the birthright.

#{118}{}{I see you know the history of the local population. Where such awareness comes from?}
{118}{}{我知道你知道当地居民的历史。这种意识从何而来？ -- I see you know the history of the local population. Where such awareness comes from?}
#{119}{}{Well... Rumors slip by little from different places. Nevermind.}
{119}{}{好。。。谣言从不同的地方传来。没有关系。 -- Well... Rumors slip by little from different places. Nevermind.}
#{120}{}{I don't think you're here just for the sake of rumors.}
{120}{}{我不认为你来这里只是为了谣言。 -- I don't think you're here just for the sake of rumors.}
#{121}{}{I needed a place to sleep. I'm just a traveler, nothing special.}
{121}{}{我需要一个地方睡觉。我只是个旅行者，没什么特别的。 -- I needed a place to sleep. I'm just a traveler, nothing special.}
#{122}{}{Well, well. Usually no one leaves their homes for no reason. I know it well, believe me.}
{122}{}{好吧，好吧。通常没有人会无缘无故离开家。我很清楚，相信我。 -- Well, well. Usually no one leaves their homes for no reason. I know it well, believe me.}
#{123}{}{Heh. True. I have my reasons... But I'd still like to know what a person like you is doing in this troubled place?}
{123}{}{嘿。是的。我有我的理由。。。但我还是想知道像你这样的人在这个麻烦的地方干什么？ -- Heh. True. I have my reasons... But I'd still like to know what a person like you is doing in this troubled place?}
#{124}{}{Well, not that... You know, you don't cause any special mistrust. It would be possible to do joint business with you.}
{124}{}{嗯，不是那个。。。你知道，你不会引起任何特别的不信任。有可能和你们做联合生意。 -- Well, not that... You know, you don't cause any special mistrust. It would be possible to do joint business with you.}
#{125}{}{My interests to this place are solely temporary. My goal is located somewhere far away from here. I don't even know where.}
{125}{}{我对这个地方的兴趣只是暂时的。我的目标离这儿很远。我都不知道在哪里。 -- My interests to this place are solely temporary. My goal is located somewhere far away from here. I don't even know where.}
#{126}{}{Business? Like what?}
{126}{}{生意？像什么？ -- Business? Like what?}
#{127}{}{Oh, brother-in-the-Wasteland? This is encouraging... You know, you do not cause any special mistrust. It would be possible to do joint business with you.}
{127}{}{哦，荒地里的兄弟？这是令人鼓舞的。。。你知道，你不会引起任何特别的不信任。有可能和你们做联合生意。 -- Oh, brother-in-the-Wasteland? This is encouraging... You know, you do not cause any special mistrust. It would be possible to do joint business with you.}
#{128}{}{Don't rush, I want to know more about you. What can you say about this place?}
{128}{}{别着急，我想多了解你。关于这个地方你能说些什么？ -- Don't rush, I want to know more about you. What can you say about this place?}
#{129}{}{The lousy dump with lousy residents. I wouldn't linger here for long.}
{129}{}{肮脏的垃圾场和肮脏的居民。我不会在这里逗留太久。 -- The lousy dump with lousy residents. I wouldn't linger here for long.}

{130}{}{有些东西告诉我，他们有一个崇高的目标，在里面的某个地方。但也许现在是时候与他们作对了。 -- Something tells me that they have a noble goal, somewhere inside. But perhaps now the time is working against them.}
#{131}{}{Hey, I'm not going to gossip with you! Let's finish this.}
{131}{}{嘿，我不会跟你闲聊的！让我们完成这个。 -- Hey, I'm not going to gossip with you! Let's finish this.}
#{132}{}{Then I'll ask maybe a strange question. But tell me: stealing from the thief - is that a fair act?}
{132}{}{然后我会问一个奇怪的问题。但是告诉我：从小偷那里偷东西-这是公平的行为吗？ -- Then I'll ask maybe a strange question. But tell me: stealing from the thief - is that a fair act?}
#{133}{}{I don't care whose pockets get cleaned out. I don't ask them.}
{133}{}{我不管谁的口袋被洗干净。我没有问他们。 -- I don't care whose pockets get cleaned out. I don't ask them.}
#{134}{}{But don't the residents of the Wind of War offer their patronage and protection in exchange for resources? Then they're not thieves.}
{134}{}{但是，难道战争之风的居民不提供他们的庇护和保护，以换取资源吗？那他们就不是小偷了。 -- But don't the residents of the Wind of War offer their patronage and protection in exchange for resources? Then they're not thieves.}
#{135}{}{Theft is a rotten business. You can cover it up, but it still stinks.}
{135}{}{偷窃是一件糟糕的事。你可以掩盖它，但它还是很臭。 -- Theft is a rotten business. You can cover it up, but it still stinks.}
#{136}{}{Finish up this haggle. I see you have a grudge against the residents of the Wind. Make it simple, just say what do you need?}
{136}{}{结束这场讨价还价。我看你对风中的居民怀恨在心。简单点，说你需要什么？ -- Finish up this haggle. I see you have a grudge against the residents of the Wind. Make it simple, just say what do you need?}

{140}{}{你的态度让我厌烦！我不在乎你的野心，我只关心个人利益。告诉我你需要什么，你要付多少钱-那我就进去了。 -- You bored me with your attitude! I don't care about your ambitions, I'm only interested in personal gain. Tell me what you need and how much you will pay for it - then I'm in.}
#{141}{}{Oh, take it easy! However... There's truth in your words. After all, who else but me needs my ambitions?}
{141}{}{哦，别紧张！然而。。。你的话是真的。毕竟，除了我还有谁需要我的雄心壮志？ -- Oh, take it easy! However... There's truth in your words. After all, who else but me needs my ambitions?}

#{150}{}{Does it really matter to you? As for me, I don't care why that cuss would need them. Yes, you've guessed correctly, I'm a mercenary myself.

{150}{}{这对你真的重要吗？至于我，我不在乎那混蛋为什么需要他们。是的，你猜对了，我自己也是个雇佣军。但别问我顾客的事-我对他还是一无所知。我们只是平分费用，仅此而已。虽然这并不意味着我没有野心。 -- Does it really matter to you? As for me, I don't care why that cuss would need them.

{152}{}{除了贪婪，你还追求什么？ -- Which other interests you pursue, besides greed?}
#{153}{}{I HATE this town! I once lived in a small settlement not far from here. The military offered protection in exchange for resources. But when the slavers came, a group of "protectors" turned out to be too far to help. Since then, I just want to spite these bastards.}
{153}{}{我讨厌这个城市！我曾经住在离这里不远的一个小定居点里。军方提供保护以换取资源。但当奴隶主来了，一群“保护者”却远远帮不上忙。从那以后，我只想对这些混蛋不屑一顾。 -- I HATE this town! I once lived in a small settlement not far from here.

#{156}{}{Very well. I repeat our plan just in case. You need to get into the room with the computer in the headquarters.

{156}{}{很好。我重复我们的计划以防万一。你需要带着总部的电脑进入房间。这项任务本身并不难――无线电操作员忙于估计，几乎从不分心，而且放着电脑的房间常常空无一人。问题是如何获取信息而不泄露自己。这就是你的技能和智慧派上用场的地方。 -- Very well. I repeat our plan just in case.
