#{100}{}{You see a ghoul.}
{100}{}{你看到一个僵尸。}
#{150}{}{You see Scott.}
{150}{}{你看到斯科特了。}
#{200}{}{You see a glowing ghoul, his expression doesn't evoke trust. But the falling-off flesh might have something to do with it.}
{200}{}{你看到一个容光焕发的僵尸，他的表情无法唤起信任。但掉下来的肉可能与此有关。}
#{250}{}{You see Scott. The fact that this ghoul is in charge of the reactor doesn't add to your feeling of security.}
{250}{}{你看到斯科特了。这个僵尸掌管反应堆的事实并不能增加你的安全感。}
#{300}{}{They're asking us to do the impossible again? I can't bloody change the laws of physics!}
{300}{}{他们要我们再做不可能的事？我不能改变物理定律！}
#{301}{}{Delegation? Sorry we didn't roll out the red carpet.}
{301}{}{代表团？抱歉，我们没有走红地毯。}
#{302}{}{We've got a visitor, act like you're working!}
{302}{}{我们有客人，假装你在工作！}
#{303}{}{Look what the radroach dragged in.}
{303}{}{看看那只蟑螂拖进来的是什么。}
#{304}{}{Too much light for you here? Ha, ha.}
{304}{}{这里光线太多了？哈，哈。}
#{305}{}{Hey, that wasn't funny!}
{305}{}{嘿，一点都不好笑！}
#{400}{}{I'm too old for this shit... In fact, I've never been any good at it.}
{400}{}{我太老了，不能再这样了。。。事实上，我从来都不擅长。}
#{401}{}{I don't like violence, it's too painful.}
{401}{}{我不喜欢暴力，太痛苦了。}
#{402}{}{And this used to be quite a peaceful place.}
{402}{}{这曾经是一个非常宁静的地方。}
#{403}{}{Stupid orders.}
{403}{}{愚蠢的命令。}
#{500}{}{What are you bringing me? It's gotta be something important, if they're sending someone instead of just sending a message. Or maybe someone just can't use a computer?}
{500}{}{你带什么来？如果他们是在给别人发信息，而不是只发信息，那一定很重要。或者有人就是不会用电脑？}
#{501}{}{Who are you?}
{501}{}{你是谁？}
#{502}{}{Oogla.}
{502}{}{哎呀。}
#{550}{}{Who am I? I'm Scott, you could say I'm in charge of all this. Don't tell me you've just wandered in here by accident. Here into a guarded area.}
{550}{}{我是谁？我是斯科特，你可以说我负责这一切。别告诉我你只是偶然来的。这里是戒备区。}
#{551}{}{I have, in fact.}
{551}{}{事实上，我有。}
#{552}{}{I came here to check on you.}
{552}{}{我是来看看你的。}
#{600}{}{It's not that I wouldn't like to talk to someone new about what madness is going on up there, but my orders are clear. An unauthorized person in this area is an intruder and all intruders must be eliminated. It's a stupid regulation, I don't like it, but why am I telling you about it? I'm sure you're not gonna like it either.}
{600}{}{并不是说我不想和一个新来的人谈论那里到底发生了什么疯狂的事情，但我的命令很明确。该区域内未经授权的人员是入侵者，必须清除所有入侵者。这是个愚蠢的规定，我不喜欢，但我为什么要告诉你？我肯定你也不会喜欢的。}
#{601}{}{We'll see who ends up worse.}
{601}{}{我们看看谁会更糟。}
#{602}{}{I came here to check on you and you've just passed the first test. I'm glad you're following all orders despite your opinion of them.}
{602}{}{我是来检查你的，你刚刚通过了第一次考试。我很高兴你能听从所有的命令，尽管你对他们有意见。}

#{650}{}{Hey boys, this guy's here to check up on us, so pants down so we don't keep him waiting! [He yells at the other ghouls, but they continue doing their work, ignoring the joke.] What do you want to check out here? If something went wrong here, the guys up there would notice right away. Don't tell me someone's light bulb went out and they're blaming us.}
{650}{}{嘿，伙计们，这家伙是来检查我们的，所以穿上裤子别让他等了！[他对其他僵尸大喊大叫，但他们继续工作，无视这个笑话。]你想在这里查什么？如果这里出了问题，上面的人会马上注意到的。别告诉我有人的灯泡坏了，他们在责怪我们。}

#{655}{}{I'll have a look around and we'll see.}

#{700}{}{Hey, easy there. If anyone's going to take off their pants, it'll be in the presence of a lady doctor in an appropriate state of decomposition.}
{700}{}{嘿，别紧张。如果有人要脱裤子的话，一定要有女医生在场，处于适当的腐烂状态。}

#{704}{}{I'll have a look around and we'll see.}
{704}{}{我四处看看，等着瞧。}
#{750}{}{So do I have to kill you to prove I'm following orders, or should you just tell me what you want to check out here? If something went wrong here, the guys up there would notice right away. Just don't tell me someone's light bulb went out and they're blaming us.}
{750}{}{所以我必须杀了你来证明我在服从命令，还是你应该告诉我你想在这里查什么？如果这里出了问题，上面的人会马上注意到的。别告诉我有人的灯泡坏了，他们在责怪我们。}

#{754}{}{I'll have a look around and we'll see.}
{754}{}{我四处看看，等着瞧。}
#{800}{}{Yeah, if someone was looking for a deadly fireworks show in here, the easiest way would be to destroy the cooling device. We've got the 6002 version, it automatically provides cooling for the reactor, monitors temperature and regulates it accordingly. An amazing thing, there's no need to even check it, but without it... Without it there would be no cooling and without cooling, all we could say would be hasta la vista, baby. That's why it's properly locked up in the room next to the reactor behind the door that even I don't have the key for.}
{800}{}{是的，如果有人在这里找一场致命的焰火表演，最简单的方法就是摧毁冷却装置。我们有6002版本，它自动为反应堆提供冷却，监控温度并相应地调节。一件神奇的事情，甚至不需要检查它，但是没有它。。。没有它，就没有冷却，没有冷却，我们只能说，哈斯塔拉维斯塔，宝贝。这就是为什么它被关在门后反应堆旁边的房间里，连我都没有钥匙。}
#{801}{}{Or?}
{801}{}{或者？}
#{850}{}{Or they could destroy the reactor's central computer, but they wouldn't be able to get to it, of course. The only way they could damage it is if they got the maintenance robot to crash into it hard enough. But the robot is sufficiently secured so it doesn't even bump into anything. You could go ahead and try crashing it without worrying about heating things up between us.}
{850}{}{或者他们可以摧毁反应堆的中央计算机，但他们当然无法访问它。他们唯一能损坏它的方法就是让维修机器人撞得够狠。但是机器人有足够的安全性，所以它甚至不会撞到任何东西。你可以试着把它弄坏，而不用担心我们之间的事情会变得越来越激烈。}
#{851}{}{How come it isn't possible to reach the main computer?}
{851}{}{为什么连主计算机都联系不上呢？}
#{852}{}{I'm interested in something else.}
{852}{}{我对别的东西感兴趣。}
#{853}{}{I'll check it all.}
{853}{}{我会查清楚的。}
#{900}{}{Because it's in the reactor room. Its doors are sealed and even plastic explosives wouldn't make more than a dent in them. Everything inside is highly radioactive. You might find that strange, but the reactor's constructors didn't expect it would be run by some ghouls who don't really mind radiation and could easily service it manually.}
{900}{}{因为它在反应堆室里。它的门是密封的，即使是塑料炸药也只会在门上留下一个凹痕。里面的一切都是高放射性的。你可能会觉得奇怪，但反应堆的建设者没想到它会由一些僵尸操作，他们并不介意辐射，可以很容易地手动维修。}
#{901}{}{I'm interested in something else.}
{901}{}{我对别的东西感兴趣。}
#{902}{}{I'll check it all.}
{902}{}{我会查清楚的。}
#{950}{}{Well look at that, someone's finally taking an interest in the 4th floor's power supply? OK, I'll tell you. Some pretty big adjustments were carried out in that area. The guys working on it made all kinds of connections and to simplify and hasten their work, they connected most of the systems to two generators. These were originally the backup generators in case of power outages. Now they supply power for almost the whole floor. Should one of them stop working, half of Red 4 would be without power for several minutes until the power supply is automatically diverted from a different source. That's fine, if the guys up there want to play some erotic games, I'd join them right away, but I'm not sure if our smoothskin prisoners would be willing to join in.}
{950}{}{你看，终于有人对四楼的电源感兴趣了？好吧，我告诉你。在那个地区进行了一些相当大的调整。工作人员做了各种各样的连接，为了简化和加速他们的工作，他们把大部分系统连接到两台发电机上。这些原本是停电时的备用发电机。现在他们几乎为整层楼供电。如果其中一个停止工作，红色4的一半将停电几分钟，直到电源自动从另一个来源转移。没关系，如果上面的人想玩一些色情游戏，我会马上加入他们，但我不确定我们的光滑皮肤囚犯是否愿意加入。}
#{951}{}{I'm interested in something else.}
{951}{}{我对别的东西感兴趣。}
#{952}{}{Thanks for the info.}
{952}{}{谢谢你的信息。}
#{1000}{}{What are you babbling about? Every evening we throw wild parties, a lot of horny chicks come over and on our lucky days we get the Savior as a VIP.}
{1000}{}{你在胡说什么？每天晚上我们都会举办疯狂的派对，很多性感的小妞都会来，在我们幸运的日子里，我们得到了救世主作为贵宾。}

#{1002}{}{Great, I'll join you tonight, then.}
{1002}{}{太好了，那我今晚和你一起去。}
#{1050}{}{What do you think? Besides the fact that only a handful of people have access here, you know very well the glowing ones aren't really welcome among the others. Moreover, they think we're only good for keeping this place running, since everything runs automatically around here and things just need to be overseen.}
{1050}{}{你怎么认为？除此之外，只有少数人可以进入这里，你很清楚发光的人在其他人中并不受欢迎。此外，他们认为我们只适合保持这个地方的运转，因为这里的一切都是自动运转的，一切都需要监督。}

#{1055}{}{I've gotta go, goodbye.}

#{1100}{}{Most glowing ones have their bodies in the utmost possible state of decomposition, they're glad they're still moving. That's not my case, though, I'm still as fresh as a rosebud. I wouldn't mind running around outside catching the smoothskins, but try waylaying someone when they can see you from miles off. Well, I'm content, anyway, as long as they say the rebirth will be possible for us, too. We should even stop glowing then. I mean, it wouldn't be proper, being a smoothskin and still glowing like a street lamp.}
{1100}{}{大多数发光体的身体都处于最可能的分解状态，它们很高兴自己还在移动。不过，那不是我的情况，我还是像玫瑰花蕾一样新鲜。我不介意在外面跑来跑去，但是当有人能从几英里外看到你的时候，试着拦住他们。好吧，我很满足，不管怎样，只要他们说重生对我们来说也是可能的。我们甚至应该停止发光。我的意思是，这是不合适的，作为一个光滑的皮肤，仍然发光像路灯。}

{1151}{}{好吧，我们认真谈谈。}
#{1200}{}{Sure, we're all graduated nuclear physicists. The truth is I know a thing or two, I used to work in a nuclear plant before the war. I've also passed a few bits of wisdom around, like what to do when the radioactive waste gets into your underpants and so on, ha ha.}
{1200}{}{当然，我们都是毕业的核物理学家。事实上我只知道一两件事，战前我在核电站工作过。我也传递了一些智慧，比如放射性废物进入你的内裤时该怎么办等等，哈哈。}

#{1250}{}{The best moment of my life. Me and my girlfriend Lex, we used to have our favorite place, no people, beautiful view of the city. We used to lie in the grass - it was still green and fragrant back then. We were just in the middle of stuffin' the ole turkey when the ground shook. At first I thought "Damn, I gotta be really good!", but then everything exploded. An enormous blaze enveloped us, burning our bodies just as I came. The orgasm and pain combined into an amazing unimaginable ecstasy. It was perfect. I doubt the rebirth will be anywhere near that experience.}
{1250}{}{我生命中最美好的时刻。我和我的女朋友莱克斯，我们曾经有我们最喜欢的地方，没有人，美丽的城市景色。我们过去常躺在草地上，那时候草地还是绿的，香的。我们正在往火鸡里塞东西，突然地震动了。一开始我想“该死，我一定要做得很好！”但后来一切都爆炸了。一场大火包围了我们，就在我来的时候烧着了我们的身体。高潮和疼痛结合成一种不可思议的狂喜。太完美了。我怀疑重生会不会接近那种经历。}
#{1251}{}{What about Lex?}
{1251}{}{莱克斯呢？}
#{1300}{}{She died during the thing, I'm not sure if it was from too much satisfaction or pain. But she didn't miss much, it wasn't much good afterwards. Irradiated ash was falling everywhere, people on the streets were dying in agony or were killing each other, if they were still up to it.}
{1300}{}{她在那件事中死了，我不确定是因为太满足还是太痛苦。但她没有错过太多，后来也不怎么好。被辐射的火山灰到处飘落，街上的人们痛苦地死去，或者互相残杀，如果他们还坚持的话。}

{1304}{}{我要走了。}
#{1350}{}{I'd like to think people take our work seriously and as a result, the access to the reactor is restricted.

I guess they're sitting on a golden egg or something.}
{1350}{}{我想人们会认真对待我们的工作，因此，进入反应堆的通道受到限制。但真正的原因是布莱恩和他的人守护着我们身边非常罕见的东西。这对每个人来说都是绝密的。救世主的命令。我猜他们坐在金蛋上什么的。}
