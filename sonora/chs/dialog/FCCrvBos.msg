### {212}{}{He's not here. Bye.}
{212}{}{他不在。再见}
### {213}{}{I don't think we can do business with you. We only work with the administration of this mine.}
{213}{}{我认为我们不能和你做生意。我们只与该矿的管理部门合作。}
### {214}{}{And what are you doing?}
{214}{}{你在干什么？}
### {215}{}{As a rule, we transport heavy loads. And what?}

#Questions
### {220}{}{Go ahead. What's on your mind?}
{220}{}{着手你在想什么？}

### {221}{}{Where is your caravan route?}
{221}{}{你的房车路线在哪里？}
### {222}{}{Our target is Phoenix City in the south. On the way, we look into small parking lots along Route 17 and pass by San Brahmin.}
{222}{}{我们的目标是南方的凤凰城。在路上，我们沿着17号公路进入小停车场，经过圣婆罗门。}
### {223}{}{Tell me about San Brahmin.}
{223}{}{告诉我关于圣婆罗门的事。}
### {224}{}{A large town on the way to Phoenix. The locals are mainly engaged in cattle breeding and therefore see us outsiders as only Brahmin buyers.}
{224}{}{去凤凰城的路上的一个大城镇。当地人主要从事养牛，因此把我们这些外来者视为婆罗门的唯一买家。}
### {225}{}{Tell me about Phoenix.}
{225}{}{告诉我关于凤凰城的事。}
### {226}{}{The biggest city I know of. You'll find everything there that you can find in the Wastelands, but you have to be careful. It's not safe in the city, even after the fire worshippers seized power there.}
{226}{}{我所知道的最大的城市。你会在荒原上找到你能找到的一切，但你必须小心。这座城市并不安全，即使在拜火者夺取政权之后也是如此。}
### {227}{}{The direction is south. But why would I share with you the subtleties of my craft?}
{227}{}{方向是南方。但我为什么要和你分享我技艺的精妙之处呢？}
### {228}{}{Fire worshippers?}
{228}{}{火崇拜者？}
### {229}{}{Strange guys. They worship pre-war atomic energy - that's all I understand. There are too many words to delve into. But they don't sit there idle either - it's with them that Phoenix has become a real city.}
{229}{}{奇怪的家伙。他们崇拜战前的原子能――这就是我所理解的。有太多的话要深究。但他们也不会无所事事――正是有了他们，凤凰城才成为一座真正的城市。}

### {230}{}{What kind of cargo are you transporting?}
{230}{}{你在运输什么样的货物？}
### {231}{}{The uranium that is mined here in this mine.}
{231}{}{在这个矿井里开采的铀。}
### {232}{}{Yes, who needs it?}
{232}{}{是的，谁需要它？}
### {233}{}{To everyone who has a good old nuclear-powered technology. But the fire worshippers in Phoenix are the first to buy uranium, and then they sell it to smaller buyers at five times the price.}
{233}{}{献给每一个拥有古老核动力技术的人。但凤凰城的火崇拜者是第一批购买铀的人，然后他们以五倍的价格卖给规模较小的买家。}
### {234}{}{Doesn't uranium lead to radiation sickness?}
{234}{}{铀不会导致辐射病吗？}
### {235}{}{Leads... if you eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. This ore is weakly radioactive and harmless until it is in the reactor. That's when it's best to stay as far away as possible.}
{235}{}{潜在客户...如果你早餐、午餐和晚餐都吃。这种矿石在进入反应堆之前是弱放射性和无害的。这时最好尽可能远离。}

### {236}{}{You realize that you're not helping at all... honest people?}
{236}{}{你意识到你根本没有帮助...诚实的人？}
### {237}{}{Are you talking about Faber's mercenaries? I don't care. My people and I need work. And the colony provides jobs and stable earnings. That's enough for me.}
{237}{}{你在说费伯的雇佣兵吗？我不在乎。我和我的员工需要工作。殖民地提供了就业机会和稳定的收入。这对我来说已经足够了。}
### {238}{}{I will pay 30 caps.}
{238}{}{我将支付30个瓶盖。}
### {239}{}{This changes a lot.}
{239}{}{这变化很大。}
### {240}{}{So what?}
{240}{}{那又怎样？}
### {241}{}{In your leaky pockets, even the dust of the road is not worth hoping for.}
{241}{}{在你漏洞百出的口袋里，即使是路上的灰尘也不值得期待。}
### {242}{}{Oops, it's gone somewhere...}
{242}{}{哎呀，它不见了...}
### {243}{}{The local sect worships atomic energy. However, after the destruction of their main temple, little remained of them. Anyway, it was under them that Phoenix became a real city.}
{243}{}{当地教派崇拜原子能。然而，在他们的主庙被毁后，他们所剩无几。总之，正是在他们的领导下，凤凰城才成为一座真正的城市。}

#Emergency adjustments
### {250}{}{...I'm telling you, we're not going anywhere... Wait, you're not from the administration, are you? Then forget it.}
{250}{}{…我告诉你，我们哪儿也不去...等等，你不是政府的，是吗？那就忘了。}
### {251}{}{What's the problem with the caravan?}
{251}{}{大篷车出了什么问题？}
### {252}{}{Don't you know the latest developments? The mine is about to close, which means our business too.}
{252}{}{你不知道最新进展吗？矿井即将关闭，这也意味着我们的生意。}
### {253}{}{What's wrong with the mine?}
{253}{}{矿井怎么了？}
### {254}{}{For now.}
{254}{}{现在。}
### {255}{}{The mine is destroyed, and it will take a lot of time and effort to clear it. I doubt this place will have a future.}
{255}{}{地雷被毁了，清理它需要花费大量的时间和精力。我怀疑这个地方是否会有未来。}
### {256}{}{After the fire worshippers in Phoenix were atomized, the mine lost its main customer. Of course, there is a demand for ore, other settlements are ready to buy it, but it is unlikely that this will pay for the work of the mine.}
{256}{}{凤凰城的拜火者被雾化后，该矿失去了主要客户。当然，对矿石有需求，其他定居点也准备购买，但这不太可能支付矿山的工作费用。}
### {257}{}{The garrison of Flagstaff is defeated, the prisoners have escaped, the manager is dead. Now we don't even know who we work for. It seems that no one needs our vacancy now.}
{257}{}{弗拉格斯塔夫的守军被打败了，犯人逃走了，经理死了。现在我们甚至不知道自己为谁工作。现在似乎没有人需要我们的空缺。}
### {258}{}{You're caravan drivers. Do you care who you work for?}
{258}{}{你们是大篷车司机。你在乎你为谁工作吗？}
### {259}{}{We have a special reputation. Because of the connection with the fire worshippers and Faber's mercenaries, not everyone will want to work with us. Competitors especially do not like us out of envy. After recent events, it will be very difficult to change patrons. If at all possible.}
{259}{}{我们有着特殊的声誉。由于与火崇拜者和费伯雇佣兵的联系，并不是每个人都愿意与我们合作。竞争对手尤其不喜欢我们，因为他们嫉妒我们。在最近的事件之后，更换顾客将非常困难。如果可能的话。}
### {260}{}{So you canceled all flights?}
{260}{}{所以你取消了所有的航班？}
### {261}{}{Exactly. Until the situation gets better, we will have to stay in Flagstaff. I don't know what we're going to do yet, but we'll figure something out.}
{261}{}{确切地在情况好转之前，我们将不得不留在弗拉格斯塔夫。我还不知道我们要做什么，但我们会想办法的。}

### {300}{}{Hey, we're kind of on our way. Will you take me to Phoenix?}
{300}{}{嘿，我们正在路上。你能带我去凤凰城吗？}
### {301}{}{We don't take fellow travelers. The customer gets nervous when unverified people enter the convoy.}

### {302}{}{Can you at least answer the questions?}
{302}{}{你至少能回答这些问题吗？}
### {303}{}{Then goodbye.}
{303}{}{然后再见。}
### {304}{}{In Phoenix, only gallows on lampposts are waiting for us. We don't know what to do yet.}
{304}{}{在凤凰城，只有灯柱上的绞刑架在等着我们。我们还不知道该怎么办。}
### {305}{}{Severe case.}
{305}{}{严重病例。}
### {306}{}{In Phoenix, the tongue is cut off for cheating. You're lucky we're not in Phoenix.}

### {310}{}{500 caps will make me tested?}
{310}{}{500个瓶盖会让我经受考验吗？}
### {311}{}{OK. A good welding for a fellow traveler. I'll take you to the convoy, but on general terms.}

### {319}{}{Then goodbye.}
{319}{}{然后再见。}

### {320}{}{Firstly, the weight of the luggage is not more than 50 pounds. Secondly, we will make a stop in San Brahmin for the night and only then we will go to Phoenix. Will it suit you? Then come when you're ready.}
{320}{}{首先，行李的重量不超过50磅。其次，我们将在圣婆罗门停留一晚，然后我们将前往凤凰城。它适合你吗？等你准备好了再来。}

{321}{}{太好了，给我时间准备。}
### {322}{}{I can be useful on the way. Don't you need a free employee?}

{331}{}{我说，把这些垃圾清理干净！我不会为了你的财物而冒险乘坐大篷车。}
