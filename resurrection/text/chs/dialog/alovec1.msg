{601}{}{关于重生你还能告诉我什么？}
#{602}{}{Can I ask about something else?}
{602}{}{我能问些别的事吗？}
#{650}{}{There's not much.

They're annihilating entire villages and towns, and the inhabitants are being abducted to an unknown location.}

#{800}{}{We are Mutant Hunters, we want to rid the world of mutant scum. All of them without exception. We want to rid humanity of this putrid disease.}

{900}{}{我可不这么认为！如果你再这样说，我就把你的头打掉，塞进你的脖子里。}
#{901}{}{OK.}
{901}{}{好 啊。}
#{902}{}{So listen. Even mutants have a right to live!}

{1100}{}{胡说，谁都可以这么说。消失。}
#{1101}{}{Listen, this is critical information which may mean a breakthrough in your fighting the Rebirth. And I must tell it to someone important, someone who will know what to do with it. I can't just start explaining this to nobodies such as yourself!}
{1101}{}{听着，这是一个关键的信息，可能意味着在你的战斗重生突破。我必须告诉一个重要的人，一个知道如何处理它的人。我不能向你这样的无名小卒解释这件事！}
#{1102}{}{Well, it was worth a try.}
{1102}{}{嗯，值得一试。}
#{1150}{}{Oh. Damn... Well you better go find Sebastian. Don't just stand there!}
{1150}{}{哦。该死。。。你最好去找塞巴斯蒂安。别站在那儿！}
#{1151}{}{On my way.}

#{1202}{}{Sorry. Let's forget the whole incident.}
{1202}{}{对不起的。让我们忘掉整个事件吧。}
#{1300}{}{I can only let through those who are interested in joining us. But anyone like that must first kill ten Rebirth ghouls. And as proof, you must bring back their talismans. You will be paid the standard rate.}
{1300}{}{我只能让那些有兴趣加入我们的人通过。但像这样的人必须先杀死十个重生的僵尸。作为证据，你必须带回他们的护身符。你将得到标准工资。}
