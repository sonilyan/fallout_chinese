{100}{}{Oh, hello. Didn't see you coming. You need something?}
{101}{}{I'm just checking things down here.}
{102}{}{I don't know. Are you offering services?}
{103}{}{No, nothing. Bye.}
#
{104}{}{I'm not really sure this conversation is needed. Well... what is it?}
#checking things...
{105}{}{How convenient. There is something I need. I left my suitcase at home with all my personal belongings inside,
 even my makeup. You can't even guess how busy I am down here so... can I ask you a favor, to bring me that suitcase?}
{106}{}{That could be arranged. What do I get for this?}
{107}{}{Sure. Tell me where's your house.}
{108}{}{I need to finish something first. I'll be back later.}
#what do I get for this...
{109}{}{Well, I have this first aid book. People always need these... Or I can give you some cash, about $500. If you
 are willing to do it, just let me know.}
#where to find case...
{110}{}{My house is in Miners Town, residential area, next to that small church or whatever they call that place. I
 know it sounds awkward, but I moved out a while ago, left in a hurry. I... wasn't running from anyone, just wanted a
 change. Got tired of the sheriff's empty talk how safe we were... almost got shot one time. Bullet just passed through a
 wall, only inches away from me. Here, I don't have to worry about that, thicker walls. [Smiles.]}
{111}{}{Lucky you. I sense there's more than that...}
{112}{}{I'm not sure you are telling me the real reason you moved here.}
#
{113}{}{[Sighs.] Hm, I knew somebody would ask me that. I encountered some "difficulties". First of all, you must
 promise me that this stays between us. I have a job here, an opportunity to do something with my life, and don't want to
 mess things up.}
{114}{}{You have my word. So, what's the problem?}
{115}{}{I'm not good in keeping promises.}
#the problem...
{116}{}{I mentioned that small church near my house. Almost every night some strange people gathered there,
 wearing odd looking robes. I saw them only once because they were hiding but I remembered their voices and could
 tell those were the same people every other night. I thought I heard something terrible... [takes a deep breath.] Here it
 goes, they were planning to brainwash most of the working population, turn them into slaves.}
{117}{}{My god, that is serious! Did you warn the authorities about this?}
#
{118}{}{I did... And they declared me insane for seeing ghosts and hearing "voices"... Most of the locals avoided me,
 actually making me feel down, discarded... and the way they looked at me... I said to myself, no one should be treated
 like this. So I left. And I think I did the right thing, there was nothing else I could do.}
{119}{}{And you were indeed right, but I must warn them. They have to listen this time or I'll make them listen.}
{120}{}{I'm sorry you had to end up here because of that.}
#119 and 120...
{121}{}{I don't want to bother you with my past. This was all very hard for me and... If you are about to go there, do
 this for me. And one more thing, don't make a fool of yourself, I've been there. Feels much worse than it sounds.}
{122}{}{[Leave.]}
#nod good in keeping promises...
{123}{}{Then our little chat is over. I don't feel comfortable telling you all this, maybe you already think I'm crazy.
 Just leave.}
{124}{}{[Leave.]}
#what are you offering...
{125}{}{Hey, do you think that's funny!? I can offer a bullet up your ass!}
{126}{}{Oh, forgive me. That's not... I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.}
#
{127}{}{Well, you just did. Get out!}
{128}{}{Oh, sorry. [Leave.]}
{129}{}{And why should I do that, bitch!}
#job taken...
{130}{}{Time runs so fast. It feels like you were here just five minutes ago. So what's the occasion this time?}
{131}{}{I just wanted to see how you are doing.}
{132}{}{Nothing special, I'll come back later.}
#how you were doing...
{133}{}{That's nice... but without my suitcase, not as good as I could be. When I'm not all dressed up, I'm feeling
 worse, get the picture?}
{134}{}{Sure thing, I understand your needs, kind of...}
#
{135}{}{Look. [You show her the suitcase.] I managed to get this for you. This will change your life for sure, right?}
#
{136}{}{Yes, I didn't ask you to understand, just to bring it here. Anyway, take this book and money, you did what I
 asked. That would be all, have a good one.}
{137}{}{Sure thing, miss.}
#
{138}{}{Hey, what's up?}
{139}{}{Nothing I think. See you later.}
#
{140}{}{I don't want to talk to you. And I mean it!}
{141}{}{Why are you bothering me again, pig. The door's over there!}
{142}{}{Do you know how boring you are? Beat it!}
{143}{}{[Leave.]}
