### {201}{}{What exactly are you suggesting?}

### {253}{}{I'll be honest, I'm interested in your product.}
{253}{}{老实说，我对你的产品很感兴趣。}
### {254}{}{Stay away from me.}

{266}{}{那我就打断你的手指。}

### {270}{}{Where did you get all this chemistry from?}

### {271}{}{From different places, obviously. I buy something from scavengers, something from caravans from the south, and I cook some preparations myself on the stove. Don't worry, everything is sterile.}
{271}{}{显然来自不同的地方。我从拾荒者那里买一些东西，从南方的大篷车那里买一些，我自己在炉子上做饭。别担心，一切都是无菌的。}
### {272}{}{Doesn't sound very reliable, don't you think?}
{272}{}{听起来不太可靠，你不觉得吗？}
### {273}{}{Calmly. Chemistry is almost without impurities. You can't find the best dope in the city... Except, perhaps, the Followers of Fire. But they don't share it with anyone.}
{273}{}{冷静。化学几乎没有杂质。你在这个城市找不到最好的毒品...也许除了火的追随者。但他们不会与任何人分享。}

{279}{}{我需要高质量的药品。我的病人的生命取决于它。}

### {282}{}{Another thing.}
{282}{}{还有一件事}
### {283}{}{It's still too doubtful. I'm leaving.}

### {284}{}{I'm from Murphy. And I need medicine for eternal sleep.}
{284}{}{我来自墨菲。我需要药物来保证永远的睡眠。}
### {285}{}{I don't know why you need it, and I don't want to know. But I have poison from the tail of a radscorpion and various drugs for overdose. Choose what you have enough caps for.}
{285}{}{我不知道你为什么需要它，我也不想知道。但我有一只蛇蝎尾巴上的毒药和各种过量服用的药物。选择你有足够的瓶盖。}
### {286}{}{Let's see...}
{286}{}{让我们看看...}
### {287}{}{But if anyone asks, I have nothing to do with it.}

### {293}{}{Ha. What an insight. What's it to you?}
{293}{}{哈多么有洞察力啊。你怎么了？}
### {294}{}{But why such secrecy?}
{294}{}{但为什么要这样保密呢？}
### {295}{}{There are those who don't like my business. Competitors, fuck them. Or those sectarians from the Cathedral. They want to take over the entire turnover of medicines for themselves, and dealers like me are paid pennies. It's more profitable for me to work for myself, but you can't explain it to them.}
{295}{}{有些人不喜欢我的生意。竞争对手，操他们。或者那些来自大教堂的宗派主义者。他们想为自己接管药品的全部营业额，而像我这样的经销商只得到几分钱的报酬。为自己工作对我来说更有利可图，但你无法向他们解释。}
### {296}{}{If not from Followers, then where do you get the drugs?}
{296}{}{如果不是来自追随者，那么你从哪里得到毒品？}
### {297}{}{Working for yourself in such a place is a risky business.}
{297}{}{在这样的地方为自己工作是件冒险的事。}
### {298}{}{Damn, don't twist my balls. Do you know the Red Cardinals? They are usually cleaned in the old building of the sports club. Orris is their leader. He makes sure that nothing interferes with my business. Not for free, of course.}
{298}{}{该死，别扭我的蛋蛋。你认识红雀队吗？他们通常在体育俱乐部的旧楼里打扫。欧里斯是他们的领袖。他确保没有任何东西干扰我的生意。当然不是免费的。}
### {299}{}{Damn, don't twist my balls. I used to be protected by Orris's guys. But his death hurt my business. I don't know how I'm going to survive now.}
{299}{}{该死，别扭我的蛋蛋。我曾经被奥的人保护过。但他的死伤害了我的生意。我不知道我现在该怎么活下去。}

### {302}{}{Then do it somewhere else! Larry, though he was trash, but he had periods of epiphany. At such moments, he managed to earn caps and then lowered them to a new batch of dope. I had a good income from this, do you understand? And what will I have with a cold corpse?}
{302}{}{那就去别的地方吧！拉里，虽然他是个废物，但他有一段顿悟的时期。在这样的时刻，他设法赢得了上限，然后把它们降到了新的一批毒品中。我从中获得了不错的收入，你明白吗？一具冰冷的尸体会给我带来什么？}

{317}{}{你是说那个瘾君子...他叫什么名字...拉里？}
### {318}{}{Larry. Even though he was trash, he had periods of epiphany. At such moments, I managed to earn light caps on it. And what will I have now?}
{318}{}{拉里。尽管他是个废物，但他也有过顿悟的时期。在这样的时刻，我设法在上面赚了很多钱。现在我会有什么？}
### {319}{}{You wouldn't be able to make money on someone else's problem for a long time. Think about it.}
{319}{}{你在很长一段时间内都无法在别人的问题上赚钱。想想看。}

### {320}{}{With those guys who took your bike, you should be careful. They're from the Red Cardinals gang, and this gang practically owns this neighborhood. Make one of them angry, and you won't live. But of course it's yours.}
{320}{}{和那些拿走你自行车的人在一起，你应该小心。他们来自红雀队，而这个帮派实际上拥有这个社区。让他们中的一个生气，你就活不下去了。但它当然是你的。}
### {321}{}{I'll take that into account.}
{321}{}{我会考虑到的。}
### {322}{}{I have a package for you from the Blue Shields.}
