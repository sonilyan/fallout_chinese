#{100}{}{You see Tom.}
{100}{}{你看见汤姆了。}
#{101}{}{Big white eyes on the face of this black man seem to shine with bright sadness.}
{101}{}{这个黑人脸上的大白眼睛似乎闪烁着明亮的悲伤。}
#{102}{}{Praise to you! Don??t stir from the right path.}
{102}{}{赞美你！不要偏离正道。}
#{103}{}{Oh God... You are still here...}
{103}{}{哦上帝...你还在这里...}
#{110}{}{Just as I were going to swallow the first spoon of my soup, the flies flew in. You know, it??s pretty unpleasant, but you have to deal with it.}
{110}{}{正当我要吞下第一勺汤时，苍蝇飞了进来。你知道，这很不愉快，但你必须处理它。}
#{111}{}{Hello. Such a good day today, isn??t it?}
{111}{}{你好。今天天气真好，不是吗？}
#{112}{}{Fine, eat, I won??t bother you.}
{112}{}{好吧，吃吧，我不会打扰你的。}
#{113}{}{Right. I better go get some fresh air outside.}
{113}{}{正确的。我最好出去透透气。}
#{114}{}{Who are you?}
{114}{}{你是谁？}
#{115}{}{I'm Tom, simple worker.}
{115}{}{我是汤姆，简单的工人。}
#{116}{}{Nice to meet you. Perhaps, we can talk next time.}
{116}{}{很高兴认识你。也许，我们下次可以谈谈。}
#{117}{}{Why are they treating you this way, Tom?}
{117}{}{他们为什么这样对你，汤姆？}
#{118}{}{Everybody is treating me like this. Blacks and whites. Maybe, it??s something with my nature. But don??t pay any attention - they just fool around, they don??t mean harm. Though, of course, there are those who would just break your face, if you'll allow them to. Fortunately, not many of that kind left here - the community doesn??t like them.}
{118}{}{每个人都这样对待我。黑人和白人。也许，这是我的天性。但别在意，他们只是在瞎混，并不意味着伤害。当然，如果你允许的话，有些人会打断你的脸。幸运的是，没有多少这样的人留在这里-社区不喜欢他们。}
#{119}{}{For example?}
{119}{}{例如？}
#{120}{}{Too bad, Tom, but I will have to leave you.}
{120}{}{太糟了，汤姆，但我得离开你了。}
#{121}{}{I would make fun of you myself if I could right now, but I have no time. Breathe for now.}
{121}{}{如果我现在可以的话，我会自己取笑你，但我没有时间。暂时呼吸。}
#{122}{}{[Looks around] Uh, listen, I don??t want to talk about anyone, I??m a peaceful man!}
{122}{}{[环顾四周]呃，听着，我不想谈论任何人，我是个平和的人！}
#{123}{}{Fine, as you wish.}
{123}{}{好吧，如你所愿。}
#{124}{}{Where are you looking at? It was the white guy standing near the lockers, wasn??t it?}
{124}{}{你在看什么？是那个站在储物柜旁边的白人，不是吗？}
#{125}{}{Simon... Uh, don??t ask me about him... I don??t want to talk about it... Nor bad, nor good.}
{125}{}{西蒙...呃，别问我关于他的事...我不想谈这个...不坏也不好。}
#{126}{}{I can help you get rid of him, if you want.}
{126}{}{如果你愿意，我可以帮你摆脱他。}
#{127}{}{I can help you get rid of him, if you'll tell me, who stole the keys from the administrator.}
{127}{}{我可以帮你摆脱他，如果你告诉我，谁偷了管理员的钥匙。}
#{128}{}{Oh Lord! I'm a peaceful man, Leave me alone! Simon is a scumbag for sure, I would appreciate him to be somewhere else, but I won??t be carrying bloodshed on my soul. Plus, I don??t have anything to pay anyway.}
{128}{}{哦，上帝！我是个平和的人，离我远点！西蒙当然是个卑鄙小人，我希望他能去别的地方，但我不会在我的灵魂上带着鲜血。另外，反正我也没钱付。}
#{129}{}{Bloodshed? You said "bloodshed"?! Tom, I didn??t mean to kill him! Scaring him a little would be enough.}
{129}{}{流血？你说“流血”？！汤姆，我不是故意杀他的！吓他一点就够了。}
#{130}{}{Honestly speaking, I don??t trust you. Not many good things are heard about you in Salt Lake. Sorry.}
{130}{}{老实说，我不相信你。你在盐湖城的好消息不多。对不起的。}
#{131}{}{Puny beggar, I don??t even want to talk to you.}
{131}{}{小乞丐，我甚至不想和你说话。}
#{132}{}{Fine, Tom, I won??t insist.}
{132}{}{好吧，汤姆，我不会坚持的。}
#{133}{}{Damn coward, I don??t even want to talk to you.}
{133}{}{该死的胆小鬼，我甚至不想和你说话。}
#{134}{}{[Thinks a while, looking around] Listen, let's step into somewhere more private, okay?}
{134}{}{[想了一会儿，环顾四周]听着，我们去个更私密的地方，好吗？}
#{135}{}{Sure, I'm listening...}
{135}{}{当然，我在听...}
#{136}{}{[Whispers] Please understand. That Simon - he's an arrogant bastard. He will slice anyone, who his complexion and position allows to. He??s a very cruel man. God forbids such people to get high in power!}
{136}{}{请理解。那个西蒙-他是个傲慢的混蛋。只要他的肤色和体位允许，他就会把任何人切成片。他是个非常残忍的人。上帝禁止这样的人掌权！}
#{137}{}{Sure. And that??s why I want to help.}
{137}{}{当然。所以我才想帮忙。}
#{138}{}{I hear, but this doesn??t matter to me.}
{138}{}{我听说了，但这对我来说无关紧要。}
#{139}{}{And I have a great plan, but peaceful. [sights] I stole the keys from the administrator and hid it in the toilet. Yes, it was really me.}
{139}{}{我有一个伟大的计划，但是很平静。我从管理员那里偷了钥匙藏在厕所里。是的，真的是我。}
#{140}{}{Hmm, continue.}
{140}{}{嗯，继续。}
#{141}{}{I thought that will create some panic in the factory, and when the investigation starts, I would plant them to Simon. But, this turned out to be higher than my principles. I can??t frame a person, even such an animal as Simon. Besides, this is very risky in my position.}
{141}{}{我想这会在工厂里引起一些恐慌，当调查开始时，我会把他们交给西蒙。但是，这比我的原则要高。我不能陷害一个人，即使像西蒙这样的动物。另外，这在我的位置上是非常危险的。}
#{142}{}{Well well...}
{142}{}{好吧，好吧...}
#{143}{}{Now I don??t know what to do. I thought to confess and return the keys, but then they will fire me. And I can??t lie, as you can see...}
{143}{}{现在我不知道该怎么办了。我本想坦白交还钥匙，但他们会解雇我的。我不能撒谎，正如你所看到的...}
#{144}{}{Well, Tom, listen: sit quietly, keep shut, I will think of something.}
{144}{}{好吧，汤姆，听着：安静地坐着，闭嘴，我会想点什么的。}
#{145}{}{Ha, confessed it yourself! That??s it, wait for my decision and mercy, so I don??t tell about you.}
{145}{}{哈，你自己承认的！就这样，等着我的决定和仁慈吧，这样我就不会告诉你了。}
#{146}{}{May the God bless you!}
{146}{}{愿上帝保佑你！}
#{147}{}{Er, fine. Now we must say to each other farewell.}
{147}{}{呃，好吧。现在我们必须互相道别。}
#{148}{}{Yes, I deserve it, it seems... Please - think about it, think about it good.}
{148}{}{是的，我活该，似乎...请-好好想想，好好想想。}
#{149}{}{As I decide - that??s how it will be. Now get away from me.}
{149}{}{正如我所决定的，事情就是这样。现在离我远点。}
#{150}{}{About Simon...}
{150}{}{关于西蒙...}
#{151}{}{What about him?}
{151}{}{他呢？}
#{152}{}{He's dead. And don??t ask, how it happened - it??s not important.}
{152}{}{他死了。不要问，这是怎么发生的-这不重要。}
#{153}{}{Rejoice - he got fired! For... The key theft. Who would have thought, right?}
{153}{}{他被解雇了！为了...钥匙被盗。谁会想到，对吧？}
#{154}{}{I wanted to ask something, but forget it.}
{154}{}{我想问点什么，但忘了它。}
#{155}{}{Oh, God, what have you done! it seems nothing in this world can be solved peacefully. Now his death is on me! Oh, God...}
{155}{}{哦，天哪，你做了什么！这世界上似乎没有什么可以和平解决的。现在他的死在我身上！哦，天啊...}
#{156}{}{Hey old man, shut your mouth. I helped you - solved the problem. Have some respect. And give me something. Such things don??t cost a sandwich!}
{156}{}{嘿，老头，闭嘴。我帮你解决了问题。请尊重我。给我点东西。这样的东西一个三明治也不值钱！}
#{157}{}{How can I? I??m a simple worker. I don??t make much money. I can only give you my gas suit. You can sell it.}
{157}{}{我该怎么办？我是个简单的工人。我赚不了多少钱。我只能把我的加油服给你。你可以卖掉它。}
#{158}{}{Give me the suit. Better, than nothing.}
{158}{}{把西装给我。总比什么都没有好。}
#{159}{}{Here. And no more shit alright? I??m pissed of already. Enough is enough!}
{159}{}{在这里。别再胡闹了好吗？我已经气坏了。够了，够了！}
#{160}{}{This is you problem. Bye.}
{160}{}{这是你的问题。再见。}
#{161}{}{[Smiles] Damn that was good! You actually did it! Thank you, for everything you did. And most importantly - for you kindness and understanding. Something that is really missing in this world.}
{161}{}{[微笑]真他妈好！你真的做到了！谢谢你所做的一切。最重要的是――为了你的善良和理解。在这个世界上真正缺少的东西。}
#{162}{}{Yeah. It??s a shame that saving the world can??t be placed in one's pocket...}
{162}{}{是 啊。可惜的是，拯救世界不能放在一个人的口袋里...}
#{163}{}{Glad to be of help.}
{163}{}{很高兴能帮上忙。}
#{164}{}{Uh, I have nothing to give you. I??m a simple worker. I don??t make much money. I can only give you my gas suit. You can sell it.}
{164}{}{呃，我没什么可以给你的。我是个简单的工人。我赚不了多少钱。我只能把我的加油服给你。你可以卖掉它。}
#{165}{}{Here. I hope, it will help you somehow. Take care.}
{165}{}{在这里。我希望，它会对你有所帮助。当心。}
#{166}{}{Bye. And don??t leave anyone bully you again.}
{166}{}{再见。别让任何人再欺负你。}
#{167}{}{Tom, someone stole the keys from the administrator, and I??m going to find the thief. Whoever did this - he won??t get away. You don??t want the suspicion to fall on you, right?}
{167}{}{汤姆，有人偷了管理员的钥匙，我要去找小偷。不管是谁干的，他都逃不掉。你不想被怀疑，对吧？}
#{168}{}{About Simon. I will help you to get rid of him, if you tell me, who stole the keys.}
{168}{}{关于西蒙。如果你告诉我是谁偷了钥匙，我会帮你把他赶走的。}
#{169}{}{Cold sweat, wide pupils, increased heart rate... My detective experience tells me that you are hiding something.}
{169}{}{冷汗，瞳孔扩大，心率加快...我的侦探经验告诉我你在隐瞒什么。}
#{170}{}{You??re not a good liar, Tom. I see, you know more, than you tell.}
{170}{}{你不是个好骗子，汤姆。我明白了，你知道的比你说的还多。}
#{171}{}{[In shock] Private detective? Is this a thing in our times? Wow...}
{171}{}{私人侦探？这是我们这个时代的事吗？真 的...}
#{172}{}{For me it??s just hobby, not my duty...}
{172}{}{对我来说这只是爱好，不是我的职责...}
#{173}{}{I have the keys. Remind me, what you wanted to do with them?}
{173}{}{我有钥匙。提醒我，你想用它们做什么？}
#{174}{}{*smell* I can sense a thief from a mile away! [take a deep breath] YES, IT IS YOU!}
{174}{}{*我能感觉到一英里外有小偷！[深呼吸]是的，是你！}
#{175}{}{Umm... You??re not serious, aren't you?.. Heh... I mean, how can you sense the thief...}
{175}{}{嗯...你不是认真的吧？。。嘿...我是说，你怎么能感觉到小偷...}
#{176}{}{[Stare at him seriously]}
{176}{}{[严肃地盯着他]}
#{180}{}{Hey, old man, want some... *milk*? Ha-ha!}
{180}{}{嘿，老头子，想要点...*牛奶*？哈哈！}
#{181}{}{Tom stares again. Don??t look away, dumbass!}
{181}{}{汤姆又盯着我看。别看别处，笨蛋！}
#{182}{}{Don??t call you a nigger? Sorry, I can??t!}
{182}{}{别叫你黑鬼？对不起，我不能！}
#{183}{}{Tom, how about a joke about Africa?}
{183}{}{汤姆，来个关于非洲的笑话怎么样？}
#{184}{}{Hey, Tom, you can??t get a black eye, can you?}
{184}{}{嘿，汤姆，你的眼睛不会黑的，是吗？}
#{185}{}{How did it happened, to have so many blacks in here? Tom did you gather everyone?}
{185}{}{怎么会有这么多黑人在这里？汤姆你把所有人都召集起来了吗？}
#{1116}{}{Nice to meet you. Perhaps, we can talk next time.}
{1116}{}{很高兴认识你。也许，我们下次可以谈谈。}
#{1121}{}{I would make fun of you myself if I could right now, but I have no time. Breathe for now.}
