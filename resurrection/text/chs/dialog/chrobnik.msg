#{100}{}{You see an old man.}
{100}{}{你看到一个老人。}
#{150}{}{You see Jesup the gravedigger.}
{150}{}{你看那个掘墓人。}
#{200}{}{You see an old man. His back is bent and he has an unfriendly look to him.}
{200}{}{你看到一个老人。他的背弯了，看上去很不友好。}
#{250}{}{You see Jesup the gravedigger. He's looking grouchy as always.}
{250}{}{你看那个掘墓人。他看起来像往常一样不高兴。}
#{300}{}{Get out of here.}
{300}{}{离开这里。}
#{301}{}{Leave me alone.}
{301}{}{别管我。}
#{302}{}{Don't bother me.}
{302}{}{别打扰我。}
#{500}{}{What? Who's died?}
{500}{}{什么？谁死了？}
#{501}{}{Why do you ask who's died?}
{501}{}{你为什么问谁死了？}
#{502}{}{Huh?}
{502}{}{嗯？}
#{550}{}{I'm the gravedigger, dumbass. Why else would you come to see me?}
{550}{}{我是掘墓人，笨蛋。不然你为什么来看我？}
#{551}{}{Just, you know... to talk. My name is }
{551}{}{只是，你知道。。。说话。我的名字是}
#{600}{}{Well, my name is Jesup and I'm not interested in talking to you or anyone else, so leave me alone.}
{600}{}{好吧，我叫杰苏普，我不想和你或其他人说话，所以别管我。}
#{601}{}{Why?}
{601}{}{为什么？}
#{602}{}{OK, as you wish.}
{602}{}{好的，如你所愿。}
#{603}{}{I don't like your attitude. I'll make you your own customer, gravedigger!}
{603}{}{我不喜欢你的态度。我会让你成为你自己的顾客，掘墓人！}
#{650}{}{I'm the gravedigger, dumbass. Why else would you come to see me?}
{650}{}{我是掘墓人，笨蛋。不然你为什么来看我？}
#{651}{}{Just, you know... to talk. My name is }
{651}{}{只是，你知道。。。说话。我的名字是}
#{700}{}{Damn! This used to be peaceful work, before you showed up to bother me! Or at least, until recently... before all these robberies started.}
{700}{}{该死！在你来打扰我之前，这曾经是一份平静的工作！或者至少，直到最近。。。在所有这些抢劫开始之前。}
#{701}{}{Robberies? If you have any problems, perhaps I could help.}
{701}{}{抢劫？如果你有什么问题，也许我能帮你。}
#{702}{}{Alright, I'll leave you alone, if you insist.}
{702}{}{好吧，如果你坚持的话，我就不打扰你了。}
#{703}{}{I'll leave you in peace eternal, grampa!}
{703}{}{我会让你永远安息的，爷爷！}
#{750}{}{You could, but I don't want to rob you of your time. I'll tell you up front that nobody gets rich digging graves for a living, so don't expect any juicy rewards for your help, if that's what you were after.}
{750}{}{你可以，但我不想抢你的时间。我会事先告诉你，没有人靠挖坟墓为生而发财，所以不要指望你的帮助会得到任何丰厚的回报，如果这是你想要的。}
#{751}{}{I'll help you anyway.}
{751}{}{反正我会帮你的。}
#{752}{}{I see, in that case I'm not really interested.}
{752}{}{我明白了，那样的话我就不太感兴趣了。}
#{800}{}{Well if you really want, you can try, why not. There's a grave robber about after dark. Several times now I've woken up in the morning to find graves dug up and looted. Damn, I can understand people wanting to be better off. Hell, just between you and me, I occasionally take things off the corpses before burying them. That is, when there is anything left to take, and when the relatives aren't looking. But this bastard doesn't have any respect. He takes everything of value, including teeth. Teeth! And then I have the work of filling the grave again to look forward to!}
{800}{}{如果你真的想，你可以试试，为什么不呢。天黑后有个盗墓贼在附近。现在有好几次我早上醒来发现坟墓被挖出来并被洗劫一空。妈的，我能理解人们想要更好的生活。见鬼，就在你我之间，我偶尔会在埋葬尸体之前把东西从尸体上取下来。也就是说，当有什么东西要带走的时候，当亲戚们不在看的时候。但这个混蛋一点也不尊重。他拿走了所有值钱的东西，包括牙齿。牙齿！然后，我又有了一个充满期待的坟墓工作！}
#{801}{}{Why don't you ask the police for help?}
{801}{}{你为什么不向警察求助呢？}
#{802}{}{What should I do about him?}
{802}{}{我该怎么处置他？}
#{850}{}{Yeah, right. They'd just tell me off for not doing my job. I guess they must think that I'm gonna run around here nights to chase the rabble away. I'm too old for that. I'm just glad I can still hold a shovel in my hands.}
{850}{}{是的，没错。他们只会因为我没做好本职工作而责备我。我猜他们一定认为我会在这里到处跑，把那些乌合之众赶走。我太老了。我很高兴我还能拿着铲子。}
#{851}{}{So what about this grave robber?}
{851}{}{那么这个盗墓贼呢？}
#{900}{}{Think, smart guy! Get rid of him. Chase him away or kill him, I don't care, just as long as he stops showing up around here. There are still many graves out there he hasn't touched, so he's bound to show up again. All you have to do is wait around for him in the cemetery for a few nights.}
{900}{}{想想，聪明人！把他赶走。把他赶走或者杀了他，我不在乎，只要他不再出现在这里。外面还有很多坟墓他没碰过，所以他一定会再出现的。你所要做的就是在墓地等他几个晚上。}
#{901}{}{Think, doll face! Get rid of him. Chase him away or kill him, I don't care, just as long as he stops showing up around here. There are still many graves out there he hasn't touched, so he's bound to show up again. All you have to do is wait around for him in the cemetery for a few nights.}
{901}{}{想想，娃娃脸！把他赶走。把他赶走或者杀了他，我不在乎，只要他不再出现在这里。外面还有很多坟墓他没碰过，所以他一定会再出现的。你所要做的就是在墓地等他几个晚上。}
#{902}{}{I have some more questions.}
{902}{}{我还有一些问题。}
#{903}{}{OK, I'll see what I can do.}
{903}{}{好吧，我看看我能做什么。}
#{904}{}{And could I wait at your place until then?}
{904}{}{我能在你家等你吗？}
#{950}{}{Damn! This used to be peaceful work, before you showed up to bother me! Or at least, until recently... before all these robberies started.}
{950}{}{该死！在你来打扰我之前，这曾经是一份平静的工作！或者至少，直到最近。。。在所有这些抢劫开始之前。}
#{951}{}{Robberies? If you have any problems, perhaps I could help.}
{951}{}{抢劫？如果你有什么问题，也许我能帮你。}

#{953}{}{I'll leave you in peace eternal, grampa!}
{953}{}{我会让你永远安息的，爷爷！}
#{1000}{}{You could, but I don't want to rob you of your time. I'll tell you up front that nobody gets rich digging graves for a living, so don't expect any juicy rewards for your help, if that's what you were after.}

#{1002}{}{I see, in that case I'm not really interested.}
{1002}{}{我明白了，那样的话我就不太感兴趣了。}
#{1050}{}{I've told you all you need to know, so buzz off until you've rid me of this robber.}
{1050}{}{我已经告诉你所有你需要知道的，所以在你把这个强盗干掉之前滚开。}
#{1051}{}{OK.}
{1051}{}{好 啊。}
#{1100}{}{What the... You again? I told you I'm not interested in company.}
{1100}{}{怎么了。。。又是你？我告诉过你我对公司不感兴趣。}
#{1101}{}{Why?}
{1101}{}{为什么？}
#{1102}{}{OK, as you wish.}
{1102}{}{好的，如你所愿。}
#{1103}{}{I don't like your attitude. I'll make you your own customer, gravedigger!}
{1103}{}{我不喜欢你的态度。我会让你成为你自己的顾客，掘墓人！}
#{1150}{}{What the... You again? I told you I'm not interested in company.}
{1150}{}{怎么了。。。又是你？我告诉过你我对公司不感兴趣。}
#{1151}{}{You mentioned robberies, perhaps I could help you after all.}
{1151}{}{你提到抢劫，也许我能帮你。}
#{1152}{}{You mentioned robberies, perhaps I could help you after all.}
{1152}{}{你提到抢劫，也许我能帮你。}

{1154}{}{我不喜欢你的态度。我会让你成为你自己的顾客，掘墓人！}
#{1200}{}{So, am I rid of that robber rascal yet?}
{1200}{}{那么，我摆脱那个强盗流氓了吗？}
#{1201}{}{Actually, I have some questions for you first.}
{1201}{}{实际上，我先有几个问题要问你。}
#{1202}{}{Yes, he's dead.}
{1202}{}{是的，他死了。}
#{1203}{}{Yes, he'll never show up here again.}
{1203}{}{是的，他再也不会出现在这里了。}
#{1204}{}{Yes, he's dead, but he somehow managed to rob all the graves and most likely hauled the loot away before I got him.}
{1204}{}{是的，他死了，但他设法抢劫了所有的坟墓，很可能在我抓到他之前就把赃物拖走了。}
#{1205}{}{Yes, he'll never show up here again, but first he somehow managed to rob all the graves and most likely hauled the loot away as well.}
{1205}{}{是的，他再也不会出现在这里了，但首先他设法抢劫了所有的坟墓，很可能也把赃物拖走了。}
#{1206}{}{I just want to let you know I'm on it. See you later.}
{1206}{}{我只想让你知道我在做。再见。}
#{1207}{}{Not yet. If I need to take care of him, it would be useful to be able to wait at your place until the time is right.}
{1207}{}{还没有。如果我需要照顾他，最好能在你家等时机成熟。}
#{1250}{}{You can stick your questions where the sun don't shine. I just want you to get rid of the robber!}
{1250}{}{你可以把你的问题放在阳光照不到的地方。我只想你干掉那个强盗！}
#{1251}{}{OK.}
{1251}{}{好 啊。}
#{1252}{}{You're really pissing me off, old man! Let's resolve this once and for all.}
{1252}{}{你真让我生气，老头子！让我们彻底解决这个问题。}
#{1300}{}{Ha! Good work, boy. Here's 100 caps for your trouble. It's a lot of money to me, so you better be grateful. Bye.}
{1300}{}{哈！干得好，孩子。给你100个瓶盖。这对我来说是一大笔钱，所以你最好心存感激。再见。}
#{1301}{}{Wait, I still have some questions.}
{1301}{}{等等，我还有一些问题。}
#{1302}{}{Bye.}
{1302}{}{再见。}

#{1352}{}{Bye.}
{1352}{}{再见。}
#{1400}{}{And how does that help me?! If he got everything, he won't come by anymore anyway! I was sorta hoping that you'd be at least slightly bright and rid me of him before he looted the whole damn place. Fuck, get out of my sight. Your incompetence has caused me nothing but trouble.}
{1400}{}{这对我有什么帮助？！如果他什么都有了，反正他不会再来了！我有点希望你至少聪明一点，在他抢劫整个该死的地方之前把我赶走。妈的，离开我的视线。你的无能只给我带来了麻烦。}
#{1401}{}{How about at least paying me for the effort?}
{1401}{}{至少付钱给我吧？}
#{1402}{}{See you.}
{1402}{}{再见。}
#{1450}{}{Go fuck yourself! There was no effort, so you don't get squat.}
{1450}{}{去你妈的！没有用力，所以你不能蹲着。}
#{1451}{}{I'll show you effort, you damned old scrooge, when I pick your corpse clean.}
{1451}{}{当我把你的尸体捡干净的时候，我会给你看的，你这个该死的老吝啬鬼。}
#{1452}{}{Well, it was worth it to ask. Bye.}
{1452}{}{好吧，值得一问。再见。}

#{1600}{}{Can't you leave me alone already? I have no more work for you, go bother someone else.}
{1600}{}{你不能让我一个人呆着吗？我没有工作给你了，去麻烦别人吧。}
#{1601}{}{Won't you answer my questions now?}
{1601}{}{你现在不回答我的问题吗？}
#{1602}{}{As you wish.}

#{1651}{}{Bye.}

#{1700}{}{I'm the gravedigger, you dig that, idiot? So, if you don't know of any dead guys need buryin', leave me alone.}
{1700}{}{我是掘墓人，你懂吗，白痴？所以，如果你不知道有死人需要埋葬的话，别管我。}
#{1701}{}{Wugh, me }
{1701}{}{呜，我}
#{1750}{}{Well great, my name is Jesup. And now scram!}
