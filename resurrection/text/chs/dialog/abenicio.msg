#{1550}{}{Fucking amazing work, I see I wasn't wrong about you. Here's your money. [He gives you 2200 caps.] And that's all from me - I'm going to have to send you elsewhere. Anonym himself wants to see you.}
{1550}{}{干得好，看来我没看错你。这是你的钱。[他给你2200个瓶盖。]这就是我的全部-我要送你到其他地方。匿名者要见你。}
#{1551}{}{What does he need of me?}
{1551}{}{他需要我做什么？}
#{1600}{}{I've heard that one of the soldiers survived the explosion. He already managed to tell the empire about it, too. You fucked up, and Anonym has no time to waste on incompetent idiots. Your job is over, and we never saw each other.}
{1600}{}{我听说有个士兵在爆炸中活了下来。他也已经把这件事告诉了帝国。你搞砸了，匿名者没有时间浪费在无能的白痴身上。你的工作结束了，我们从没见过面。}

#{1603}{}{You fucked up. Nobody tells me I'm incompetent, motherfucker!}
{1603}{}{你搞砸了。没人说我无能，混蛋！}
#{1604}{}{You fucked up. Nobody tells me I'm incompetent, motherfucker!}
{1604}{}{你搞砸了。没人说我无能，混蛋！}
#{1605}{}{Geh.}
{1605}{}{咯。}
#{1650}{}{[As soon as you enter the Dead Quarter you are surrounded by a group of armed men. The runt Benicio steps right before you.] I see you've worked your way up. Being Anonym's personal courier must make loads of money. I admire you buddy. [He grins.] But to get to what we're all here for. Got our caps?}
{1650}{}{[你一进入死区，就被一群武装人员包围。小矮子贝尼西奥就站在你前面。]我看你已经步步高升了。做"匿名者"的私人信使肯定能赚很多钱。我很佩服你，伙计。[他笑着说。]但是我们都在这里。拿到我们的钱了吗？}

#{1652}{}{Eh... yes, I do. But how many caps are we talking about here?}
{1652}{}{呃...是的，我知道。但我们这里说的是多少瓶盖呢？}
#{1653}{}{You misunderstand. Anonym didn't send me here to pay you - he sent me here to kill you. And I'm sure you understand that I can't disappoint him.}
{1653}{}{你误会了。匿名者派我来不是为了给你钱- 他派我来杀了你。我相信你明白我不会让他失望的。}
#{1654}{}{You misunderstand. Anonym didn't send me here to pay you - he sent me here to kill you. And I'm sure you understand that I can't disappoint him.}

#{1655}{}{I don't need caps. I come with nothing but some friendly advice. You and the other mercenaries should leave Albuquerque as soon as possible and never come back.}
{1655}{}{我不需要瓶盖。我只是来给你一些友好的建议。你和其他雇佣兵应该尽快离开阿尔伯克基，再也不要回来。}
#{1656}{}{Egh?! [After straining your brain for a while, you finally remember what Elisa asked you to do.] Shorty smash!}
{1656}{}{呃？！[你绞尽脑汁想了一会儿，终于想起来伊莉莎让你做什么了。]小矮子去死！}

#{1700}{}{Anonym promised us 4000 caps. And that's exactly how much we want. So quit yapping and give us our money.}
{1700}{}{匿名者承诺给我们4000瓶盖。这正是我们想要的。别废话了，把钱给我们。}
#{1701}{}{I don't want any trouble. Here's the sum that was agreed on.}
{1701}{}{我不想惹麻烦。这是双方商定的金额。}
#{1702}{}{The situation has changed. Anonym can't spare more than 2500 caps. I understand, it's not an optimal solution for you. [Look Benicio in the eyes.] But if you have any problems with that, you'll have to take them up to Anonym.}
{1702}{}{情况变了。“匿名者”最多只能留2500个大写字母。我明白，这不是你的最佳解决方案。[看着贝尼西奥的眼睛]但如果你对此有任何问题，你就得匿名告诉他们。}
#{1703}{}{That's too much. I think it'll be easier to just kill you all.}
{1703}{}{太过分了。我想杀了你们会更容易。}
#{1750}{}{[Benicio takes the caps.] That's how I like it. Now we can get away from this dying city. It was starting to get too hot here; the ghouls outside are getting more and more relentless, and the Hunters inside are getting more and more frustrated. [He signals the other mercenaries to leave.] Goodbye forever, buddy.}
{1750}{}{[贝尼西奥接过瓶盖]这就是我喜欢的。现在我们可以离开这个垂死的城市了。这里开始变得太热了；外面的僵尸越来越无情，里面的猎人越来越沮丧。[他示意其他雇佣兵离开]再见，伙计。}

{1752}{}{再见，贝尼西奥。我希望你不要在荒地里的某个地方呱呱叫。}
#{1800}{}{[Benicio stares at you for a while, but finally nods and accepts the caps.] OK, may Anonym choke on the rest. What matters is that we get out of this dying city.

[He signals the other mercenaries to leave.] Goodbye forever, buddy.}
{1800}{}{[贝尼西奥盯着你看了一会儿，但最后还是点了点头，接受了封盖]好吧，让阿莫尼奥窒息吧。重要的是我们要离开这个垂死的城市。这里开始变得太热了；外面的僵尸越来越无情，里面的猎人越来越沮丧。[他示意其他雇佣兵离开]再见，伙计。}

#{1850}{}{[His smile freezes.] But that's not fair! We've done a lot of dirty work for Anonym, he can't just screw us over like this!}
{1850}{}{[他的微笑冻结]但这不公平！我们为匿名者做了很多肮脏的工作，他不能就这样把我们搞砸！}
#{1851}{}{Life isn't fair, Benicio. But don't worry, you're almost at its end. I'll see to that personally.}
{1851}{}{生活是不公平的，贝尼西奥。但别担心，你快完了。我会亲自处理的。}
#{1900}{}{[His smile freezes.] I can't say I like your little recommendation. Why would we want to do something like that?}
{1900}{}{我不能说我喜欢你的小建议。我们为什么要这样做？}
#{1901}{}{I'll share a little secret with you. As you might already know, Anonym was actually Adviser Elisa from the empire. Since we removed Adviser Aran out of her way, the whole imperial army is under her command. And now she wants to cover her tracks, anything that could prove her betrayal. That includes you and your pals. So either you disappear from the town, or she'll make you disappear. Got it?}
{1901}{}{我要和你分享一个小秘密。正如你可能已经知道的，匿名实际上是帝国的顾问。既然我们把阿兰顾问赶走了，整个帝国军队都在她的指挥之下。现在她想掩盖自己的行踪，任何能证明她背叛的东西。包括你和你的朋友。所以要么你从镇上消失，要么她会让你消失。知道了？}
#{1902}{}{I meant you well. But, if you're not going to listen, I'll just have to kill you and your friends.}
{1902}{}{我是认真的。但是，如果你不听，我就杀了你和你的朋友。}
#{1903}{}{I meant you well. But, if you're not going to listen, I'll just have to kill you and your friends.}
{1903}{}{我是认真的。但是，如果你不听，我就杀了你和你的朋友。}
#{1950}{}{[Benicio stares at you for a while, but in the end nods.] Alright. We wanted to get away from this dying city anyway. It was starting to get too hot here; the ghouls outside are getting more and more relentless, and the Hunters inside are getting more and more frustrated. We don't need even the imperial army on our backs. [He signals the other mercenaries to leave.] Goodbye forever, buddy.}
{1950}{}{[贝尼西奥盯着你看了一会儿，但最后还是点了点头]好吧。无论如何，我们都想离开这个垂死的城市。这里开始变得太热了；外面的僵尸越来越无情，里面的猎人越来越沮丧。我们甚至不需要帝国军队的支持。[他示意其他雇佣兵离开]再见，伙计。}

#{2000}{}{I heard you've been making trouble in the Imperial City. Working for the Anonym requires secrecy, we can't afford to have someone hunted by the empire among us. Get lost before you get me in trouble.}
{2000}{}{听说你在皇城闹事。为匿名者工作需要保密，我们不能让帝国在我们中间猎杀任何人。在你给我惹麻烦之前滚开。}
#{2001}{}{If you say so. Bye.}
{2001}{}{如果你这样说。再见。}
#{2002}{}{No way, you won't brush me off that easily, you bastard.}
