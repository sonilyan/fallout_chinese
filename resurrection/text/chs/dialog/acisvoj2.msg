#{550}{}{Don't be deceived, you've only seen the ruins of the former metropolis so far. The real civilization starts in the empire itself.

{550}{}{别被骗了，到目前为止，你只看到了前大都市的废墟。真正的文明始于帝国本身。在我们英明的米泽列皇帝的领导下，我们正努力保持古老的技术和价值观。作为避难所居民的后代，这是我们的任务。}

#{853}{}{In that case we have nothing to say to each other. Goodbye.}
{853}{}{那样的话，我们就没有什么好说的了。再见。}
#{900}{}{I'm sorry, but that's not enough. Lieutenant Terrak and the likes of him may find breaking rules completely normal, but I am not going to support such behavior. I will not let you enter the City without a proper invitation.}
{900}{}{我很抱歉，但这还不够。泰瑞克中尉和像他这样的人可能会觉得违反规则完全正常，但我不会支持这种行为。没有正式的邀请我是不会让你进城的。}

#{904}{}{Got it. I'll be going now.}

#{1100}{}{In that case, you may not enter the City. Only by obeying the law can we ensure the safety of the dwellers and allow them to work in peace.}
{1100}{}{那样的话，你就不能进城了。只有遵守法律，我们才能确保居民的安全，让他们安心工作。}
#{1101}{}{No need to exaggerate. How much do you want for forgetting about those laws of yours just this once?}
{1101}{}{不必夸大其词。就这一次，你忘了你的那些法律，你想要多少？}
#{1102}{}{Got it. I'm leaving.}
{1102}{}{明白了。我要走了。}
#{1150}{}{I know what you're trying to do. But you cannot bribe an imperial soldier. Without an invitation, you are simply not getting into the City.}
