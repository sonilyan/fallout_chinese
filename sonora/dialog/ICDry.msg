### {230}{}{Who are you? Are you a demon?}
{230}{}{你是谁？你是恶魔吗？}

{231}{}{魔鬼（看向别处）也许是这样…我曾经是一个人。。。我是个农民。我把牛奶倒在地上，以免价格下跌。我把土豆和蔬菜埋在地里。。。真愚蠢。}

### {258}{}{The pack divides the food. You can't survive here alone. And the glowing ones take all the best for themselves. And when there is no food at all, they eat the weakest... like me. I will be eaten, and I will be freed from torment. But I don't want to be eaten. That's why I'm hiding.}
{258}{}{背包把食物分开。你不能一个人在这里生存。发光的人会把最好的都据为己有。当根本没有食物的时候，他们会吃最弱的。。。就像我一样。我会被吃掉，我会从痛苦中解脱出来。但我不想被吃掉。这就是我躲起来的原因。}
### {259}{}{Something is becoming clear to me. But let's change the subject.}

{306}{}{它们被保存在旧教堂里。但是你不能去那里，呵呵。不，不，不要通过！周围有成群的恶魔，没有人知道里面发生了什么。这是一个被诅咒的地方，路西法自己的巢穴。没有人从那里回来。}
