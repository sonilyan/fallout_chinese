### {100}{}{You see Dominguez.}
{100}{}{你看到多明格斯了。}
### {101}{}{Here is a typical peasant.}
{101}{}{这是一个典型的农民。}
### {102}{}{Damn military, you're always armored and fully armed, right?}
{102}{}{该死的军队，你总是全副武装，对吧？}
### {103}{}{Get out before I blow your brains out.}
{103}{}{在我炸掉你的脑袋之前滚出去。}
### {104}{}{The old shoes haven't worn out yet.}
{104}{}{这双旧鞋还没穿破。}
### {105}{}{Sandals made of old rubber? How did I not guess earlier!}
{105}{}{旧橡胶做的凉鞋？我怎么没早点猜到呢！}
### {106}{}{It looks like you've solved Dominguez's old shoe problem. Dominguez is very happy about this.}
{106}{}{看起来你解决了多明格斯的旧鞋问题。多明格斯对此感到非常高兴。}

### {200}{}{Wait. What do you need?}
{200}{}{等待你需要什么？}
### {201}{}{I just want to talk. Why such hostility?}
{201}{}{我只是想谈谈。为什么会有这样的敌意？}
### {202}{}{The military is nearby, but I do not know you. If you're here by chance, you'd better leave.}
{202}{}{军队就在附近，但我不认识你。如果你是偶然来的，你最好离开。}
### {203}{}{I'll do that. I don't want to meet even more resistance from the locals...}
{203}{}{我会那样做的。我不想遇到更多来自当地人的阻力...}
### {204}{}{Would you refuse a favor to a traveler from the north? I just want to ask about this city.}
{204}{}{你会拒绝帮一个来自北方的旅行者的忙吗？我只想问一下这个城市的情况。}
### {205}{}{(raises his gun threateningly) Get off my ranch.}
{205}{}{（威胁地举起枪）滚出我的牧场。}
### {206}{}{Okay, whatever you say...}
{206}{}{好吧，不管你说什么...}
### {207}{}{You'll regret it...}
{207}{}{你会后悔的...}
### {208}{}{You again. I told you to get off my ranch.}
{208}{}{你又来了。我叫你离开我的牧场。}
### {209}{}{Sure, man, no problem.}
{209}{}{当然，伙计，没问题。}

### {210}{}{OK, ask. But after that you will leave.}
{210}{}{好的，问问。但在那之后你就会离开。}
### {211}{}{I'm already leaving, relax.}
{211}{}{我已经走了，放松。}
### {212}{}{Do you live here alone?}
{212}{}{你一个人住在这里吗？}
### {213}{}{No, there are still a few peaceful families in the vicinity. The military does not like civilians under their noses.}
{213}{}{不，附近仍然有一些平静的家庭。军方不喜欢他们眼皮底下的平民。}
### {214}{}{Military? Who are you talking about?}
{214}{}{军事的你在说谁？}
### {215}{}{Don't you know? Further along the main highway, the garrison of the New Mexican Republic is located. Now these lands are under the protection of General Sarabiy.}
{215}{}{你不知道吗？沿着主要公路，新墨西哥共和国的驻军就在这里。现在这些土地都在萨拉比将军的保护之下。}
### {216}{}{So I won't be able to count on my house in these parts?}
{216}{}{所以我不能指望我在这些地方的房子了？}
### {217}{}{You really don't know anything? Listen, the situation in the country is difficult. The president's army is trying to unite disparate lands, and we, simple peaceful peasants, are paying for it. And they didn't even ask us. Therefore, living near the fort is not the best idea. The military does not tolerate self-settlers.}
{217}{}{你真的什么都不知道？听着，这个国家的情况很困难。总统的军队试图团结不同的土地，而我们这些简单和平的农民正在为此付出代价。他们甚至没有要求我们。因此，住在堡垒附近不是最好的主意。军方不容忍自我定居者。}
### {218}{}{And how did you get here?}
{218}{}{你是怎么来的？}
### {219}{}{I had connections. And the fort needs food. My ranch is under the protection of the garrison, although in return I have to give almost all my meat.}
{219}{}{我有关系。堡垒需要食物。我的牧场在驻军的保护下，尽管作为回报，我不得不捐出几乎所有的肉。}
### {220}{}{That's how it is. Thanks for the clarification. I think I should go.}
{220}{}{事情就是这样。谢谢你的澄清。我想我应该走了。}
### {221}{}{Oh, that changes a lot. Perhaps I should retire from here. Urgent.}
{221}{}{哦，变化很大。也许我应该从这里退休。紧急的}
### {222}{}{General Sarabia - what do you know about him?}
{222}{}{萨拉比亚将军，你对他了解多少？}
### {223}{}{Manuel Sarabia. I saw him several times in the motorcade and at general training camps. He's usually at the General Staff at the top of that mountain.}
{223}{}{曼努埃尔・萨拉比亚。我在车队和普通训练营见过他好几次。他通常在山顶的总参谋部。}
### {224}{}{I think I should see him. I hope he has a minute.}
{224}{}{我想我应该去看看他。我希望他有一分钟的时间。}
### {225}{}{Are they allowed to talk to him?}
{225}{}{他们可以和他说话吗？}
### {226}{}{Civilians? No. And I don't really want to face such a person. They say he eats bread by dipping it in the blood of slain enemies.}
{226}{}{平民？不，我真的不想面对这样的人。据说他是把面包蘸在被杀敌人的血里吃的。}
### {227}{}{This general is admirable. I just need to meet him. Bye.}
{227}{}{这位将军令人钦佩。我只需要见见他。再见}
### {228}{}{So it changes things. I think I'd better go somewhere else. Goodbye.}
{228}{}{所以它改变了一切。我想我最好去别的地方。再见}
### {229}{}{And what did you say about the general?}
{229}{}{你对将军说了什么？}
### {230}{}{Are you aware of this army's plans for Arizona?}
{230}{}{你知道这支军队对亚利桑那州的计划吗？}
### {231}{}{I doubt the garrison is going to Arizona anytime soon. To do this, it is necessary to overcome a huge barren desert, and for a long time we even believed that there was no life in the north. But if the government orders it, the army will go.}
{231}{}{我怀疑驻军是否会很快前往亚利桑那州。要做到这一点，就必须克服一片巨大的贫瘠沙漠，在很长一段时间里，我们甚至认为北方没有生命。但如果政府下令，军队就会离开。}
### {232}{}{Thank you, it was valuable information. I think I need to do something. Later.}
{232}{}{谢谢你，这是很有价值的信息。我想我需要做点什么。后来}
### {233}{}{Maybe you've heard about his army's plans for Arizona?}
{233}{}{也许你听说过他的军队对亚利桑那州的计划？}
### {234}{}{Do you know General Sarabia's plans for Arizona?}
{234}{}{你知道萨拉比亚将军对亚利桑那州的计划吗？}
### {235}{}{OK, ask.}
{235}{}{好的，问问。}
### {236}{}{Of course, ask.}
{236}{}{当然，问问吧。}
### {237}{}{I'm just a peaceful wanderer and I don't want to hurt you. Let's talk, amigo?}
{237}{}{我只是一个平和的流浪者，我不想伤害你。我们谈谈吧，朋友？}

### {238}{}{Thanks for the radio. He embellishes our gray everyday life at least a little.}
{238}{}{谢谢你的收音机。他至少稍微美化了我们灰色的日常生活。}
### {239}{}{Can I talk to you?}
{239}{}{我能和你谈谈吗？}

### {240}{}{Do you know old Gallegos? He came to the north from these parts.}
{240}{}{你认识老加列戈斯吗？他是从这些地方来到北方的。}
### {241}{}{Do you know Gallegos? What a surprise. So he managed to cross the desert. I thought this crazy idea was tantamount to suicide.}
{241}{}{你认识加列戈斯吗？真是个惊喜。于是他设法穿越了沙漠。我以为这个疯狂的想法等于自杀。}
### {242}{}{Of the entire group, only he survived. So you were almost right.}
{242}{}{在整个小组中，只有他活了下来。所以你几乎是对的。}
### {243}{}{Gallegos and the others had a desperate situation. The new government and troops oppressed the peasants. People like me are lucky, but many work like slaves. Running north seemed like the only solution.}
{243}{}{加列戈斯和其他人陷入了绝境。新政府和军队压迫农民。像我这样的人很幸运，但很多人都像奴隶一样工作。北上似乎是唯一的解决办法。}
### {244}{}{However, judging by his condition, he had wasted all his health along the way.}
{244}{}{然而，从他的情况来看，一路上他浪费了所有的健康。}
### {245}{}{I can imagine what he had to go through in this hot desert. Although the old man was a traitor to the country, he showed us an example of will and perseverance. Thank you, I was glad to hear the news about an old friend. And my friends' friends are also my friends.}
{245}{}{我可以想象他在这炎热的沙漠里所经历的一切。尽管这位老人是国家的叛徒，但他向我们展示了意志和毅力的榜样。谢谢你，我很高兴听到一个老朋友的消息。我朋友的朋友也是我的朋友。}
### {246}{}{Please.}
{246}{}{请}
### {247}{}{Old Gallegos was talking about the Dominguez ranch. He said he was a good and honest man who would not refuse a traveler a glass of water.}
{247}{}{老加列戈斯在谈论多明格斯牧场。他说他是一个善良诚实的人，不会拒绝旅行者一杯水。}

### {250}{}{Where did you get the Brahmins?}
{250}{}{你从哪里得到婆罗门的？}
### {251}{}{Brahmins? What is it?}
{251}{}{婆罗门？它是什么？}
### {252}{}{Your animals are on the ranch.}
{252}{}{你的动物在牧场上。}
### {253}{}{Do you know the name of your cattle? It's ridiculous.}
{253}{}{你知道你的牛叫什么名字吗？这太荒谬了。}
### {254}{}{Ah, waki. You Northerners always complicate things. I bought this animal young from the military after their raid for the vaks. They used to get their meat this way, now they take it from me. In a sense, this is a loan for which I pay with provisions.}
{254}{}{啊，waki。你们北方人总是把事情搞复杂。在军队突袭瓦克斯后，我从他们那里买了这只小动物。他们过去是这样吃肉的，现在他们从我这里拿走了。从某种意义上说，这是一笔我用准备金支付的贷款。}
### {255}{}{Can I ask another question?}
{255}{}{我可以再问一个问题吗？}
### {256}{}{I was just curious. Later.}
{256}{}{我只是好奇。后来}
### {257}{}{I have been to San Brahmin. The locals revered these animals as sacred.}
{257}{}{我去过圣婆罗门。当地人把这些动物尊为神圣之物。}
### {258}{}{Holy Brahmin? I've never heard of it. I think it's stupid.}
{258}{}{神圣的婆罗门？我从来没听说过。我觉得这很愚蠢。}
### {259}{}{Perhaps. But for them it was a matter of survival.}
{259}{}{可能但对他们来说，这是关乎生存的问题。}
### {260}{}{To the point. It's the stupidest thing I've ever seen.}
{260}{}{切中要害。这是我见过的最愚蠢的事。}
### {261}{}{Your questions are tiring. I have to mind my own business.}
{261}{}{你的问题太累了。我得管好自己的事。}
### {262}{}{I'm leaving now, don't worry.}
{262}{}{我现在要走了，别担心。}

### {270}{}{You were talking about the difficult situation in Mexico. What's the matter?}
{270}{}{你说的是墨西哥的困难局势。怎么了？}
### {271}{}{Yes. You see, during La Gran Guerra, our capital was destroyed, as a result of which many provinces gained independence. Most of them got a small army and defended their borders.}
{271}{}{对你看，在La Gran Guerra期间，我们的首都被摧毁，许多省份因此获得独立。他们中的大多数人组建了一支小型军队，保卫自己的边界。}
### {272}{}{Go on.}
{272}{}{继续}
### {273}{}{No need for details. The overall picture is already clear.}
{273}{}{无需详细信息。总体情况已经很清楚了。}
### {274}{}{I know a little myself. But they say that the northern states have been seized by gangster cartels that in the past traded in weapons, drugs and people. Having lost their business, they took up the defense of their territories. Now it is the private property of their descendants.}
{274}{}{我自己也知道一点。但他们表示，北方各州已被过去进行武器、毒品和人员交易的黑帮卡特尔占领。他们失去了生意，开始保卫自己的领土。现在它是他们后代的私有财产。}
### {275}{}{The rest of the country?}
{275}{}{全国其他地方？}
### {276}{}{It was especially difficult in the south of the country, where the nationalists divided the territory into separate small states. Yucatan, Chiapas, Tabasco and Guerrero are still arguing who is in charge.}
{276}{}{这在该国南部尤其困难，那里的民族主义者将领土划分为单独的小国。尤卡坦、恰帕斯、塔巴斯科和格雷罗仍在争论谁是负责人。}
### {277}{}{It's all history. And how are things now?}
{277}{}{这都是历史。现在情况如何？}
### {278}{}{Everything changed with the coming to power of the new president. He gathered a strong army and subdued all the central states from Durango to Veracruz. Right now he is fighting fierce battles east of the isthmus of Tehuantepec. The local tribes are too proud, so this war will last for many years. The northern states are also gradually losing ground.}
{278}{}{随着新总统的上台，一切都变了。他召集了一支强大的军队，征服了从杜兰戈到韦拉克鲁斯的所有中部各州。现在，他正在特万特佩克地峡以东进行激战。当地部落太骄傲了，所以这场战争将持续很多年。北方各州也在逐渐失去优势。}
### {279}{}{Thanks for the story.}
{279}{}{谢谢你的故事。}
### {280}{}{De nada. It is my joy to share the history of my people with people like you. Who knows, maybe your ancestors also came from Mexico once.}
{280}{}{德纳达。我很高兴能和你们这样的人分享我的人民的历史。谁知道呢，也许你的祖先也曾经来自墨西哥。}
### {281}{}{Listen, you tell a lot of interesting things. Will you give me some more time?}
{281}{}{听着，你讲了很多有趣的事情。你能再给我一些时间吗？}
### {282}{}{Okay, Dominguez. Bye.}
{282}{}{好吧，多明格斯。再见}
