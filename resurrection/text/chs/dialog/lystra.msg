#{255}{}{Lystra's obviously tired of waiting.}

#{315}{}{Bad idea. Lystra won't let you do that.}
{315}{}{坏主意。莱斯特拉不会让你这么做的。}
#{316}{}{::She whispers, scared.:: You're out of your mind. I'm not leaving this place until you get rid of that floater. As a matter of fact, I won't move an inch any further. That'll be for the best.}

#{318}{}{I won't let you harm the people of the empire!}
{318}{}{我不会让你伤害帝国人民的！}
#{319}{}{You're every bit as disgusting as that monster Chuck. I won't let you murder innocent children. I'll stop you whatever the cost.}
{319}{}{你跟那个怪物查克一样恶心。我不会让你谋杀无辜的孩子。我会不惜一切代价阻止你。}
#{320}{}{Noo!}
{320}{}{不！}
#{321}{}{You... I won't let them drag me away without a fight. You were wrong if you counted on it.}

#{322}{}{You... I won't let them drag me away without a fight. You were wrong if you counted on it.}
{322}{}{你。。。我不会让他们不打一架就把我拖走的。如果你指望它，那你就错了。}
#{323}{}{The base will be destroyed, great. But we must escape it before that happens.}
{323}{}{基地会被摧毁的，太好了。但我们必须在那之前逃离它。}
#{324}{}{This is madness! You can't be serious! I'll stop you even if it means I have to kill you.}
{324}{}{这太疯狂了！你不是认真的吧！我会阻止你，即使这意味着我必须杀了你。}
#{325}{}{God... What other perverse lunacies shall we witness here...}
{325}{}{上帝啊。。。在这里我们还能看到什么变态的疯子。。。}

#{328}{}{But I can't just stand aside. I'm sorry, }
{328}{}{但我不能袖手旁观。我很抱歉，}
#{329}{}{.}
{329}{}{.}
#{330}{}{I'm seriously wounded. If we don't do something about it, I might even die.}
{330}{}{我受了重伤。如果我们不采取措施，我甚至可能会死。}
#{331}{}{We should pay attention to my bleeding. I direly need to be treated.}
{331}{}{我们应该注意我的出血。我真的需要治疗。}
#{332}{}{I'm used to blood, but in smaller amounts and not mine.}
{332}{}{我习惯用血，但量少，不是我的。}
#{333}{}{I direly need to be treated. I can't work miracles without equipment, I need a stimpak.}

Nevertheless, I'm not going with you anywhere until you sleep it off.}

{1002}{}{是的，我好多了，我们可以继续。}
#{1050}{}{Good. But, fully aware of the fact that I'll sound prissy, I have to tell you to be careful about what you eat or get into your body. That is even more true about things from the wasteland or bought from someone untrustworthy, which is just about everything you can get your hands on.}
{1050}{}{很好。但是，充分意识到这一点，我会听起来百里茜，我必须告诉你小心你吃什么或进入你的身体。从荒地买来的东西或者从不值得信任的人那里买来的东西更是如此，这些东西几乎都是你能得到的。}

#{1102}{}{You just don't want to see what one must do to survive in the wastes. You don't have the guts for it. I'll leave you here, if that's what you want. Maybe you'll change your mind once you're left to your own devices.}

#{1750}{}{No need to worry. I take my equipment very seriously. I have prepared items necessary for a long journey in the wastes.}
{1750}{}{不用担心。我非常重视我的设备。我已经准备好了在荒野中长途旅行所需的物品。}
#{1751}{}{What can you do?}
{1751}{}{你能做什么？}
#{1752}{}{Holster your weapon.}
{1752}{}{把你的枪套起来。}
#{1753}{}{I want to talk about the armor you're wearing.}
{1753}{}{我想谈谈你穿的盔甲。}
#{1754}{}{In fact, I need something else from you.}
{1754}{}{事实上，我还需要你做点别的。}
#{1800}{}{I've never been in a fight, if that's what you're asking. I've only taken elementary training with energy weapons. Mostly with pistols, to be more specific. Given how small and light they are, they're capable of causing quite ugly wounds. But I'm a doctor first of all, I've spent most of my life studying medicine. In the empire, we possess medical knowledge that has been long forgotten elsewhere, regrettably.}
{1800}{}{我从来没打过架，如果你是问这个的话。我只接受过能量武器的初级训练。更具体地说，主要是用手枪。考虑到它们又小又轻，它们能造成相当难看的伤口。但我首先是个医生，我花了大半辈子学习医学。遗憾的是，在帝国，我们拥有的医学知识早已被其他地方遗忘。}

#{1804}{}{Thanks for clarification, that's all for now.}

#{1850}{}{Of course, I understand. We don't want to appear hostile and create a conflict that could've been avoided.}
{1850}{}{当然，我明白。我们不想表现出敌意，制造本来可以避免的冲突。}
#{1851}{}{What can you do?}
{1851}{}{你能做什么？}
#{1852}{}{I want to talk about the armor you're wearing.}
{1852}{}{我想谈谈你穿的盔甲。}
#{1853}{}{In fact, I need something else from you.}
{1853}{}{事实上，我还需要你做点别的。}
#{1854}{}{Fine, thanks.}
{1854}{}{很好，谢谢。}
#{1900}{}{The thing I'm wearing may look like a standard piece of metal armor at first glance, but if you step in and take a closer look, you'll find out that it has been enhanced with nomex and kevlar from the inside. I wouldn't feel safe with any inferior armor. I shouldn't take it off in any circumstances, but if you happen to run into something better, I'm willing to give it a try. Or if we need to use guise, I'd be willing to wear a robe.}
{1900}{}{我穿的这件衣服乍一看可能像一件标准的金属盔甲，但如果你走进来仔细看看，你会发现它已经从内部增强了nomex和kevlar。穿上劣质的盔甲我不会感到安全。我在任何情况下都不该脱，但如果你碰巧遇到更好的，我愿意试一试。如果我们需要伪装，我愿意穿长袍。}

{1901}{}{很好，我明白。我们来讨论一下。}
#{1920}{}{I wouldn't feel safe in any armor inferior to the imperial metal armor with nomex-kevlar fiber. I shouldn't take it off in any circumstances when I'm outside the City. But I'm willing to give a try to some other armor if it seems better, or even a good robe if we need to use guise.}
{1920}{}{我不会觉得安全，在任何装甲不如帝国金属装甲与诺美克斯凯夫拉纤维。我在城外的任何情况下都不该脱。但如果它看起来更好的话，我愿意试试其他的盔甲，如果我们需要伪装的话，我甚至愿意尝试一件好的长袍。}

{1921}{}{很好，我明白。那我们来谈谈你的盔甲吧。}

#{2055}{}{It is. Thanks.}
{2055}{}{它是。谢谢。}
#{2100}{}{All I know about Sedit is what my ears caught in the Suburbs of Albuquerque. It's a business hub of the whole area, though I doubt honest business is all the place is about. We should be careful.}
{2100}{}{我只知道塞迪特是我在阿尔伯克基郊区听到的。它是整个地区的商业中心，尽管我怀疑诚实的商业是这里的全部。我们应该小心。}

#{2152}{}{Thanks for the info.}
{2152}{}{谢谢你的信息。}
#{2200}{}{The Mutant Hunters don't share their plans with anybody, so lots of people in Albuquerque don't even know about the existence of this base, let alone its location. I have a suspicion their intention was to have a post away from anybody's eyes. It is strange that it was their base in particular that fell to the supermutants. But I guess that somehow they asked for it. However awful that must sound.}
{2200}{}{变种猎人不会和任何人分享他们的计划，所以阿尔伯克基的很多人甚至不知道这个基地的存在，更不用说它的位置了。我怀疑他们的意图是想让一个职位远离任何人的视线。奇怪的是，正是它们的基地落入了超级变种人的手中。但我想他们一定是自找的。不管那听起来多么可怕。}

#{2250}{}{This is an amazing place. A multi-storied fully preserved pre-war facility... Have you noticed those symbols? This was a joint venture of Vault-Tec and the government of the United States.

{2250}{}{这是个很棒的地方。一个保存完好的多层战前设施。。。你注意到那些符号了吗？这是Vault Tec和美国政府的合资企业。我毫不怀疑，这个地方充满了许多无价的技术和过去时代的知识。我对所有这些都掌握在重生手中的感觉不太好。}

Curiosity got the best of me, I have to admit. And then when I went looking for Sindian. So I know a little bit about the rest of Albuquerque as well.}
{2300}{}{这就是我的家，我一生都在这里度过。当然是皇城内部，更具体地说。但我也去过几次。我不得不承认，好奇心压倒了我。当我去找辛迪安的时候。所以我对阿尔伯克基的其他地方也略知一二。}

{2305}{}{我需要你给我点别的东西。}
#{2306}{}{That's enough, thanks.}
{2306}{}{够了，谢谢。}
#{2350}{}{The empire is the result of the resettlement of the surface after the Vault opened. To summarize, and that really is a very dense summary, you could say the empire is trying to preserve civilization while at the same time the quality of life for its dwellers on the level known from before the war. I know this sounds pompous, but there are values and knowledge worth preserving and they would have disappeared a long time ago were it not for the empire. Unfortunately, in order to preserve them, they cannot be spread further. That is why the City remains closed to strangers. Well, that is one of the reasons. Hopefully a change will be possible in the future. I certainly hope that is what will happen.}
{2350}{}{帝国是金库开放后重新安置地面的结果。总而言之，这确实是一个非常密集的总结，你可以说帝国在努力维护文明的同时，其居民的生活质量达到了战前的水平。我知道这听起来很浮夸，但有价值观和知识值得保存，如果不是为了帝国，它们早就消失了。不幸的是，为了保存它们，它们不能进一步传播。这就是为什么这座城市仍然对陌生人不开放。嗯，这就是原因之一。希望将来能有所改变。我当然希望这会发生。}

#{2400}{}{The Suburbs is the place where the greatest number of immigrants and refugees escaping from the Rebirth group up. There are so many different factions here that it inevitably leads to conflicts. People from various small towns, who have lost everything and their dear ones, quite understandably consider it a problem to be living right next to savages who are clearly not used to living in these circumstances. And from what I heard, there is also a small but very brutal gang exerting their influence here.}
{2400}{}{郊区是逃离重生群体的移民和难民最多的地方。这里的派系太多了，难免会引起冲突。来自各个小镇的人们，他们失去了一切和他们的亲人，可以理解的是，他们认为与那些显然不习惯在这种情况下生活的野蛮人住在一起是一个问题。据我所知，还有一个很小但很残忍的团伙在这里施加影响。}

#{2450}{}{That name is a paradox. The whole of Albuquerque with the exception of the City is practically the Hunters' territory. The area was given the name because of the base the Hunters have built there. There's also a place here called the Wild Paradise. Lots of Hunters and others tend to group there. I think common immigrants avoid this part of Albuquerque in order to avoid catching the attention of the Hunters.}
{2450}{}{这个名字是个悖论。整个阿尔伯克基除了城市外，几乎都是猎人的领地。这个地区之所以被命名是因为猎人们在那里建立了基地。这里还有一个地方叫野生天堂。许多猎人和其他人倾向于聚集在那里。我认为普通移民避开阿尔伯克基的这一部分是为了避免引起猎人的注意。}

#{2500}{}{It didn't use to be such a devastated place. At least that is how I heard it from other people's descriptions. I was practically a child when the Rebirth destroyed this part of Albuquerque in their attack. Now it's a place of gathering for the biggest wretches - people who have literally nothing, and drug addicts. And in the midst of it all stands a hospital. They are arrogant enough to call it that, but they have no idea what medical ethics is... I don't even want to begin this discussion.}

#{2700}{}{Have you gone insane?! You are a bloodthirsty lunatic! That man was my only lead to Sindian! Now I may never find him again. I should have thought it through better before joining a stranger. I don't want to see you ever again!}
{2700}{}{你疯了吗？！你是个嗜血的疯子！那个人是我找到辛迪安的唯一线索！现在我可能再也找不到他了。在加入一个陌生人之前，我应该好好考虑一下。我不想再见到你了！}

#{2702}{}{Whatever. Go if you want, I don't give a damn about you.}
{2702}{}{无论什么。你想走就走，我才不管你呢。}
#{2703}{}{Bye-bye.}
{2703}{}{再见。}
#{2750}{}{Yes, I believe what Falcon said is true. I'd like to go there as soon as possible, I don't want to postpone the journey more than is necessary. Sindian might not have stayed in Corath, but hopefully we'll find some information about him. Perhaps someone will tell us what to do next. As far as I know, there are no Mutant Hunters in Corath, so he wouldn't have to be in hiding there.}
{2750}{}{是的，我相信法尔肯说的是真的。我想尽快去那里，我不想把行程推迟得太多。辛迪安可能没有留在科拉斯，但希望我们能找到一些关于他的信息。也许有人会告诉我们下一步该做什么。据我所知，科拉斯没有变种猎人，所以他不必躲在那里。}
#{2751}{}{What happened to the family that Sindian rescued?}
{2751}{}{辛典救出的那家人怎么了？}
#{2752}{}{We'll decide what to do next when we get to Corath.}
{2752}{}{我们到科拉斯后再决定下一步怎么办。}
#{2800}{}{You know well how difficult it's for a stranger to get into the empire, which is understandable. It is not any easier to get a simple message to us. When I found out about them, it was too late. The sick family didn't have any other option but to seek help in the hospital. The so called doctors let them die, because they had nothing to pay with. And then they used their organs. I don't even know what happened to the children. My brother risked his life to save those people from the Hunters only so they would die in the hospital. Things like that can really make me angry! Such injustice. I have tried to find support in the City to do something about the hospital, but they either didn't believe me or simply showed no interest.}
{2800}{}{你很清楚一个陌生人进入帝国有多难，这是可以理解的。向我们传达一个简单的信息并不容易。当我发现他们的时候，已经太晚了。这个生病的家庭别无选择，只能到医院寻求帮助。所谓的医生让他们死了，因为他们没有钱支付。然后他们用自己的器官。我都不知道孩子们怎么了。我哥哥冒着生命危险把那些人从猎人手中救出来，只是为了让他们死在医院里。那样的事情真的会让我生气！这样的不公正。我曾试图在城里寻求支持，为医院做些什么，但他们要么不相信我，要么就是根本不感兴趣。}
#{2801}{}{I'm sorry to hear that. We leave for Corath as soon as possible. We'll see what to do next once we get there.}
{2801}{}{听到这个消息我很难过。我们尽快动身去科拉斯。我们一到那儿就看看下一步怎么办。}
#{2850}{}{Difficult to say. Corath is not a big town, but it's big enough for one man to disappear here. Sindian might not even be here anymore. We'll try and ask people. Doctor Linsday should work here. At least I hope he is still here. As a doctor, he should have an overview of the locals.}
{2850}{}{很难说。科拉斯不是一个大城市，但它大到足以让一个人在这里消失。辛迪安可能已经不在这里了。我们会试着问问别人。林斯戴医生应该在这里工作。至少我希望他还在这里。作为一名医生，他应该对当地人有一个全面的了解。}
#{2851}{}{Difficult to say. Corath is not a big town, but it's big enough for one man to disappear here. Sindian might not even be here anymore. We'll try and ask people. Doctor Linsday might know something. As a doctor, he should have an overview of the locals.}

#{2854}{}{OK, we can go see him.}
{2854}{}{好的，我们可以去看他。}
#{2900}{}{In fact, it was he who helped me find the family saved by Sindian in the Dead Quarter hospital. Linsday is a good man, he had no idea what went on in the hospital. That is why he left once he found out the truth. I know he decided to come here, because people said there was no doctor here. I'm curious to find out about how he is doing.}
{2900}{}{事实上，是他帮我在死区医院找到辛典救下的家人。林斯戴是个好人，他不知道医院里发生了什么事。这就是他一发现真相就离开的原因。我知道他决定来这里，因为人们说这里没有医生。我很想知道他现在怎么样。}

#{3000}{}{[Lystra's mournful face bears signs of crying.] I... I still cannot completely believe it. I have always believed my brother could always succeed. I believed he could always manage.

{3050}{}{可怕的。我没想到会这样。。。但至少现在我们可以继续前进了，我不会再阻碍我们了。不过，我想请你帮个忙。我想去参观辛甸的坟墓。我听说林斯戴医生告诉你了。我想跟他说再见。}

#{3103}{}{Ook.}
{3103}{}{哦。}
#{3150}{}{Even here in Corath Sindian was doing everything for the empire. I think he was trying to collect as much information on the Rebirth as possible. Their weaknesses, how to stop them, maybe he was searching for their base. It might be he even found out something. I said I would help you if you help me. I intend to fulfill that promise. Even more since I want to find the Rebirth and stop them just like you, if it's possible. That is what my brother wanted. We'll finish together what he was striving for.}
{3150}{}{即使在科拉辛迪亚这里，也为帝国做了一切。我想他是想收集尽可能多的关于重生的信息。他们的弱点，如何阻止他们，也许他在寻找他们的基地。也许他发现了什么。我说过如果你帮我我会帮你的。我打算履行这个承诺。更重要的是，如果可能的话，我想找到重生，像你一样阻止他们。那是我哥哥想要的。我们将一起完成他所追求的。}

{3401}{}{什么是小药剂师？}
#{3450}{}{I see, so I'm the only one who doesn't find this business normal. Oh well. Little chemist is an education tool created to teach children the basics of chemistry in an entertaining way. I could get you a kit in the City. It is never too late to start learning.}

{4000}{}{你来了！我很担心你。当那东西倒塌的时候，我找不到任何办法进去，所以我去四处看看。我遇见你真是个幸运的巧合。你还好吗，你受伤了吗？}
#{4001}{}{Nothing worth mentioning. But you could've shown up earlier. I could have used your help in a fight with an infuriated deathclaw.}
{4001}{}{没什么值得一提的。但你本可以早点出现的。我本可以利用你的帮助和一只愤怒的死爪搏斗的。}
#{4002}{}{Deathclaw there! Lystra nowhere!}
{4002}{}{死爪在那里！莱斯特拉哪儿都没有！}
#{4050}{}{A fight with a deathclaw? I know you well enough to know that is how you imagine a fun time, right? No, seriously, I'm glad you're fine.}

#{4051}{}{We're moving on, let's not waste any more time here.}
{4051}{}{我们继续，别再浪费时间了。}

#{4150}{}{A lot of people are moving into the Suburbs of Albuquerque fleeing from the Rebirth. Inevitably, there will be those among them who will use the suffering of others for their own benefit.

#{4154}{}{Thanks for the info. I'll see what we can do.}
{4154}{}{谢谢你的信息。我看看我们能做些什么。}
#{4200}{}{That is a good question. Unfortunately, the other immigrants are afraid of him, and all the Hunters are interested in are people with signs of mutation. But the Hunters would not like if the imperial army carried out an operation in the Suburbs. I wish that was the only reason. The City has tuned out the outside world so much nobody cares about what happens outside. Our army could easily interfere and it would cost us almost nothing. That is not the same thing as opening up to the whole world. It would just mean helping people who live right outside our gates. But as you probably can guess, there aren't many people within the City who share my opinion.}
{4200}{}{这是个好问题。不幸的是，其他移民都害怕他，所有的猎人都对有变异迹象的人感兴趣。但是猎人们不愿意帝国军队在郊区进行行动。我希望这是唯一的原因。这座城市对外面的世界置若罔闻，所以没人关心外面发生了什么。我们的军队可以很容易地进行干预，这几乎不需要我们付出任何代价。这和向全世界开放不是一回事。这只意味着帮助那些住在我们门外的人。但正如你可能猜到的，城市里没有多少人同意我的观点。}
#{4201}{}{I have another question.}
{4201}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{4202}{}{Thanks for the info.}
{4202}{}{谢谢你的信息。}
#{4250}{}{Yes, helping him was the right thing to do. It feels good, does it not? I'm glad we did it. Sheriff Carpenter is not the most pleasant man I know, but that doesn't mean his innocent son should suffer. Let's hope he will be alright after everything he's experienced.}
{4250}{}{是的，帮助他是正确的。感觉很好，不是吗？我很高兴我们做到了。卡彭特警长不是我认识的最讨人喜欢的人，但这并不意味着他无辜的儿子应该受苦。希望他在经历了一切之后一切都会好起来。}

#{4300}{}{Vex is the worst of all the criminals who've settled in the Suburbs. He abuses and exploits all the other immigrants. It goes without saying I don't want you to work for a man like him. And I, for one, won't. If you do what he asks you to do, I'm finished with you.}

#{4450}{}{I'm glad their business will no longer continue. I just wish the price for it wasn't all that bloodshed.

[She sighs.] Justice is a really dirty business in the wasteland.}
{4450}{}{我很高兴他们的生意不再继续了。我只希望代价不是流血。这么多人死了，他们中的许多人都是非常熟练的医生，如果他们选择这样的话，他们真的可以拯救生命。。。[她叹了口气]在荒地里，正义真是一件肮脏的事。}

#{4452}{}{Sadly, that's how it works everywhere.}
{4452}{}{可悲的是，到处都是这样。}
#{4500}{}{The fact that they call it a hospital and refer to themselves as doctors is an insult to the medical profession. They only treat those who pay them sufficiently and kill the poor! I have tried to convince several people in our City to do something about it, but I had no success. They are still in the Dead Quarter and they even prosper.}
{4500}{}{他们称之为医院，自称医生，这是对医学界的侮辱。他们只对待那些付够钱的人，而杀害穷人！我曾试图说服我们城里的几个人对此做些什么，但没有成功。他们仍在死角，甚至还兴旺发达。}

{4502}{}{我明白你不同意他们的做法。}
#{4550}{}{If you want to work for that so-called hospital, you'll have to do it without me. I don't agree with what they do. No one sensible can. They don't help people. On the contrary. Goodbye, I'm sorry I was wrong about you.}

#{4552}{}{Ook.}
{4552}{}{哦。}
#{4600}{}{Yes, I do. And honestly, if you really join them, I'll no longer travel with you. I'm sorry, but I would not feel comfortable with a Mutant Hunter.

{4600}{}{是的，我知道。老实说，如果你真的加入他们，我就不再和你一起旅行了。我很抱歉，但是我觉得和一个变种猎人在一起很不舒服。我并不是说每一个猎人都是天生的坏人。你的动机也许是好的，我哥哥也这么看，但我不相信猎人们的全部命令。}

#{4603}{}{Thanks for the warning.}
{4603}{}{谢谢你的警告。}
#{4650}{}{It is more complicated. They seek to acquire all our technologies, especially those related to weapons. They claim that they want them due to their fight with the Rebirth. And even though that might actually be true, it would be very risky for the empire to provide them weapons they could effectively use against us. The advisers believe they would not hesitate. But on the other hand, they're the main thing standing between us and the Rebirth. That is why they're required and why the agreements are still in effect. As far as the ordinary dwellers go, they simply see Hunters as another group of people from the wastes, who, in addition, are heavily armed and aggressive.}
{4650}{}{它更复杂。他们寻求获得我们的所有技术，特别是与武器有关的技术。他们声称他们想要他们是因为他们与重生的斗争。尽管这可能是真的，但帝国向他们提供可以有效对付我们的武器是非常危险的。顾问们相信他们会毫不犹豫的。但另一方面，他们是我们和重生之间的主要障碍。这就是为什么他们是必需的，为什么协议仍然有效。就普通居民而言，他们只是把猎人看作是来自荒野的另一群人，此外，他们全副武装，咄咄逼人。}

{4651}{}{你的意见是什么？}
#{4652}{}{I have another question.}

{4653}{}{我现在更清楚一点了。谢谢你的澄清。}
#{4700}{}{When Sindian had to leave the Hunters, I tried to find out what happened. I learned a few things about the Hunters and they were not pretty. They abuse their predominance over the rest of the people in Albuquerque. They might be effective fighting the ghouls from the Rebirth, but they're just as ruthless when it comes to others. I fear the ultimate goal of the Hunters is not a world without mutants. They strive for a world without anyone who doesn't share their beliefs.}
{4700}{}{当辛迪安不得不离开猎人时，我试图找出发生了什么事。我了解了一些关于猎人的事情，他们并不漂亮。他们滥用对阿尔伯克基其他人的支配地位。他们也许能有效地对抗重生后的僵尸，但对其他人来说，他们同样无情。我担心猎人的最终目标不是一个没有变种的世界。他们为一个没有任何人不认同他们信仰的世界而奋斗。}

#{4702}{}{I appreciate you shared this with me.}
{4702}{}{我很感激你和我分享这个。}
#{4750}{}{People don't disappear in the City, it's not the wasteland. It might be Felix is hiding somewhere. Admission into the imperial army is a great honor even for children so small. Maybe he is ashamed of returning home. Colonel Browman has already said to Mrs. Velasquez that he knows nothing, but he might recollect something new. I have no idea where else to start searching.}
{4750}{}{人们不会消失在城市里，那不是荒地。可能是费利克斯藏在什么地方。即使对这么小的孩子来说，入伍也是一种莫大的荣誉。也许他为回家感到羞耻。布劳曼上校已经对贝拉斯克斯太太说，他什么都不知道，但他可能会想起一些新的东西。我不知道还能从哪里开始搜索。}

{4753}{}{谢谢你的建议，看来这是我们唯一的线索。}
#{4800}{}{Not much. I don't know him personally, really. I know he was wounded in the battles with the Rebirth during their second large attack on Albuquerque. He was entrusted with recruitment on account of his injury and his speckless records. I have no doubt he took up the task with great responsibility. He is an officer of the imperial army. There is no reason to doubt him.}
{4800}{}{不多。我不认识他，真的。我知道他是在与重生的战斗中受伤的，在他们对阿尔伯克基的第二次大规模进攻中。他因受伤和无记录而被委托征兵。我毫不怀疑他以极大的责任承担了这项任务。他是帝国军队的军官。没有理由怀疑他。}

{5000}{}{查克是个恶心的动物。你不能真的有不同的意见。我很难相信皇军的一位上校和他一起工作。这是对军队和帝国信仰的不可饶恕的玷污。}
#{5001}{}{ We have to stop Chuck. I never thought I would want to kill somebody, but this has got to stop. He mustn't get other children, even if I have to shoot him myself. Damn it!

{5001}{}{我们必须阻止查克。我从没想过我会杀人，但这必须停止。他不能再生别的孩子了，即使我要亲自杀了他。该死的！[莱斯特拉愤怒地向空中尖叫]这个世界到底怎么了？！也许他们说的是真的。也许我们应该把这座城市与外界隔绝，停止一切通讯。}

#{5403}{}{Good luck explaining why that boy has a gun so he can kill his own parents, and why you just stood by and watched me give it to him. Or do you want to use violence and take it from him? That won't look too good. Do whatever you want. Goodbye, Lystra.}
{5403}{}{祝你好运解释为什么那个男孩有枪，这样他就可以杀死自己的父母，为什么你只是站在一旁看着我把枪给他。还是你想用暴力从他那里夺走？那看起来不太好。你想干什么就干什么。再见，莱斯特拉。}
#{5404}{}{Bye-bye, Lystra.}
{5404}{}{再见，莱斯特拉。}
#{5450}{}{It doesn't surprise me the army is trying to get their hands on him. On the other hand, the rest of it does sound like nonsense. I would really like to know what is going on here. We should not help him, but we can go look into his apartment, maybe we'll find some answers there.}
{5450}{}{我一点也不奇怪军队想抓住他。另一方面，其余的听起来确实像是胡说八道。我真的很想知道这里发生了什么。我们不应该帮助他，但我们可以去看看他的公寓，也许我们会在那里找到一些答案。}
#{5451}{}{I have another question.}
{5451}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{5452}{}{You're right, it's worth checking out.}
{5452}{}{你说得对，值得一看。}
#{5500}{}{It does strike me as strange that I haven't heard anything about it. Imperial dwellers normally don't kill each other, we value life. But I haven't been myself lately. I was occupied taking care of the inheritance left by my father, so I'm not up to date regarding the latest developments. It is also understandable that the imperial army is trying not to disseminate the news about one dweller killing another dweller. Nevertheless, there is no reason to distrust what private Sneed said. It certainly makes better sense than Cole's story.}
{5500}{}{我真奇怪，我什么都没听说过。帝国居民通常不会互相残杀，我们珍视生命。但我最近不太好。我忙于照顾我父亲留下的遗产，所以我不了解最新进展。同样可以理解的是，帝国军队试图不传播一个居民杀害另一个居民的消息。然而，没有理由不相信斯内德所说的话。这当然比科尔的故事更有意义。}
#{5501}{}{I have another question.}
{5501}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{5502}{}{Hm, let me think about it a bit more.}
{5502}{}{嗯，让我再考虑一下。}
#{5550}{}{Definitely good news. I'm just sorry it had to end by killing him in the street. That is not how we usually take care of things, it's the way of the world outside the City. There should have been a proper court trial and a verdict. That doesn't mean you acted wrongfully. On the contrary, I thank you for helping in apprehending him. Cole simply didn't leave us a choice.}
{5550}{}{绝对是个好消息。我只是很抱歉最后在街上杀了他。这不是我们通常处理事情的方式，而是城市之外的世界的方式。应该有一个适当的法庭审判和判决。那并不意味着你做得不对。相反，我感谢你帮助逮捕他。科尔没有给我们留下选择。}

{5553}{}{我很高兴在这件事上我们站在同一边。}
#{5600}{}{What are you doing?! You cannot simply attack imperial soldiers. I won't let you do that. If you believe you're doing a good thing in helping Cole, I certainly don't. He is a murderer and now you're his accomplice.}
{5600}{}{你在做什么？你不能简单地攻击帝国士兵。我不会让你那样做的。如果你相信你在帮助科尔方面做了一件好事，我当然不会。他是个杀人犯，现在你是他的同谋。}
#{5601}{}{Too late. What're you going to do about it?}
{5601}{}{太晚了。你打算怎么办？}
#{5602}{}{Huh, wot?!}
{5602}{}{哈，哇？！}
#{5650}{}{You've aided a murderer and I'm convinced he was one, whatever he said. So what do you think? At least you didn't hurt anybody in the process. And maybe trying to survive outside the City will be a greater punishment for Cole than an execution. But please, try to act more reasonably in the future. I really ask you to try.}
{5650}{}{你帮助了一个杀人犯，我相信他就是凶手，不管他说什么。你觉得呢？至少在这个过程中你没有伤害任何人。也许试图在城外生存对科尔来说是比处决更大的惩罚。但请你以后尽量表现得更合理些。我真的要你试试。}

#{5700}{}{He isn't the brightest of people, is he? I wish I could hear him trying to explain to his officers that he lost his armor and weapon. I'm positive he won't tell them the truth. Serves him right, I hope it will teach him a lesson.}

#{5702}{}{Hopefully, but he really wasn't very clever.}
{5702}{}{希望如此，但他真的不是很聪明。}
#{5750}{}{Father was completely devoted to the empire and his work. Maybe too much. Don't get me wrong, I loved him, but he was always so occupied I hardly ever had a chance to talk to him. And when we managed to synchronize our spare time, all he would talk about was still work. He put too much pressure on himself. And on me and Sindian as well. You know very well why I cannot take up his position yet. But when it happens, I'm not certain if I can match my father. Certainly not in the eyes of doctor Brooke.}
{5750}{}{父亲完全献身于帝国和他的工作。可能太多了。别误会，我爱他，但他总是忙得不可开交，我几乎没有机会和他说话。当我们设法使我们的业余时间同步时，他所说的仍然是工作。他给自己施加了太大的压力。还有我和辛迪安。你很清楚为什么我还不能担任他的职务。但当它发生的时候，我不确定我是否能和我父亲相提并论。当然不是在布鲁克医生眼里。}
#{5751}{}{Look on the bright side of it. When you take over the hospital, Brooke will be your subordinate. You can make him sweat like a brahmin on a hot day.}

#{5753}{}{Don't worry. I believe you'll prove to everybody how capable you are.}
{5753}{}{别担心。我相信你会向大家证明你有多能干。}
#{5800}{}{[Lystra smiles.] Funny, I never thought about it like that. But I think he would actually prefer it. He may complain as much as he can, but he is happiest when he has lots of work to do. Let's leave it, Brooke is a good doctor.}

#{5850}{}{His attitude really shocks me. Anonym is a serious threat that mustn't be taken lightly. I just fear that even if he tried as hard as he could, he would have troubles completing that task.

#{5900}{}{Everybody would like to know who the person is and where they're from. Believe it or not, the person really calls himself Anonym and that is all we know about him, or her. They are obviously trying to hide their true identity. And they're very good at it. Their aim is to overthrow the rule of Emperor Myzrael and his advisers, to erase our government. It is difficult to say why, and what they're after. However, they're not afraid to use violence in order to achieve it. Perhaps now you'll understand why they're such a serious threat and why the empire is willing to spend considerable expenses in order to apprehend them.}
{5900}{}{每个人都想知道这个人是谁，他们来自哪里。信不信由你，这个人真的自称匿名，这就是我们对他或她所知的一切。他们显然在试图隐藏自己的真实身份。他们很擅长。他们的目的是推翻米兹雷尔皇帝及其顾问的统治，消灭我们的政府。很难说原因和他们的目的。然而，他们并不害怕为了达到目的而使用暴力。也许现在你会明白为什么他们是如此严重的威胁，为什么帝国愿意花费大量的费用来逮捕他们。}

#{6400}{}{The Hunters are always on the search for the most advanced pre-war technologies that would provide them with an advantage when in battle.

{6602}{}{变异猎人会怎么样？他们会被允许离开吗？}
#{6603}{}{I have another question.}
{6603}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{6604}{}{I'm glad to hear that.}
{6604}{}{听到这个我很高兴。}
#{6650}{}{If we could simply banish them from Albuquerque, our army would most likely have done so a long time ago. Unfortunately, we still need them. They are the only thing standing between us and the Rebirth. We'll simply have to be more vigilant than before. However, we'll have to deal with them sooner or later. I believe it's inevitable. I'm positive Emperor Aran will properly prepare us for it.}
{6650}{}{如果我们能简单地把他们从阿尔伯克基驱逐出去，我们的军队很可能早就这样做了。不幸的是，我们仍然需要他们。他们是唯一的东西站在我们和重生之间。我们只需要比以前更加警惕。不过，我们迟早要对付他们。我相信这是不可避免的。我肯定阿兰皇帝会为我们做好准备的。}

#{6652}{}{I have another question.}
{6652}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{6653}{}{But it obviously won't happen anytime soon. There's no point discussing it now, let's go.}
{6653}{}{但这显然不会很快发生。现在没必要讨论了，我们走吧。}
#{6700}{}{We can try and discuss the option with them. Don't give me that look! Just because no one has tried before doesn't mean it's impossible. They can't all be stupid murderous monsters as the Hunters describe them. Maybe once they recognize you're not their enemy, they will be more prone to make a deal. Or do you find it more probable we can survive in a fight with a group of supermutants armed to the teeth?}
{6700}{}{我们可以试着和他们讨论这个选择。别那样看我！以前没人试过并不意味着不可能。他们不可能像猎人描述的那样都是愚蠢凶残的怪物。也许一旦他们意识到你不是他们的敌人，他们会更倾向于达成协议。或者你觉得我们更有可能在与一群武装到牙齿的超级变种人的战斗中幸存下来？}
#{6701}{}{I have another question.}
{6701}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{6702}{}{We'll see. But I wouldn't bet we'll get through this without a fight.}
{6702}{}{我们拭目以待。但我敢打赌我们一定能挺过来。}
#{6750}{}{I don't like it. I appreciate you were able to reach an agreement with a supermutant instead of simply attacking them, but the thing he asks of you... He seeks to kill humans.

The worst thing is I don't see a way out of this situation. By that I mean other than the one where we end up dead.}
{6750}{}{我不喜欢。我很感激你能和一个超级变形金刚达成协议，而不是简单地攻击他们，但是他对你的要求。。。他想杀人。我理解他的理由，但帮助他实现这一目标是不正确的。尽管塞巴斯蒂安犯了那么多罪，他是个多么令人讨厌的人。最糟糕的是我找不到摆脱这种局面的办法。我是说除了我们死的那个。}

#{6753}{}{I have another question.}
{6753}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{6754}{}{Yes, it's either this or fighting the supermutants.}
{6754}{}{是的，不是这个就是和超级变种人战斗。}
#{6800}{}{Dernus is right. Sebastian is the one who is keeping them united. He collected all those mercenaries, killers and raiders, trained them, keeps them disciplined and provides them with an obvious reason to live. Without him, those in command will most likely start competing for the dominant position among the Hunters. The worst case scenario would be an open conflict that'll endanger everyone in the vicinity.}
{6800}{}{德纳斯是对的。塞巴斯蒂安是保持他们团结的人。他收集了所有的雇佣兵，杀手和袭击者，训练他们，保持他们的纪律，并为他们提供了一个明显的理由生活。如果没有他，那些掌权者很可能会开始在猎人中争夺统治地位。最坏的情况是一场公开的冲突，会危及附近的每一个人。}
#{6801}{}{I have another question.}
{6801}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{6802}{}{Thanks for your estimate.}
{6802}{}{谢谢你的估计。}
#{6850}{}{The Rebirth... We have really found their base. Unbelievable. It doesn't look like much at a first glance. There must be more. There must be some kind of facility underground.}
{6850}{}{重生。。。我们真的找到了他们的基地。难以置信。乍一看不太像。一定还有更多。地下一定有什么设施。}

{6853}{}{嗯。}
#{6900}{}{Have you also concluded that ghoul was speaking the truth? You must have better insight than I do. Maybe it triggered a memory.

#{6950}{}{Of course I want to find out as much as possible about the Rebirth. But this is no simple curiosity. We have to stop the Rebirth.

{6950}{}{当然我想尽可能多的了解重生。但这不是简单的好奇心。我们必须停止重生。这样我们就能保护阿尔伯克基和周围地区的无数生命。这正是我哥哥一直在争取的。我现在不会后退，我们现在真的可以做到。}

#{7000}{}{It seems that there exist darker moments in the history of the empire, in particular of our Vault. It was not easy for me to listen to it, you can trust me. There was no justice in the way they treated her then. They gave in too much to their own fear. Please don't misunderstand me, they couldn't have just let her into the Vault. That would have endangered everybody. Nevertheless, they should have found a way to help her. Make her life on the surface easier, not just drive her away with threats. I wish I could do something to mend it, but I'm afraid Jess no longer cares about it. She was driven to hate all people.}
{7000}{}{在帝国的历史上，特别是在我们的金库中，似乎存在着更黑暗的时刻。我不容易听，你可以相信我。当时他们对待她的方式是不公平的。他们太屈服于自己的恐惧了。请不要误解我的意思，他们不可能让她进金库的。那会危及每个人。尽管如此，他们还是应该想办法帮助她。让她表面上的生活更轻松，而不是用威胁把她赶走。我希望我能做点什么来修补它，但我恐怕杰斯不再关心它了。她被驱使去恨所有的人。}

{7053}{}{谢谢你的建议，我会考虑的。}
#{7100}{}{The one who is leading the ghouls in their fight against the Hunters, their greatest enemy, is one of them! The Hunters practically fight themselves, their own ideology.

The empire will have to stop them. Otherwise they will give birth to some new menace.}
{7100}{}{带领僵尸与他们最大的敌人猎人战斗的人就是他们中的一员！猎人们实际上是在和他们自己的意识形态作斗争。这是如此荒谬，我会笑，如果这种情况还没有付出这么多的生命。也许我们甚至已经设法带来了猎人的开始和结束。帝国必须阻止他们。否则就会产生新的威胁。}

#{7150}{}{Of course. However, I cannot help you without basic medical equipment. I need at least a first aid kit; a doctor's bag would be even better if you want me to fix fractures or other serious injuries. Such equipment won't be easy to come by. Or cheap, for that matter. If you believe it isn't something serious, I recommend using a stimpak instead.}
{7150}{}{当然。但是，没有基本的医疗设备我帮不了你。我至少需要一个急救箱；如果你想让我治骨折或其他重伤，医生的包会更好。这样的设备不容易得到。或者便宜。如果你认为这不是什么严重的问题，我建议用stimpak来代替。}
