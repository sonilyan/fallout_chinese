#{150}{}{You see Margaret Dandridge.}
{150}{}{你看到玛格丽特・丹德里奇了。}
#{200}{}{You see an attractive middle-aged dweller.}
{200}{}{你看到一个迷人的中年居民。}
#{250}{}{You see Margaret Dandridge, the supply officer.}
{250}{}{你看供应官玛格丽特・丹德里奇。}
#{300}{}{That's our storeroom. You're not allowed there, obviously.}
{300}{}{那是我们的储藏室。很明显，你不允许去那里。}
#{301}{}{Are you serious? Guards!}
{301}{}{你是认真的吗？警卫！}
#{500}{}{Hello, I'm Margaret Dandridge, the supply officer. You can call me just Margaret. I know you foreigners aren't much for formality. Have you come to trade?}
{500}{}{你好，我是供应官玛格丽特・丹德里奇。你可以叫我玛格丽特。我知道你们外国人不太讲究礼节。你是来交易的吗？}
#{501}{}{Hello, I'm Margaret Dandridge, the supply officer. You can call me just Margaret. I know you foreigners aren't much for formality. Have you come to trade?}
{501}{}{你好，我是供应官玛格丽特・丹德里奇。你可以叫我玛格丽特。我知道你们外国人不太讲究礼节。你是来交易的吗？}
#{502}{}{Hello Margaret, maybe I have. What does a supply officer do?}
{502}{}{你好，玛格丽特，也许我有。补给官是干什么的？}
#{503}{}{Hello Margaret, maybe I have. What does a supply officer do?}
{503}{}{你好，玛格丽特，也许我有。补给官是干什么的？}
#{504}{}{I think I like Marge more. Hello, I'm }
{504}{}{我想我更喜欢玛姬。你好，我是}
#{505}{}{[Wave with both your hands.] Heeeey Maageret!}
{505}{}{[双手挥手]嘿，玛格瑞特！}
#{550}{}{[She laughs.] You're the funniest foreigner I've seen so far. But seriously, enough of that, I need get back to work. What is it you need?}
{550}{}{你是我见过的最有趣的外国人。但说真的，够了，我得回去工作了。你需要什么？}
#{551}{}{[She laughs.] You're the funniest foreigner I've seen so far. But seriously, enough of that, I need get back to work. What is it you need?}
{551}{}{你是我见过的最有趣的外国人。但说真的，够了，我得回去工作了。你需要什么？}
#{552}{}{Maar-ga-ret, haa!}
{552}{}{玛尔加雷特，哈亚！}
#{600}{}{OK, I see you're not quite alright. You know what? I'll just keep working and you... Hmm? Just do what you usually do and let's not talk to each other anymore. I think that'll be for the best.}
{600}{}{好吧，我看你不是很好。你知道吗？我会继续工作而你。。。隐马尔可夫模型？做你平时做的事，我们不要再互相交谈了。我想这样最好。}
#{601}{}{Bai Margaa.}
{601}{}{白玛迦。}
#{650}{}{Ah, of course, you're here for the first time. I'm in charge of distributing supplies to the dwellers. Basically, I make sure every dweller has what he needs. But I'm also authorized to trade with foreigners. To that end, I'm authorized to make use of the most common currency - caps. That's why I asked if you're here to trade.}
{650}{}{啊，当然，你是第一次来这里。我负责向居民分发物资。基本上，我确保每个居民都有他需要的。但我也有权和外国人做生意。为此，我有权使用最常见的货币上限。所以我问你是不是来交易的。}
#{651}{}{What goods do you trade with?}
{651}{}{你们用什么商品交易？}
#{652}{}{The dwellers just get everything they ask for?}
{652}{}{居住者得到了他们想要的一切？}
#{653}{}{I'm supposed to collect the pay for some work I've done here.}
{653}{}{我应该为我在这里做的一些工作收钱。}
#{654}{}{I'm not interested in trading. Goodbye.}
{654}{}{我对交易不感兴趣。再见。}
#{700}{}{We sell various technical equipment, energy cells, and medicine. We only rarely sell weapons, some decommissioned energy pistols at best. I mention that because that's the first thing most foreigners ask. On the other hand, we mainly buy brahmin meat and cereals; basically fresh, quality food with minimum radiation. We also require a large amount of mineral resources, but that doesn't really have anything to do with you. On a small scale, I'm willing to buy anything that has some value.}
{700}{}{我们销售各种技术设备、能源电池和药品。我们很少出售武器，充其量是一些退役的能量手枪。我提到这一点是因为这是大多数外国人问的第一件事。另一方面，我们主要购买双头牛肉和谷类食品；基本上是新鲜的、质量好的、辐射量最小的食品。我们也需要大量的矿产资源，但这与你无关。在小范围内，我愿意买任何有价值的东西。}
#{701}{}{Alright, let's trade.}
{701}{}{好吧，我们交易吧。}
#{702}{}{And how about, say, a pulse pistol?}
{702}{}{比如说，脉冲手枪怎么样？}
#{703}{}{Did you say that the dwellers just get everything they ask for?}
{703}{}{你是说那些居民得到了他们想要的一切吗？}
#{704}{}{I'm supposed to collect the pay for some work I've done here.}
{704}{}{我应该为我在这里做的一些工作收钱。}
#{705}{}{I'm not interested in trading. Goodbye.}
{705}{}{我对交易不感兴趣。再见。}
#{750}{}{Do you need anything else from me?}
{750}{}{你还需要我给你什么吗？}
#{751}{}{Actually, we can still trade a bit.}
{751}{}{实际上，我们还可以交易一点。}
#{752}{}{Would you happen to have a pulse pistol stashed somewhere?}
{752}{}{你会不会碰巧在什么地方藏了一把脉冲手枪？}
#{753}{}{Did you say that the dwellers just get everything they ask for?}
{753}{}{你是说那些居民得到了他们想要的一切吗？}
#{754}{}{I'm supposed to collect the pay for some work I've done here.}
{754}{}{我应该为我在这里做的一些工作收钱。}
#{755}{}{That will be all, thanks.}
{755}{}{就这些了，谢谢。}
#{800}{}{Pulse? Hmm... I've heard about that... Yes, of course. The army has a few of them, and they guard them well. I don't offer those here, obviously, what made you think so? They'll never be for sale.}
{800}{}{脉搏？隐马尔可夫模型。。。我听说了。。。是的，当然。军队有几个人，他们守卫得很好。我这里不提供这些，很明显，是什么让你这么想的？它们永远不会出售。}
#{801}{}{No matter, we can still trade.}
{801}{}{不管怎样，我们还是可以交易的。}
#{802}{}{Did you say that the dwellers just get everything they ask for?}
{802}{}{你是说那些居民得到了他们想要的一切吗？}
#{803}{}{Well, let me at least pick up the pay for the work I've done then.}
{803}{}{好吧，至少让我拿我那时候做的工作的工资吧。}
#{804}{}{Ah well, thanks for the effort.}
{804}{}{啊，谢谢你的努力。}
#{850}{}{I know you foreigners have trouble believing or understanding that. The dwellers get everything they need to live and do their job. That's a bit different than "getting everything they ask for". But usually no one complains, we don't really lack anything. We have no currency, the dwellers have no need of caps. My office is the only store in the whole City, set up precisely for foreigners.}
{850}{}{我知道你们外国人很难相信或理解这一点。居民们得到了生活和工作所需的一切。这和“得到他们想要的一切”有点不同。但通常没人抱怨，我们其实什么都不缺。我们没有货币，居民不需要上限。我的办公室是全市唯一一家专门为外国人开设的商店。}
#{851}{}{If the caps have no value here, could you give some to me? A few thousands perhaps?}
{851}{}{如果这些瓶盖在这里没有价值，你能给我一些吗？也许几千？}
#{852}{}{What goods do you trade with?}
{852}{}{你们用什么商品交易？}
#{853}{}{Alright, let's trade.}
{853}{}{好吧，我们交易吧。}
#{854}{}{Would you happen to have a pulse pistol stashed somewhere?}
{854}{}{你会不会碰巧在什么地方藏了一把脉冲手枪？}
#{855}{}{I'm supposed to collect the pay for some work I've done here.}
{855}{}{我应该为我在这里做的一些工作收钱。}
#{856}{}{Thanks for the explanation. I'll be going now.}
{856}{}{谢谢你的解释。我要走了。}
#{900}{}{[She smiles.] You're not the first one to ask, you know. They really have no value to us, but outside the City, they are currency, and a cheap means of trade with the outside world for us. Furthermore, we make sure to never issue too many caps. Inflation wouldn't help anyone. It's complicated, but in short, no, I don't just hand out caps.}
{900}{}{你知道，你不是第一个问的人。它们对我们来说真的没有价值，但在城市之外，它们是货币，是我们与外部世界进行廉价贸易的手段。此外，我们确保永远不会发行太多的上限。通货膨胀对任何人都没有帮助。这很复杂，但简而言之，不，我不只是分发瓶盖。}
#{901}{}{What goods do you trade with?}
{901}{}{你们用什么商品交易？}
#{902}{}{Alright, let's trade.}
{902}{}{好吧，我们交易吧。}
#{903}{}{Would you happen to have a pulse pistol stashed somewhere?}
{903}{}{你会不会碰巧在什么地方藏了一把脉冲手枪？}
#{904}{}{I'm supposed to collect the pay for some work I've done here.}
{904}{}{我应该为我在这里做的一些工作收钱。}
#{905}{}{Worth a try. I'll be on my way.}
{905}{}{值得一试。我马上就来。}
#{950}{}{Yes, I've received the message. I almost didn't believe it. It's not usual to hire foreigners here, especially for someone so high up. Of course, it's none of my business, nobody would tell me what it was about, I'm just supposed to give you your caps.}
{950}{}{是的，我收到消息了。我几乎不相信。在这里雇外国人是不常见的，尤其是对这么高的人。当然，这不关我的事，没人会告诉我是怎么回事，我只是想把瓶盖给你。}
#{951}{}{Nobody has hired any foreigners except me lately? No one was here to collect caps?}
{951}{}{最近除了我没人雇外国人？没人来收瓶盖？}
#{952}{}{What do you have for me then?}
{952}{}{那你有什么要给我的？}
#{1000}{}{Only Lystra has collected a small sum recently, but I really shouldn't talk about that. It's her personal business. I didn't say anything, OK? Besides that, no one. Of course, advisers, for example, can take as many caps as they want without anything going into the records, but why would they do that? All the payments officially pass through my office.}
{1000}{}{最近只有莱斯特拉收了一小笔钱，但我真的不该谈这个。这是她的私事。我什么都没说，好吗？除此之外，没有人。当然，以顾问为例，他们可以在没有任何记录的情况下，任意多取上限，但他们为什么要这样做呢？所有的付款正式通过我的办公室。}
#{1001}{}{What do you have for me then?}
{1001}{}{那你有什么要给我的？}
#{1050}{}{You're right, there's one more payment registered. }
{1050}{}{你说得对，还有一笔付款。}
#{1051}{}{Adviser Aran authorized me to pay you }
{1051}{}{阿兰顾问授权我付钱给你}
#{1052}{}{Adviser Elisa authorized me to pay you }
{1052}{}{伊莉莎顾问授权我付钱给你}
#{1053}{}{Emperor Aran authorized me to pay you }
{1053}{}{阿兰皇帝授权我付钱给你}
#{1054}{}{Empress Elisa authorized me to pay you }
{1054}{}{伊莉莎皇后授权我付钱给你}
#{1055}{}{Colonel Parson authorized me to pay you }
{1055}{}{帕森上校授权我付钱给你}
#{1056}{}{ caps. I have them all ready, here they are. [She gives you them sum.]}
{1056}{}{瓶盖。我都准备好了，给你。[她给了你一笔钱。]}
#{1057}{}{For your help with catching a murderer, private Sneed's superior authorized me to pay you }
{1057}{}{为了帮你抓到一个杀人犯，斯内德的上级授权我付钱给你}
#{1058}{}{Is that everything?}
{1058}{}{就这些吗？}
#{1100}{}{[She checks the records one more time.] Yes, everything. The payments are recorded quite meticulously. Don't worry about missing out.}
{1100}{}{[她再检查一次记录]是的，所有的。付款记录得相当仔细。别担心错过。}
#{1101}{}{[She checks the records one more time.] Yes, everything. The payments are recorded quite meticulously. Don't worry about missing out.}
{1101}{}{[她再检查一次记录]是的，所有的。付款记录得相当仔细。别担心错过。}
#{1102}{}{I was interested in what you trade with.}
{1102}{}{我对你的交易很感兴趣。}
#{1103}{}{We can trade now that I have caps.}
{1103}{}{既然我有上限，我们就可以交易了。}
#{1104}{}{Would you happen to have a pulse pistol stashed somewhere?}
{1104}{}{你会不会碰巧在什么地方藏了一把脉冲手枪？}
#{1105}{}{Did you say that the dwellers just get everything they ask for?}
{1105}{}{你是说那些居民得到了他们想要的一切吗？}
#{1106}{}{Thanks, I'll be going now.}
{1106}{}{谢谢，我现在就走。}
#{1150}{}{Hello, welcome back. Have you come to trade, or do you need something else?}
{1150}{}{你好，欢迎回来。你是来交易的，还是需要别的东西？}
#{1151}{}{Hello, welcome back. Have you come to trade, or do you need something else?}
{1151}{}{你好，欢迎回来。你是来交易的，还是需要别的东西？}
#{1152}{}{ I'm not sure I told you, I have to warn almost every foreigner about this, but it's not customary to walk around with a weapon drawn. It's not necessary at all. You'll see that the dwellers will react better then.}
{1152}{}{我不确定我是否告诉过你，我必须警告几乎所有的外国人这一点，但这是不习惯走在周围的武器拔。完全没有必要。你会看到居住者的反应会更好。}
#{1153}{}{What goods do you trade with?}
{1153}{}{你们用什么商品交易？}
#{1154}{}{Very well, let's trade.}
{1154}{}{很好，我们交易吧。}
#{1155}{}{Would you happen to have a pulse pistol stashed somewhere?}

#{1158}{}{I don't need anything. Goodbye.}
{1158}{}{我什么都不需要。再见。}
#{1159}{}{Uff.}
{1159}{}{不明飞行物。}
#{1160}{}{Hello Marge. I just wanted to see you. I don't really feel comfortable in the empire. You're the only one I'm happy to chat with.}
{1160}{}{你好，玛吉。我只是想见你。我在帝国里感觉不太舒服。你是我唯一乐意和你聊天的人。}
#{1161}{}{[Lean towards her and whisper.] I need you, Marge. I keep thinking about you.}
{1161}{}{我需要你，玛姬。我一直在想你。}
#{1200}{}{Ehh... It's you. Let's just continue not talking to each other, OK? I think we should.}
{1200}{}{呃。。。是你。我们还是别再说话了，好吗？我想我们应该。}
#{1201}{}{I'm sorry Margaret, that's what your name was, right? I was in a bad shape, but I feel better now.}
{1201}{}{对不起，玛格丽特，那就是你的名字，对吗？我身体不好，但现在感觉好多了。}
#{1202}{}{I'm sorry Margaret, that's what your name was, right? I was in a bad shape, but I feel better now.}
{1202}{}{对不起，玛格丽特，那就是你的名字，对吗？我身体不好，但现在感觉好多了。}
#{1203}{}{Og.}
{1203}{}{奥格。}
#{1250}{}{Alright, fine. You foreigners are really strange sometimes. What do you need from a supply officer then?}
{1250}{}{好吧，很好。你们外国人有时候真的很奇怪。那你需要补给官做什么？}
#{1251}{}{What does a supply officer do?}
{1251}{}{补给官是干什么的？}
#{1300}{}{Ehh... That's nice, but let's stay with Margaret, OK? What do you need }
{1300}{}{呃。。。很好，但我们还是和玛格丽特在一起，好吗？你需要什么}
#{1301}{}{?}
{1301}{}{?}
#{1302}{}{What does a supply officer do?}
{1302}{}{补给官是干什么的？}
#{1350}{}{[She smiles.] Alright, it's Marge for you. Pleased to meet you }
{1350}{}{[她笑了]好的，我是玛吉。很高兴见到你}
#{1351}{}{. What can I do for you?}
{1351}{}{. 有什么事吗？}
#{1352}{}{We'll see about that, Marge. First tell me what does a supply officer do.}
{1352}{}{我们拭目以待，玛吉。先告诉我补给官是干什么的。}
#{1400}{}{[She tries to suppress her smile.] You're nice, but let's stop that. Let's just go back to business. Do you need something?}
{1400}{}{[她试着忍住微笑]你很好，但我们别这样。我们还是继续谈正事吧。你需要什么吗？}
#{1401}{}{Tell me what you trade with then.}
{1401}{}{告诉我你用什么交易。}
#{1402}{}{Can we trade?}

{1405}{}{我应该为我在这里做的一些工作收钱。}
#{1406}{}{That will be all, Marge. But I'll be back.}
{1406}{}{就这些，玛吉。但我会回来的。}
#{1450}{}{[She leans towards you.] My, you're persistent. I've met quite a few interesting foreigners, but you take the cake. I like you too, but me and a sav... Erm, I mean, foreigner...}
{1450}{}{[她向你倾斜]天哪，你太固执了。我遇到过不少有趣的外国人，但你来拿蛋糕吧。我也喜欢你，但我和一个医生。。。呃，我是说，外国人。。。}
#{1451}{}{You wanted to say savage, didn't you? Want to have a taste of savage sex? I want you, Marge.}
{1451}{}{你想说萨维奇，是吗？想尝尝野蛮的性爱吗？我要你，玛吉。}
#{1500}{}{[She bites her lower lip and hesitates for but a moment.] OK, we can go to the storeroom. [She straightens up and raises her voice so that the guard standing nearby could hear her.] All the requested goods have been prepared, as we agreed. You can come see for yourself if you wish. But not alone, I'll have to accompany you.}
{1500}{}{[她咬着下唇，犹豫了一会儿]好的，我们可以去储藏室。[她站直了身子，提高了嗓门，以便站在旁边的卫兵能听到她的声音。]所有要求的货物都按照我们的约定准备好了。如果你愿意，你可以自己来看看。但不是一个人，我要陪你。}
#{1501}{}{[Play with her.] Alright, no problem. I want to check the goods personally, no matter how long it takes. Let's go.}
{1501}{}{[和她玩]好的，没问题。我想亲自检查货物，不管要多长时间。走吧。}
#{1550}{}{[She looks quite satisfied while she straightens her jumpsuit.] You weren't lying, it really was wild. Different than with a dweller. I liked it, but once is enough. It's not against any rules, but my superiors probably wouldn't be happy to see me being in touch with foreigner this way. [She laughs at what she just said.] In my office, we'll act like nothing happened.}
{1550}{}{[她在整理连身衣时看起来很满意。]你没有撒谎，真的很疯狂。与居住者不同。我喜欢，但一次就够了。这并不违反任何规定，但我的上司可能不会高兴地看到我这样和外国人接触。[她笑了笑]在我的办公室，我们会装作什么都没发生过。}
#{1551}{}{I liked it too. As you wish.}
{1551}{}{我也喜欢。如你所愿。}
#{1552}{}{[She looks quite satisfied while she straightens her jumpsuit.] You weren't lying, it really was wild. I hope we didn't break anything when the stuff starting falling off shelves. I'll clean up the place later, I need to catch my breath first. I really liked it, but once is enough. It's not against any rules, but my superiors probably wouldn't be happy to see me being in touch with foreigner this way. [She laughs at what she just said.] In my office, we'll act like nothing happened.}
{1552}{}{[她在整理连身衣时看起来很满意。]你没有撒谎，真的很疯狂。我希望我们没有在货物开始下架时损坏任何东西。我待会再打扫，我得先喘口气。我真的很喜欢，但一次就够了。这并不违反任何规定，但我的上司可能不会高兴地看到我这样和外国人接触。[她笑了笑]在我的办公室，我们会装作什么都没发生过。}
#{1600}{}{Alright. Fix your clothes and then leave the storeroom. And please, try to hurry so you don't raise any suspicions. [She lightly slaps you on your butt before leaving.]}
{1600}{}{好吧。把衣服修好，然后离开储藏室。请你快点，这样你就不会引起任何怀疑了。[离开前她轻轻地拍了拍你的屁股。]}
#{1601}{}{Bye, Marge.}
{1601}{}{再见，玛吉。}
#{1650}{}{It was a pleasure doing business with you. [She smiles.]}
{1650}{}{很高兴和你做生意。[她笑了。]}
#{1651}{}{Thanks.}
{1651}{}{谢谢。}
