{100}{}{你看。。。哇，她真是个混蛋！}
#{101}{}{You see a beautiful female soldier with a beautiful sub-machine gun in her hands.}
{101}{}{你看到一个漂亮的女兵手里拿着一把漂亮的冲锋枪。}
#{102}{}{You see a woman who looks like a mixture of a tough soldier and a math teacher.}
{102}{}{你看到一个女人，她看起来像一个坚强的士兵和一个数学老师的混合体。}
#{103}{}{You see a woman who radiates scientific aura.}
{103}{}{你看到一个散发着科学气息的女人。}
#{150}{}{You see Sam Carter. She looks like she is thinking about something.}
{150}{}{你看到山姆・卡特了。她看起来好像在想什么。}
#{151}{}{You see Major Doctor Samantha Carter.}
{151}{}{你去看萨曼莎・卡特少校。}
#{200}{}{There is a strange symbol on her uniform and she is armed with a sub-machine gun and is carrying a lot of devices.}
{200}{}{她的制服上有一个奇怪的符号，她手持一把冲锋枪，携带着很多装置。}
#{250}{}{Even if she doesn't look like it, this blonde is both a damn good fighter and a scientist!}
{250}{}{即使她看起来不像这样，这个金发碧眼的女人既是一个他妈的好战士，也是一个科学家！}
#{300}{}{The radiation gradient of positively charged positrons is rising!}
{300}{}{带正电子的辐射梯度在上升！}
#{301}{}{I am getting the signs of trinium and naquadah from the direction of 325 to 5.}
{301}{}{我正在从325到5的方向上看到特里尼和纳夸达的迹象。}
#{302}{}{It seems like the gate is radiating chronometrical isopolar quantum-photonic chronitronictetrionical particles.}
{302}{}{门似乎是在辐射计时等极性量子光子计时电子粒子。}
#{500}{}{Hello, do you need something?}
{500}{}{你好，你需要什么吗？}
#{501}{}{Do you beep beep?}
{501}{}{你哔哔哔吗？}
#{502}{}{What are you doing here with all those devices?}

#{503}{}{How is the measuring going?}
{503}{}{测量进展如何？}
#{504}{}{I want to ask...}
{504}{}{我想问。。。}
#{550}{}{Sorry, but I don't understand you.}

{552}{}{31428571}
#{600}{}{I am doing the measuring of multispectral radiation.}
{600}{}{我正在测量多光谱辐射。}
#{601}{}{Ehm. That is very... Interesting, but I would rather ask...}
{601}{}{嗯。那是非常。。。有意思，但我想问。。。}
#{602}{}{Ehm. That is very... Interesting, but I would rather ask...}
{602}{}{嗯。那是非常。。。有意思，但我想问。。。}
#{603}{}{Damn it, I hope it's not contagious. I'd rather leave!}
{603}{}{妈的，我希望不会传染。我宁愿离开！}
#{604}{}{What did you say you do? No, you DON'T HAVE TO answer!}
{604}{}{你说你做了什么？不，你不必回答！}
#{605}{}{Really? I bet that you would find really high levels on me, girl.}
{605}{}{真正地？我敢打赌你会发现我的情绪很高，女孩。}
#{650}{}{I am finding elevated levels of background radiation. It looks like a rudimentary exhalation of nuclear explosions.}
{650}{}{我发现背景辐射水平升高。它看起来像是核爆炸的初步喷发。}
#{651}{}{What?}
{651}{}{什么？}
#{652}{}{That's interesting. What else?}
{652}{}{那很有趣。还有什么？}
#{653}{}{Could it be a case of an excitation of hard cores from the grid of unstable elements in mineral rocks?}
{653}{}{这可能是矿物岩石中不稳定元素网格激发的硬核吗？}
#{654}{}{I better bounce, before it's too late!}
{654}{}{我最好振作起来，不然就太晚了！}
#{700}{}{Yes?}
{700}{}{对？}
#{701}{}{Who are you?}
{701}{}{你是谁？}
#{702}{}{Tell me about the team.}

#{706}{}{No, nothing.}
{706}{}{不，没什么。}

#{852}{}{Good, now I want to ask you...}
{852}{}{很好，现在我想问你。。。}
#{853}{}{Have fun.}
{853}{}{玩得高兴。}
#{900}{}{Ehm, no doubt about that.}
{900}{}{嗯，毫无疑问。}
#{901}{}{What if we do some measuring? Just the two of us. Maybe we could even do an experiment. What do you say? [Move your eyebrows ostentatiously.]}
{901}{}{如果我们做些测量呢？只有我们两个。也许我们可以做个实验。你怎么说？[扬眉吐气]}
#{902}{}{Of course, I'm the biggest dime on earth!}
{902}{}{当然，我是地球上最大的一角！}
#{950}{}{Simply put, an atomic bomb exploded here.}
{950}{}{简单地说，这里发生了原子弹爆炸。}
#{951}{}{Well, that explains a lot! Can I ask you about...}
{951}{}{好吧，这解释了很多！我能问你关于。。。}
#{952}{}{Thanks, that's enough for me.}
{952}{}{谢谢，我受够了。}
#{1000}{}{The quantity of subatomic particles is unusually high. It could be caused only by a catastrophe on a global scale.}
{1000}{}{亚原子粒子的数量异常多。它只能由全球范围的灾难造成。}
#{1001}{}{Look, let's talk about something I understand.}
{1001}{}{听着，让我们谈谈我能理解的事情。}
#{1002}{}{Something like... Nuclear war?}
{1002}{}{有点像。。。核战争？}
#{1050}{}{What kind of radiation do you have in mind?}
{1050}{}{你想要什么样的辐射？}
#{1051}{}{Radiation from a solar prominence.}
{1051}{}{日珥的辐射。}
#{1052}{}{Maybe some kind of artificial source, some weapon.}
{1052}{}{可能是某种人工来源，某种武器。}
#{1053}{}{Well... Maybe some industrial accident.}
{1053}{}{好。。。可能是工业事故。}
#{1100}{}{Major Samantha Carter, United States Air Force.}
{1100}{}{萨曼莎・卡特少校，美国空军。}
#{1101}{}{Are you a soldier or a scientist?}
{1101}{}{你是军人还是科学家？}
#{1102}{}{Tell me...}
{1102}{}{告诉我。。。}
#{1150}{}{The SG-1 team is the flagship team of the SGC program. The officer in charge is Colonel Jack O17Neill.}
{1150}{}{SG-1团队是SGC项目的旗舰团队。主管军官是杰克・奥尼尔上校。}
#{1151}{}{OK, now, tell me about...}
{1151}{}{好吧，现在，告诉我。。。}
#{1152}{}{And who are these other two dudes?}
{1152}{}{另外两个家伙是谁？}
#{1200}{}{The stargate is a giant superconductor made out of an alien mineral called naquadah. Space is penetrated by the unstable vortex, rectified by the gate, and extra dimensionally connected to another gate. Matter located in the gate's scope disintegrates; then it's transferred as energy through a wormhole and reintegrated on the other side.}
{1200}{}{星门是一个巨大的超导体，由一种叫做纳夸达的外星矿物制成。空间被不稳定的漩涡穿透，由闸门矫正，并额外连接到另一个闸门。位于闸门范围内的物质分解，然后作为能量通过虫洞转移，并在另一侧重新整合。}
#{1201}{}{I've got a question about that.}
{1201}{}{我有个问题。}
#{1202}{}{Cool. Now I want to hear something about...}
{1202}{}{很酷。现在我想听听关于。。。}
#{1203}{}{This gate appears to be damaged.}
{1203}{}{这扇门好像坏了。}
#{1250}{}{Yes?}
{1250}{}{对？}
#{1251}{}{You really understand all the stuff you are talking about?}
{1251}{}{你真的明白你所说的一切吗？}
#{1252}{}{What kind of energy are we talking about?}
{1252}{}{我们说的是什么样的能量？}
#{1253}{}{A superconductor in normal temperature? That's incredible.}
{1253}{}{常温下的超导体？太不可思议了。}
#{1254}{}{So the stargate connects two different points in time?}
{1254}{}{所以星际之门连接了两个不同的时间点？}
#{1255}{}{How does it feel?}
{1255}{}{感觉如何？}
#{1256}{}{Thanks, that's enough for me.}
{1256}{}{谢谢，我受够了。}
#{1300}{}{We took of on a standard mission to P3Q119, but it seems like a solar prominence of the local sun threw us back here, but far ahead on the time line.}
{1300}{}{我们带着一个标准的任务去了P3Q119，但似乎是当地太阳的日珥把我们抛回了这里，但在时间线上遥遥领先。}
#{1301}{}{Eh. Got it. Now, tell me about...}
{1301}{}{嗯。知道了。现在，告诉我。。。}
#{1302}{}{And how will you get back?}
{1302}{}{你怎么回来？}
#{1303}{}{Could the time shift be of some use?}
{1303}{}{时差有什么用吗？}
#{1350}{}{Ten forty eight. Give or take 300 years. Some other question?}
{1350}{}{十点四十八分。要么300年。还有别的问题吗？}
#{1351}{}{Thanks. I want to know about...}
{1351}{}{谢谢。我想知道。。。}
#{1352}{}{No.}
{1352}{}{不。}
#{1400}{}{You rude boy!}
{1400}{}{你这个粗鲁的孩子！}
#{1401}{}{You rude girl.}
{1401}{}{你这个粗鲁的女孩。}
#{1402}{}{Gah.}
{1402}{}{嘎。}
#{1450}{}{So, you should go see Daniel Jackson - he's that hippie with glasses.}
{1450}{}{所以，你应该去看看丹尼尔・杰克逊――他就是那个戴眼镜的嬉皮士。}
#{1451}{}{So, you should go see Daniel Jackson - he's that hippie with glasses.}

#{1452}{}{'kay.}
{1452}{}{“凯。}
#{1500}{}{And?}
{1500}{}{然后呢？}
#{1501}{}{Vroom... [Seizure ends.]}
{1501}{}{房间。。。[扣押结束。]}
#{1502}{}{34 55 89...}
{1502}{}{34 55 89...}
#{1550}{}{You poor bastard. Life was a little hard on you.}
{1550}{}{你这个可怜的混蛋。生活对你来说有点艰难。}
#{1551}{}{Pff.}
{1551}{}{Pff公司。}
#{1600}{}{You are as slimy as a Goa17uld. But to me, a Goa17uld is more likeable than you.}
{1600}{}{你像果阿乌尔一样黏糊糊的。但对我来说，果阿人比你更讨人喜欢。}
#{1601}{}{So I wish you and said goa-whatever gentleman a happy relationship. Goodbye.}
{1601}{}{所以我祝你和果阿先生的关系愉快。再见。}
#{1650}{}{Of course, Mr. Cool Guy, now get lost!}
{1650}{}{当然，帅哥先生，快滚！}
#{1651}{}{A moment! I wanted to ask about...}
{1651}{}{等一下！我想问问。。。}
#{1652}{}{Sure, I understand.}
{1652}{}{当然，我明白。}
#{1700}{}{Yes, that is very likely. A lot of very powerful charges must have been used. Oh God, is this what we were fighting for?}
{1700}{}{是的，很有可能。一定用了很多很厉害的炸药。天哪，这就是我们战斗的目的吗？}
#{1701}{}{Learning from the past is a good cornerstone for building the future.}
{1701}{}{向过去学习是建设未来的良好基石。}
#{1702}{}{Hm, tough luck. You didn't fight enough.}
{1702}{}{嗯，真倒霉。你打得不够。}
#{1750}{}{If that were the case, there wouldn't be so many holes around here.}
{1750}{}{如果是这样的话，这里就不会有这么多洞了。}
#{1751}{}{Oh, yes. Of course. So that must be something else.}
{1751}{}{哦，是的。当然。所以那一定是另外一回事。}
#{1752}{}{Sure. So... What about nuclear war?}
{1752}{}{当然。所以。。。那核战争呢？}
#{1800}{}{Only very strong nuclear charges are capable of doing something like that.}
{1800}{}{只有非常强大的核电荷才能做这样的事情。}
#{1801}{}{So, a nuclear war?}
{1801}{}{那么，核战争？}
#{1802}{}{Common nuclear bombs? It doesn't seem like it to me.}
{1802}{}{普通核弹？我觉得不是这样。}
#{1850}{}{Yeah, perhaps a Harley - Davidson fans reunion gone wrong. Besides, I'm not aware of any "civilian" way to turn Earth into this kind of state.}
{1850}{}{是啊，也许哈雷-戴维森的粉丝聚会出了问题。另外，我不知道有什么“平民”的方式可以把地球变成这种状态。}
#{1851}{}{Well, of course! It must have been bikers!}
{1851}{}{好吧，当然！一定是骑自行车的！}
#{1852}{}{So, that leaves us with nuclear bombing?}
{1852}{}{那么，那就剩下核弹了？}
#{1900}{}{A soldier and a scientist at the same time. I have a doctorate in astrophysics and a Medal of Honor. Anything else?}
{1900}{}{同时是一个士兵和一个科学家。我有天体物理学博士学位和荣誉勋章。还有别的吗？}
#{1901}{}{Actually, I wanted to ask about...}
{1901}{}{实际上，我想问问。。。}
#{1902}{}{Well, not really. Suddenly, I feel awfully inferior. Bye.}
{1902}{}{嗯，不太可能。突然间，我感到非常自卑。再见。}
#{1950}{}{Doctor Daniel Jackson is the archaeologist who deciphered the symbols on the gate. Teal17c is a Jaffa who fights with us against Goa17ulds.}
{1950}{}{丹尼尔・杰克逊博士是破译大门上符号的考古学家。蒂尔克是一个和我们一起对抗果阿乌尔的贾法。}
#{1951}{}{Who are the Jaffas?}
{1951}{}{贾法斯一家是谁？}
#{1952}{}{Who are the Goa17ulds?}
{1952}{}{果阿人是谁？}
#{1953}{}{Fine, now tell me...}
{1953}{}{好吧，现在告诉我。。。}
#{2000}{}{Yes, it looks like it was hit by some powerful explosion. Luckily, its inner structure stayed intact.}
{2000}{}{是的，看起来像是被强烈的爆炸击中了。幸运的是，它的内部结构完好无损。}
#{2001}{}{So can you travel back?}
{2001}{}{你能回去吗？}
#{2002}{}{And the time shift was caused by the damage?}
{2002}{}{时间转移是由损害造成的？}
#{2050}{}{I'm an astrophysicist and besides, I've work with stargate long enough. And even if anybody would ever be telling you anything, things I say always make sense.}
{2050}{}{我是一个天体物理学家，而且，我和星际之门合作的时间够长了。即使有人会告诉你任何事情，我说的话总是有意义的。}
#{2051}{}{I've got a question about the stargate.}
{2051}{}{我有个关于星际之门的问题。}
#{2052}{}{I've got another question...}
{2052}{}{我还有一个问题。。。}
#{2100}{}{Principally electrical, but converters in the gate allow one to use almost anything upon entry.}
{2100}{}{主要是电的，但是大门里的转换器允许人们在进入时使用几乎任何东西。}
#{2101}{}{I've got a question about the stargate.}
{2101}{}{我有个关于星际之门的问题。}
#{2102}{}{I've got another question...}
{2102}{}{我还有一个问题。。。}
#{2150}{}{I couldn't believe it either, at first. Apparently it's a whole new kind of superconductor. Electrical current is conducted by a rectified current of partons, not electrons. It really exists!}
{2150}{}{一开始我也不敢相信。显然这是一种全新的超导体。电流是由部分子的整流电流传导的，而不是电子。它真的存在！}
#{2151}{}{I've got a question about the stargate.}
{2151}{}{我有个关于星际之门的问题。}
#{2152}{}{I've got another question...}
{2152}{}{我还有一个问题。。。}
#{2200}{}{No, it's not like that. Two stargates constitute two ends of a wormhole that permeates time and space beyond our dimension. Matter cannot travel through wormhole, only energy can. Crystals located in a stargate work like coders and decoders - by accelerating matter to the square of the speed of light they dematerialize it into energy form, by slowing down they reassemble energy into matter. The energy matrix is secured against any shifts on the timeline - in the normal course of events.}
{2200}{}{不，不是那样的。两个星门构成了一个虫洞的两端，这个虫洞渗透了我们维度之外的时空。物质不能穿过虫洞，只有能量可以。位于星门中的晶体就像编码器和解码器一样工作――通过将物质加速到光速的平方，它们将物质去物质化为能量形式，通过减慢它们将能量重新组装成物质。在正常的事件过程中，能量矩阵可以防止时间轴上的任何变化。}
#{2201}{}{Eh... Sure. Back to basics about the gate.}
{2201}{}{呃。。。当然。回到关于大门的基本知识。}
#{2202}{}{Zzzz.... zzzz... Oh, what? Yeah, of course, I'm listening. But now I have to go to take care of something insanely far away from here.}
{2202}{}{Zzzz。。。。zzzz。。。哦，什么？当然，我在听。但现在我得去处理离这里很远的东西。}
#{2203}{}{But according to the theory of relativity, maximum speed equals the speed of light!}
{2203}{}{但是根据相对论，最大速度等于光速！}
#{2204}{}{Hm, OK. So where did it go wrong?}
{2204}{}{嗯，好的。那么哪里出了问题呢？}
#{2250}{}{It's just like ecstasy. For a picosecond, all the nerves in body are overflowing with energy, for a tiny little moment the world is spinning...}
{2250}{}{就像摇头丸一样。一皮秒，身体里所有的神经都充满了能量，一瞬间，世界在旋转。。。}
#{2251}{}{Yeah, I can see that you really enjoy it.}
{2251}{}{是啊，我看得出你很喜欢。}
#{2252}{}{Better than sex?}
{2252}{}{比性更好？}
#{2300}{}{That is what I'm trying to figure out now. Theoretically speaking, if we set off to P3Q119 and manage to hit the solar prominence on the other side of the local sun, it would take us back. But...}
{2300}{}{这就是我现在想弄明白的。从理论上讲，如果我们出发到P3Q119，设法撞到当地太阳另一边的日珥，它就会把我们带回去。但是。。。}
#{2301}{}{Good luck with that. Now tell me about something else, other than that prominence stuff.}
{2301}{}{祝你好运。现在告诉我一些别的，除了突出的东西。}
#{2302}{}{But how would you find out that there are prominences taking place on the local sun?}
{2302}{}{但是你怎么知道在当地的太阳上有日珥呢？}
#{2303}{}{The chance of you hitting a prominence with the same energy is minimal.}
{2303}{}{你用同样的能量击中日珥的几率很小。}
#{2350}{}{What do you mean?}
{2350}{}{什么意思？}
#{2351}{}{You could travel further into the future and witness the evolution of mankind!}
{2351}{}{你可以深入未来，见证人类的进化！}
#{2352}{}{You could go back in time and prevent the apocalypse!}
{2352}{}{你可以回到过去阻止世界末日！}
#{2400}{}{Well, thanks for the chat.}
{2400}{}{好吧，谢谢你的聊天。}
#{2401}{}{Ho.}
{2401}{}{呵。}
#{2450}{}{Well there, you've got talent! Show me more!}
{2450}{}{好吧，你很有天赋！给我看更多！}
#{2451}{}{No no.}
{2451}{}{不，不。}
#{2500}{}{Yes, it is.}
{2500}{}{是的，是的。}
#{2501}{}{Now I want to ask about...}
{2501}{}{现在我想问一下。。。}
#{2502}{}{I've got a question about the stargate.}
{2502}{}{我有个关于星际之门的问题。}
#{2503}{}{It was nice talking to you. Take care.}
{2503}{}{很高兴和你谈话。当心。}
#{2550}{}{It could be weapons reinforced with naquadah.}
{2550}{}{可能是用纳夸达加固的武器。}
#{2551}{}{Yeah, it is likely. Could be?}
{2551}{}{是的，很有可能。可以是？}
#{2552}{}{Teal17c said that it looks like a Goa17uld attack aftermath.}
{2552}{}{蒂尔克说这看起来像是果阿的袭击。}
#{2600}{}{And how do you explain increased concentration of neutrinos?}
{2600}{}{你如何解释中微子浓度的增加？}
#{2601}{}{Neutrinos. Bikers. That's a clear case of URCA process!}
{2601}{}{中微子。骑自行车的。这是一个明显的URCA过程！}
#{2602}{}{All right, I give up. What do you think about it?}
{2602}{}{好吧，我放弃。你觉得怎么样？}
#{2650}{}{Jaffas are fanatic Goa17ulds warriors.}
{2650}{}{贾法是狂热的果阿战士。}
#{2651}{}{Now, the question rises...}
{2651}{}{现在，问题来了。。。}
#{2652}{}{Another topic, please.}
{2652}{}{另一个话题。}
#{2700}{}{Goa17ulds? A race of alien parasites, whose one and only life goal is to conquer Earth.}
{2700}{}{果阿ULD？一种外星寄生虫，其唯一的生活目标是征服地球。}
#{2701}{}{Another question...}
{2701}{}{另一个问题。。。}
#{2750}{}{The time shift was caused by the increase of energy in the formula transferred by the wormhole. The solar prominence that hit us is responsible for the energy increase.}
{2750}{}{时间偏移是由虫洞传递的公式中能量的增加引起的。撞击我们的日珥是能量增加的原因。}
#{2751}{}{Ah... I see. Now, tell me about...}
{2751}{}{啊。。。我懂了。现在，告诉我。。。}
#{2752}{}{And how will you get back?}
{2752}{}{你怎么回来？}
#{2753}{}{Could the time shift be of some use?}
{2753}{}{时差有什么用吗？}
#{2800}{}{Yes, but we already know that under certain circumstances these restrictions can be bypassed.}
{2800}{}{是的，但我们已经知道，在某些情况下，这些限制是可以绕过的。}
#{2801}{}{The screenplay doesn't say HOW, I assume?}
{2801}{}{我想剧本没说怎么演？}
#{2802}{}{OK, and now I want to ask about...}
{2802}{}{好的，现在我想问一下。。。}
#{2850}{}{Some other questions?}
{2850}{}{还有其他问题吗？}
#{2851}{}{Maybe I missed something...}
{2851}{}{也许我错过了什么。。。}
#{2852}{}{Well, not really.}
{2852}{}{嗯，不太可能。}
#{2900}{}{Not better, just different.}
{2900}{}{不是更好，只是不同。}
#{2901}{}{If you say so.}
{2901}{}{如果你这样说。}
#{2950}{}{It's just a theory, but according to our preliminary indications, the local sun is the same type as ours sun. If I could capture its tachyonic and neutrino radiation, I could create a model on my computer, with which I could base my prominence predictions.}
{2950}{}{这只是一个理论，但根据我们的初步迹象，当地的太阳和我们的太阳是同一类型的。如果我能捕捉到它的超光速和中微子辐射，我就可以在我的电脑上建立一个模型，用它来预测日珥。}
#{2951}{}{Well good luck with that.}
{2951}{}{祝你好运。}
#{2952}{}{No von Neumann cellular computer has required performance.}
{2952}{}{没有冯・诺依曼蜂窝式计算机需要性能。}
#{3000}{}{Damn, you're probably right, but what should I do? Half a lifetime spent in special forces has taught me never to give up.}
{3000}{}{妈的，你可能是对的，但我该怎么办？在特种部队度过的半辈子教会了我永不放弃。}
#{3001}{}{Then I wish you much success.}
{3001}{}{那我祝你成功。}
#{3050}{}{But now I am more interested in how to get back.}
{3050}{}{但现在我更感兴趣的是如何回去。}
#{3051}{}{Well, I cannot help you with that. Goodbye.}
{3051}{}{我帮不了你。再见。}
#{3052}{}{Maybe it could be of some other use.}
{3052}{}{也许还有别的用处。}
#{3100}{}{If we changed past, the present would not happen, we couldn't meet and thus won't be able to change the past.}
{3100}{}{如果我们改变了过去，现在就不会发生，我们就不能相遇，也就无法改变过去。}
#{3101}{}{Then we would meet and you could go back and change the past...}
{3101}{}{然后我们见面，你可以回去改变过去。。。}
#{3102}{}{Wh-what? My head hurts already.}
{3102}{}{什么什么？我的头已经痛了。}
#{3150}{}{Well, we cannot do anything about it now, I'm afraid, so it's pointless to waste time on it. It's now more important for us to go back home.}
{3150}{}{嗯，恐怕我们现在无能为力，所以在这上面浪费时间是没有意义的。现在对我们来说回家更重要。}
#{3151}{}{Is it possible?}
{3151}{}{有可能吗？}
#{3152}{}{Yes of course. Thanks for the chat.}
{3152}{}{当然可以。谢谢你的聊天。}
#{3200}{}{Well... It is possible. Of course that would mean...}
{3200}{}{好。。。这是可能的。当然那意味着。。。}
#{3201}{}{What?}
{3201}{}{什么？}
#{3250}{}{Ha ha ha. You have to realize that only scientists get scientific jokes. [Whispering.] You'd better not tell any in front of the Colonel.}
{3250}{}{哈哈哈。你必须认识到，只有科学家才能得到科学笑话。你最好别在上校面前说。}
#{3251}{}{OK. I've got some other questions.}
{3251}{}{好 啊。我还有其他问题。}
#{3252}{}{Sure, I get it. bye.}
{3252}{}{当然，我明白了。再见。}
#{3300}{}{Eh... Well... Of course it does. By quantum-photonically rearranging tachyonic quartoillusory tetraoxidal particles through a turboalcalic metanucleus.}
{3300}{}{呃。。。好。。。当然了。通过量子光子学重排超光速四元四氧化二粒子通过一个涡轮alcalic中核。}
#{3301}{}{So, it does not.}
{3301}{}{所以，事实并非如此。}
#{3302}{}{Do you mean Kirk's transhilarious hocus-pocus effect?}
{3302}{}{你是说柯克的超搞笑的胡说八道效应？}
#{3350}{}{OK. Bye then.}
{3350}{}{好 啊。再见。}
#{3351}{}{Goodbye.}
{3351}{}{再见。}
#{3400}{}{[An awkward pause.] Well... [Another awkward pause.] Computer, activate the program "Plot creation", and do it quickly!}
{3400}{}{[尴尬的停顿]嗯。。。[又是一个尴尬的停顿]电脑，启动“绘图创建”程序，然后快速完成！}
#{3401}{}{I don't need to know anything else. I better retreat, before I got killed by some ugly alien showing up from thin air.}
{3401}{}{我不需要知道任何其他事情。我最好撤退，不然我会被从稀薄的空气中出现的丑陋的外星人杀死。}
#{3450}{}{Eh... Yes, of course! Among other things, this effect causes the immortality of the main characters.}
{3450}{}{呃。。。是的，当然！除此之外，这一效应导致了主要人物的不朽。}
#{3451}{}{Whatever.}
{3451}{}{无论什么。}
#{3500}{}{Thanks. For nothing.}
{3500}{}{谢谢。什么都没有。}
#{3501}{}{Goodbye.}
{3501}{}{再见。}
#{3550}{}{So I will try to construct a deoxyribonucleic logical unit using a quaternary system of nitrogen-containing bases A,C,G,T.}
{3550}{}{所以我将尝试用含氮碱基a，C，G，T的四元体系来构建脱氧核糖核逻辑单元。}
#{3551}{}{I'm no scientist, but I'm sure that you have no chance.}
{3551}{}{我不是科学家，但我肯定你没有机会。}
#{3600}{}{Look, it's simple. If you went back in time and killed your father, you wouldn't be born, so you couldn't go back in time and kill your father. He would survive, you would be born, and you could go back and kill him. Then, of course, you wouldn't be born and so forth. It's called the time paradox. It can destroy space--or at least your mind.}
{3600}{}{听着，很简单。如果你回到过去杀了你的父亲，你就不会出生，所以你不能回到过去杀了你的父亲。他会活下来，你会出生，你可以回去杀了他。那么，当然，你就不会出生了等等。这叫做时间悖论。它可以破坏空间――或者至少是你的大脑。}

#{3602}{}{It got me thinking, what if I kill YOUR father?!}
{3602}{}{这让我想，如果我杀了你父亲怎么办？！}
#{3603}{}{It got me thinking, what if I kill YOUR father?!}
{3603}{}{这让我想，如果我杀了你父亲怎么办？！}
#{3604}{}{I am safe - "mater semper certa est, pater incertus."}
{3604}{}{“我很安全，”我的父亲说}
#{3605}{}{Why does this never happen to Kirk?}
{3605}{}{为什么柯克从来没有这样过？}
#{3606}{}{[Think about it.] Woah!}
{3606}{}{[想想看]哇！}
#{3650}{}{That there was actually no war! The destruction around us - it wasn't caused by people. Goa17ulds did it!}
{3650}{}{实际上没有战争！我们周围的破坏不是由人造成的。果阿乌尔德做到了！}
#{3651}{}{Why all the myths about the war, then?}
{3651}{}{为什么所有关于战争的神话，那么？}
#{3652}{}{Sure. It's always good to have someone to blame for it.}
{3652}{}{当然。有人为此责怪总是好的。}
#{3700}{}{Dumbass!}
{3700}{}{笨蛋！}
#{3701}{}{You cow!}
{3701}{}{你这牛！}
#{3702}{}{Whatever.}
{3702}{}{无论什么。}
#{3750}{}{It was just an example!}
{3750}{}{这只是一个例子！}
#{3751}{}{OK, OK. So there is no way to use the phenomenon. How do you get back then?}
{3751}{}{好的，好的。所以没有办法利用这种现象。那你怎么回来？}
#{3752}{}{OK. Enough with examples!}
{3752}{}{好 啊。例子够多了！}
#{3800}{}{It was clearly just a cover-up. The government was trying to avoid panic in the last minute.}
{3800}{}{这显然只是一种掩饰。政府试图在最后一刻避免恐慌。}
#{3801}{}{Well, and where did the aliens go now?}
{3801}{}{那么，外星人现在去了哪里？}
#{3850}{}{You should tell me. Maybe they went home after the destruction of Earth. Or maybe they are here somewhere, but hidden. Besides, it's just a theory.}
{3850}{}{你应该告诉我。也许他们在地球毁灭后回家了。或者他们就在这里的某个地方，但是隐藏着。再说，这只是个理论。}
#{3851}{}{You should tell me. Maybe they went home after the destruction of Earth. Or maybe they are here somewhere, but hidden. Besides, it's just a theory.}
{3851}{}{你应该告诉我。也许他们在地球毁灭后回家了。或者他们就在这里的某个地方，但是隐藏着。再说，这只是个理论。}
#{3852}{}{OK, I'm going to look for them. I will look under each and every rock in the whole wasteland. Wish me luck!}
{3852}{}{好的，我去找他们。我要察看全旷野的磐石。祝我好运！}
#{3900}{}{This deadly jibber jabber doesn't do you any good.}
{3900}{}{这种致命的胡说八道对你没有任何好处。}
