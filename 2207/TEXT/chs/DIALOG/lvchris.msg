{224}{010}{我想问别的问题。}

{241}{025}{那你打算怎么办？}

### {250}{}{[He ponders] Don't know. I tried everything. It's obvious I'm the best choice for her. But she and this Dallas are always talking! And she likes to talk, as you probably noticed. Unlike me. Talking is not my strongest feat. If it continues like this, I might have some accident with Dallas. So, I need to convince her. Maybe give her a present. Something valuable. She likes smelly things, for example. I understand nothing in them.}
{250}{}{[他沉思]不知道。我什么都试过了。很明显我是她最好的选择。但她和这个达拉斯总是在说话！她喜欢说话，你可能注意到了。不像我，说话不是我最擅长的事。如果继续这样下去，我可能会在达拉斯发生一些意外。所以，我需要说服她。也许给她一份礼物。有价值的东西。例如，她喜欢有臭味的东西。我什么都不懂。}

{260}{}{[克里斯托弗高兴了一点]很高兴和你做生意！和他们谈谈。或者给我送礼物给米农。我会给你一把枪作为奖励。甚至可能是一些罕见的原型。}
### {262}{}{[Christopher gets a little happier] It's a pleasure doing business with you! Talk to them. Or bring me the present for Mignon. I'll give you a gun as a reward. Maybe even some rare prototype. But first, you need to get inside. Talk to old man Schwein near the entrance. He'll make even a Chimera a member of Livos, in exchange for batteries or some rarity.}
{262}{}{[克里斯托弗高兴了一点]很高兴和你做生意！和他们谈谈。或者给我送礼物给米农。我会给你一把枪作为奖励。甚至可能是一些罕见的原型。但首先，你需要进去。和入口附近的施温老人谈谈。他甚至会让奇美拉成为利沃斯的一员，以换取电池或一些稀有物品。}
### {261}{999}{Great. Getting to work.}
{261}{999}{太棒了开始工作。}

{280}{}{达拉斯能说会道。他冷静、聪明。把文字融入故事。可以让别人为他做点什么。他在玩自己的游戏，试图从我这里偷走米农。}
### {281}{025}{And what are you going to do about it?}
{281}{025}{你打算怎么办？}

### {290}{}{Did you talk to Mignon and Dallas? Or - did you find a valuable present?}
