### {201}{}{Hi there.}
{201}{}{你好。}
### {202}{}{Hey, hey! These guys were just hooligans. I didn't want problems and turned a blind eye to their tricks. What else could I do? I am also a victim of circumstances. But killing guys... Let me say I didn't see anything, and you just leave, okay?}
{202}{}{嘿，嘿！这些家伙只是流氓。我不想遇到麻烦，对他们的把戏视而不见。我还能做什么？我也是环境的受害者。但是杀人。。。让我说我什么都没看到，你就走吧，好吗？}

{224}{}{你真不太好。这个镇上的每个拾荒者都认识我，而你只是一个来自荒原的陌生人。所以在我呼救之前，先离开汽车旅馆。}

### {230}{}{(scrapes the bottlecaps under the table in amazement) I didn't think you were serious... yes, these guys have raised a fuss in our quiet town. It's been a long time since it's been so lively here. But the whole city got an excellent welding from them.}
{230}{}{（惊讶地刮桌子下面的瓶子）我不认为你是认真的。。。是的，这些家伙在我们安静的小镇上引起了骚动。这里已经很久没有这么热闹了。但整个城市都从他们那里得到了极好的焊接。}
### {231}{}{What are you talking about? What kind of welding?}
{231}{}{你在说什么？什么类型的焊接？}
### {232}{}{Yes, almost any institution in the city got something of its own. In my motel, for example, there is not a single empty seat left. Almost all the drinks were drunk at the bar. And Mr. Kogan was counting on some contracts. The city lived for a whole week at the expense of all this mess with slaves.}
{232}{}{是的，这个城市几乎所有的机构都有自己的特色。例如，在我的汽车旅馆里，已经没有一个空座位了。酒吧里几乎所有的饮料都喝光了。Kogan先生指望着一些合同。这座城市生活了整整一个星期，代价是奴隶们一团糟。}
### {233}{}{Who are these slaveholders?}

{238}{}{你对那里的焊接有什么看法？}
### {239}{}{I think it's time for me to hit the road.}
{239}{}{我想是时候上路了。}

#Room

### {252}{}{Tell me about the numbers.}
{252}{}{告诉我数字。}
### {253}{}{A room for one person. Moderately *reliable* lock. The bed and furniture are attached, but I do not accept claims to cleanliness. At night, the lighting turns on in the corridor. The most important advantage is protection. No bandit will get through here so easily. So, you can sleep peacefully.}
{253}{}{一个人住的房间。适度*可靠*锁定。床和家具都是附的，但我不接受关于清洁的说法。晚上，走廊里的灯亮了。最重要的优点是保护。没有哪个土匪能这么轻易地通过这里。所以，你可以安然入睡。}
### {254}{}{Is this business really in demand?}

### {256}{}{How long have you been running this motel?}
{256}{}{你经营这家汽车旅馆多久了？}
### {257}{}{I came here a few years ago, like many others, hoping to earn some caps. Then the city needed a motel, and I thought that this could get more than a dirty and unsafe mine.}
{257}{}{我几年前来到这里，和其他许多人一样，希望能获得一些帽子。然后这个城市需要一家汽车旅馆，我想这不仅仅是一个肮脏和不安全的矿井。}
### {258}{}{It's weird that you call it a motel.}
{258}{}{你叫它汽车旅馆真奇怪。}
### {259}{}{I don't know. So it happened. The Old Town is full of garages and auto repair shops. And caravanners use these hefty trailers from pickups.}
{259}{}{我不知道。事情就这样发生了。老城区到处都是车库和汽车修理店。房车司机使用皮卡车上的重型拖车。}
### {260}{}{Okay, that was a ridiculous question.}
{260}{}{好吧，这是一个荒谬的问题。}
### {261}{}{Tempting. I'll think about this proposal.}

{264}{}{哇，你可以为一个安静、平静的睡眠付出很多。一晚多少钱？}
### {265}{}{Oh, you should know about the wonderful adobe houses in my village... And how much does a night in this bedbug cost?}
{265}{}{哦，你应该知道我村里那些很棒的土坯房。。。在这个臭虫里住一晚要多少钱？}

### {271}{}{It's too expensive. I'm going to sleep under the open sky.}
{271}{}{太贵了。我要睡在开阔的天空下。}

### {280}{}{Hey, someone is being raped in the next room!}
{280}{}{嘿，隔壁房间有人被强奸了！}
### {281}{}{It's none of your business. If you don't want problems, then pass by and keep quiet.}
{281}{}{这不关你的事。如果你不想遇到问题，那就过去保持安静。}
### {282}{}{And you're not going to do anything?}
{282}{}{你什么都不做？}
### {283}{}{So you're with them for one thing, or what?}
{283}{}{所以你和他们在一起是为了一件事，还是什么？}
### {284}{}{The girl herself has sunk to such a life. If she didn't want to, she wouldn't have gotten involved with these guys. Don't feel sorry for her. And nothing terrible is happening. The guys will play and let them go... I'm telling you - it's none of your business!}
{284}{}{这个女孩自己也适应了这样的生活。如果她不想，她就不会和这些家伙扯上关系。不要为她感到难过。没有什么可怕的事情发生。伙计们会玩，然后让他们走。。。我告诉你，这不关你的事！}
### {285}{}{Damn, I can't just leave it like that.}
{285}{}{该死，我不能就这样算了。}
### {286}{}{Ah, well, then I really should pass by.}
{286}{}{啊，好吧，那我真的应该路过。}
