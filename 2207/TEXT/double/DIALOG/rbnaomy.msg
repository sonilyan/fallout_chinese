### {252}{}{Uh... Didn't I tell you? I sent him some, er, kid, with an assignment from the Hog himself. Allegedly. The coast is clear, no one would stop you. And I'll stay and watch over your ex-colleagues.}
{252}{}{嗯我没告诉你吗？我给他寄了一些，呃，孩子，还有猪自己的任务。据称海岸是畅通的，没有人会阻止你。我会留下来照顾你的前同事。 -- Uh... Didn't I tell you? I sent him some, er, kid, with an assignment from the Hog himself. Allegedly. The coast is clear, no one would stop you. And I'll stay and watch over your ex-colleagues.}


### {260}{999}{[she looks surprised] Who can even think about complaining in this paradise? We have the best kind of stability here. You have sealed us off from the outside world, so nothing could prevent us from working for the greater good. If you didn't visit us, we wouldn't even know about the changes in local management! Ahem... By the way, the changes are happening very often lately. We are worried, you know... }
{260}{999}{[她看起来很惊讶]在这个天堂里，谁能想到抱怨呢？我们这里有最好的稳定性。你把我们与外界隔绝了，所以没有什么能阻止我们为更大的利益而工作。如果你不来看我们，我们甚至不会知道当地管理层的变化！啊。。。顺便说一下，这些变化最近经常发生。我们很担心，你知道。。。 -- [she looks surprised] Who can even think about complaining in this paradise? We have the best kind of stability here. You have sealed us off from the outside world, so nothing could prevent us from working for the greater good.

### {261}{999}{Don't worry about it. By the way, as a thank you for your work, I thought I'd let you relax a little. Food, drink, and girls for everyone. Only don't do drugs, geniuses. Enjoy your time!}
{261}{999}{别担心。顺便说一句，为了感谢你的工作，我想让你放松一下。给每个人的食物、饮料和女孩。只是不要吸毒，天才。享受你的时光！ -- Don't worry about it. By the way, as a thank you for your work, I thought I'd let you relax a little. Food, drink, and girls for everyone. Only don't do drugs, geniuses. Enjoy your time!}
### {262}{999}{I see you are a little sarcastic, aren't you? I'm not a fucking Hog! Let's see how you'd like to work for a week on water and rat meat! Say thank you to that big loud mouth of yours, bitch!}
{262}{999}{我看你有点讽刺，不是吗？我不是他妈的猪！让我们看看你想如何在水和老鼠肉上工作一周！对你那张大嘴巴说声谢谢，婊子！ -- I see you are a little sarcastic, aren't you? I'm not a fucking Hog! Let's see how you'd like to work for a week on water and rat meat! Say thank you to that big loud mouth of yours, bitch!}

### {271}{028}{I know enough chemistry to understand that. I could, for example, try to prolong the duration time of effects through the use of enzymatic inhibitors... Of course, it will take more time for me, but in the end, it would raise a question - do I even need you? And you will lose everything you have now...}
{271}{028}{我知道足够多的化学知识来理解这一点。例如，我可以尝试通过使用酶抑制剂来延长效果的持续时间。。。当然，这对我来说需要更多的时间，但最终，这会引发一个问题――我甚至需要你吗？你会失去你现在拥有的一切。。。 -- I know enough chemistry to understand that. I could, for example, try to prolong the duration time of effects through the use of enzymatic inhibitors... Of course, it will take more time for me, but in the end, it would raise a question - do I even need you? And you will lose everything you have now...}
### {272}{999}{I'm not good at chemistry, but I'm pretty good at people. You love this job, I can see that. And you would be glad to take some challenge. To improve the drug and lessen the side effects... To prove that you are worthy of your father's legacy, that you are a great scientist! If you have to spend all your life here, isn't it better to at least have fun with it? Not to mention that I can make your existence here very, very painful. We wouldn't want that, right?}
{272}{999}{我不擅长化学，但我对人很在行。你喜欢这份工作，我看得出来。你很乐意接受一些挑战。为了改善药物并减少副作用。。。证明你配得上你父亲的遗产，证明你是一位伟大的科学家！如果你不得不在这里度过你的一生，至少在这里玩得开心不是更好吗？更不用说我会让你在这里的生活变得非常痛苦。我们不会想要那样的，对吧？ -- I'm not good at chemistry, but I'm pretty good at people.

{274}{}{如果我有时间陪你，我会让你趴在桌子旁，给你看一个真正的男人。让Drop变得更好符合你的利益。想想看。 -- If I had time for you, I would bend you over the table and show you a real man. It's in your interest to make the Drop better. Think about it.}


### {280}{999}{[her sarcastic face becomes blank] Well... Looks like I don't have much of a choice, do I? Okay, I'll do it. For my father. I have some theories... The first results will be in a month.}
