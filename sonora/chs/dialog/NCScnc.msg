### {221}{}{I am offered to teach children to read and write. It's an unusual experience. But it's better than messing around on a plantation. I am not allowed to do more serious research yet. And it's annoying, because I used to manage several serious projects.}

Many simply do not deserve it. And if they deserve it, then because of stupidity they are not able to properly dispose of the received good.}
{224}{}{起初，我被他们对知识的渴望所吸引。但他们的善良令人震惊。不可能如此不分青红皂白地帮助每个人并分享知识。许多人根本不配得到它。如果他们应得，那么由于愚蠢，他们无法妥善处理收到的货物。}
