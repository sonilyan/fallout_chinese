### {102}{}{Jack is in front of you.}
{102}{}{杰克在你前面。}
### {103}{}{And this is your house? A little old-fashioned, but peaceful. I like it here.}
{103}{}{这是你的房子吗？有点过时，但很平和。我喜欢这里。}
### {104}{}{And you've done well! I have seen so many plants only in Casa Nueva.}
{104}{}{你做得很好！我只在努瓦之家见过这么多植物。}
### {105}{}{Just don't tell me we have to climb into some hole again.}
{105}{}{只是不要告诉我我们必须再次爬进某个洞里。}
### {106}{}{Phoenix... Although I grew up here, and somehow I don't want to go back.}
{106}{}{凤凰虽然我在这里长大，但不知怎么的，我不想回去了。}

### {200}{}{Who are you? What do you need?}
{200}{}{你是谁？你需要什么？}
### {201}{}{It doesn't matter. Just sit there and be quiet.}
{201}{}{没关系。只是坐在那里，保持安静。}
### {202}{}{Don't make any noise, I'm not here quite "legally". Why are they keeping you locked up?}
{202}{}{别吵闹，我不是“合法”来的。他们为什么把你关起来？}
### {203}{}{Is this some kind of trick to loosen my tongue? I've already told you everything during the interrogation! I was hired by merchants to explore these lands. They hoped for the opening of new caravan routes. That's all. Leave me alone!}
{203}{}{这是什么让我放松舌头的把戏吗？审讯的时候我已经告诉你了！我受雇于商人勘探这些土地。他们希望开辟新的商队路线。仅此而已。别管我！}
### {204}{}{Sounds unconvincing.}
{204}{}{听起来难以令人信服。}
### {205}{}{And what else do you expect in these barren lands? In the north, no one has any idea that a whole military fort is located here.}
{205}{}{在这些贫瘠的土地上，你还能期待什么？在北方，没有人知道这里有一整座军事堡垒。}
### {206}{}{I believe you. Do you want to run away from here? I could use a partner.}
{206}{}{我相信你。你想逃离这里吗？我可以找个搭档。}
### {207}{}{Well, well. In your position, there are not many lies. Stay here and don't make too much noise.}
{207}{}{嗯，嗯。在你的立场上，谎言并不多。呆在这里，不要发出太大的噪音。}
### {208}{}{I don't know if I can trust you, but there's nothing to lose. If I stay here, they'll hang me anyway. Although without weapons and armor, I will be of little use. Do you know where they have a warehouse?}
{208}{}{我不知道我是否能信任你，但没有什么可失去的。如果我留在这里，他们无论如何都会绞死我。虽然没有武器和盔甲，我也没什么用。你知道他们在哪里有仓库吗？}

{209}{}{一路上我们会解决的。来吧}

### {230}{}{You should hide your weapon.}
{230}{}{你应该把武器藏起来。}
### {231}{}{Sounds like a pretty bad idea. Okay, I'll take it away. Until the first occasion.}
{231}{}{听起来是个很糟糕的主意。好吧，我把它拿走。直到第一次。}
### {232}{}{It's not worth showing your hostility now.}
{232}{}{现在不值得表现出你的敌意。}
### {233}{}{We'll have to take off this armor.}
{233}{}{我们必须脱下这件盔甲。}
### {234}{}{OK. It's really quite stuffy in there.}
{234}{}{好的。那里真的很闷。}
### {235}{}{That's good.}
{235}{}{这很好。}
### {236}{}{Wait. Are you going to raise the alarm with the whole crowd? Well, no, I'd rather try to escape alone.}
{236}{}{等待你要向全体群众发出警报吗？不，我宁愿一个人逃跑。}
### {237}{}{Are you sure? Your business.}

### {238}{}{Okay, I'll leave the team in a safe place and come back for you.}
{238}{}{好吧，我会把队伍留在一个安全的地方，然后回来接你。}

### {250}{}{What do you know about this place?}
{250}{}{你对这个地方了解多少？}
### {251}{}{These places are unfamiliar to me. But I think it's not worth staying here.}
{251}{}{这些地方我不熟悉。但我觉得呆在这里不值得。}
### {252}{}{I see.}
{252}{}{我明白了。}
### {253}{}{Hermosillo is the ruins of a very old town. There were no residents here until the Mexican troops founded their fort. Apart from the old ruins, the military and a few civilians, there is nothing remarkable here.}
{253}{}{赫莫西洛是一座古老城镇的废墟。在墨西哥军队建立堡垒之前，这里没有居民。除了古老的废墟、军队和一些平民，这里没有什么了不起的。}
### {254}{}{This is Phoenix, the biggest city I know of. But don't think that you can relax here. This city is treacherous.}
{254}{}{这是凤凰城，我所知道的最大的城市。但不要以为你可以在这里放松。这座城市危机四伏。}
### {255}{}{Poor neighborhoods of Phoenix. I wouldn't live here. In any case, keep the gun close to your hands.}
{255}{}{菲尼克斯的贫困社区。我不会住在这里。在任何情况下，都要把枪靠近你的手。}
### {256}{}{Sewage system? Well... listen, what are we even doing here?}
{256}{}{污水系统？好听着，我们在这里干什么？}
### {257}{}{I've been here a few times, but I've never been to the tinsmiths' base. They don't like newcomers and consider them second-class people. However, if you get along with technology, you will quickly find a common language with them.}
{257}{}{我来过这里几次，但从来没有去过铁匠铺的基地。他们不喜欢新来的人，认为他们是二流人。然而，如果你与技术打交道，你会很快找到与他们通用的语言。}
### {258}{}{A small oasis on the trade route. Literally. The water pump is still operating here, so the caravans willingly stop for the night. There won't be any special problems with the locals if you don't meddle in their affairs yourself.}
{258}{}{贸易路线上的一片小绿洲。字面上水泵还在这里工作，所以大篷车愿意停下来过夜。如果你不亲自干预当地人的事务，他们就不会有什么特别的问题。}
### {259}{}{This is a peaceful, but semi-closed town. Mostly agave and maize are grown here... listen, further west is Puerto Penasco. It would be nice to go there right now. It won't take long.}
{259}{}{这是一个宁静但半封闭的小镇。这里主要种植龙舌兰和玉米...听着，再往西就是佩纳斯科港。现在去那里就好了。这不会花很长时间。}
### {260}{}{I've never been to these parts. We've gone too far. Hey, I'll never get to Puerto Penasco like this!}
{260}{}{我从来没有去过这些地方。我们走得太远了。嘿，我再也不会这样去佩纳斯科港了！}
### {261}{}{The Church of the Fire Worshippers is a local landmark. Although these people are pious, they also know how to hold weapons in their hands.}
{261}{}{火崇拜者教堂是当地的地标。尽管这些人很虔诚，但他们也知道如何将武器握在手中。}
### {262}{}{This place is creepy. It seems as if a pair of eyes are staring at you through the cracks.}
{262}{}{这个地方令人毛骨悚然。好像有一双眼睛正透过缝隙盯着你。}
### {263}{}{Are you kidding? There is no brotherhood anymore!}
{263}{}{你在开玩笑吗？再也没有兄弟情谊了！}
### {264}{}{The Brotherhood of Steel runs everything here. Great guys, if you don't piss them off. Keep your gun in your holster and watch your tongue, they don't like upstarts and provocateurs.}
{264}{}{钢铁兄弟会掌管着这里的一切。伟大的家伙，如果你不激怒他们。把枪放在枪套里，注意你的舌头，他们不喜欢暴发户和挑衅者。}
### {265}{}{Some call this place the Devil's City. They say there are the living dead roaming the streets here or something like that. Listen, do we have to go there?}
{265}{}{有人称这里为魔鬼城。他们说有活死人在这里的街道上游荡或类似的事情。听着，我们必须去那里吗？}
### {266}{}{It turns out that the monks have been hiding this refuge from the rest of the city for many years? Damn, what other secrets do they keep in their dark storerooms?}
{266}{}{事实证明，僧侣们多年来一直在这个避难所躲避城市的其他地方？该死，他们在黑暗的储藏室里还有什么秘密？}

### {300}{}{Tell me about yourself?}
{300}{}{告诉我你自己的情况？}
### {301}{}{There's nothing to tell. Call me Jack, if you like. I'm here by order of the caravaneers from the north. They needed guys to scout the southern lands. They hoped to find settlements suitable for trade here. But it seems that the idea is doomed to failure.}
{301}{}{没什么好说的。如果你愿意，叫我杰克。我是奉北方商队的命令来的。他们需要人来侦察南方的土地。他们希望在这里找到适合贸易的定居点。但这个想法似乎注定要失败。}
### {302}{}{Why were you locked up in prison?}
{302}{}{你为什么被关在监狱里？}
### {303}{}{The military did not believe my explanations and decided that I was a spy. In their opinion, apparently, enemies are all around.}
{303}{}{军方不相信我的解释，认定我是间谍。在他们看来，敌人显然无处不在。}
### {304}{}{What are your plans now?}
{304}{}{你现在有什么计划？}
### {305}{}{First we need to get out of Hermosillo, away from the garrison. And then we'll see.}
{305}{}{首先，我们需要离开赫莫西洛，远离驻军。然后我们拭目以待。}
### {306}{}{Then let's get out of here.}
{306}{}{那我们离开这里吧。}
### {307}{}{And you really can be trusted. Listen, I need to get to Puerto Penasco. This is a small old port on the shore of the Gulf of California. I can't get there alone, maybe we can get there together? I think you will also find a job there.}
{307}{}{你真的值得信任。听着，我要去佩纳斯科港。这是加利福尼亚湾岸边的一个古老的小港口。我不能一个人去，也许我们可以一起去？我想你也会在那里找到工作。}
### {308}{}{And what is there in this port?}
{308}{}{这个港口有什么？}
### {309}{}{My customers are there. After all, I need to report on the work done... But I couldn't find out anything special. It would be good to collect more data for them in Hermosillo.}
{309}{}{我的客户在那里。毕竟，我需要报告所做的工作...但我找不到什么特别的东西。最好能在赫莫西洛为他们收集更多的数据。}
### {310}{}{It looks like it smells like a good profit. Great, I'm in.}
{310}{}{看起来它闻起来像是一笔不错的利润。太好了，我来了。}
### {311}{}{Glad to hear it, partner. You won't regret it.}
{311}{}{很高兴听到，伙计。你不会后悔的。}
### {312}{}{Then we're on our way to Puerto Penasco...}
{312}{}{然后我们在去佩纳斯科港的路上...}
### {313}{}{I'll take you to the port, but if it's a trap, you'll pay cruelly.}
{313}{}{我会带你去港口，但如果这是一个陷阱，你会付出残酷的代价。}
### {314}{}{I'm telling you - this is business. Don't worry, you'll get your interest from the fee too.}
{314}{}{我告诉你，这是生意。别担心，你也会从这笔费用中得到利息的。}
### {315}{}{OK, we're on our way to Puerto Penasco...}
{315}{}{好的，我们正在去佩纳斯科港的路上...}
### {316}{}{Sorry, but we're not on the way.}
{316}{}{对不起，我们不在路上。}
### {317}{}{Okay, whatever you say. In this case, I suggest we get to the nearest settlement, and then we will disperse peacefully.}
{317}{}{好吧，不管你说什么。在这种情况下，我建议我们到最近的定居点，然后和平散去。}
### {318}{}{Okay.}
{318}{}{可以}
### {319}{}{Looks like we've lost it. What are you going to do now?}
{319}{}{看起来我们丢了。你现在打算怎么办？}

### {320}{}{Remind me where you need to get to?}
{320}{}{提醒我你需要去哪里？}
### {321}{}{Puerto Penasco is a port city on the Gulf of California.}
{321}{}{佩纳斯科港是加利福尼亚湾上的一个港口城市。}
### {322}{}{Then let's not waste time.}
{322}{}{那我们就不要浪费时间了。}
### {323}{}{I can't go there right now, sorry.}
{323}{}{对不起，我现在不能去那里。}
### {324}{}{I hasten to disappoint you - one of the ships in Puerto was blown up. This place is no longer inhabited.}
{324}{}{我赶紧让你失望――在波多黎各的一艘船被炸了。这个地方已无人居住。}
### {325}{}{Are you kidding me? I won't believe it until I see it with my own eyes.}
{325}{}{你在开玩笑吗？除非我亲眼看到，否则我不会相信。}
### {326}{}{Okay, then let's go to Puerto.}
{326}{}{好吧，那我们去波多黎各吧。}
### {327}{}{My job is to warn.}
{327}{}{我的工作是警告。}

### {330}{}{Which... What happened here?}
{330}{}{哪一个这里发生了什么？}
### {331}{}{So this is where you were supposed to meet the customer?}
{331}{}{所以你应该在这里见客户？}
### {332}{}{Yes, but... What force could destroy an entire port?}
{332}{}{是的，但是...什么力量可以摧毁整个港口？}
### {333}{}{It looks like the local "caravaneers" were selling something very killer, isn't it?}
{333}{}{看起来当地的“房车客”在卖一些非常致命的东西，不是吗？}
### {334}{}{Wait... okay... let me explain. I did lie a little. I was hired not by the caravaneers, but by the Brotherhood of Steel. And I had to scout not trade routes, but the military potential of the Mexican army. But what difference does it make now? After all, the Brotherhood's post has been destroyed!}
{334}{}{等待可以让我解释一下。我确实撒了一点谎。我不是被车队雇佣的，而是被钢铁兄弟会雇佣的。我不得不侦察的不是贸易路线，而是墨西哥军队的军事潜力。但现在有什么不同？毕竟，兄弟会的职位已经被摧毁了！}
### {335}{}{Oh, yes, someone was left without a fee.}
{335}{}{哦，是的，有人没有收费。}
### {336}{}{Are you laughing? After all, we were left without bottlecaps. Well, this trip turned out to be pointless.}
{336}{}{你在笑吗？毕竟，我们没有瓶子。这次旅行毫无意义。}
### {337}{}{What are you going to do now?}
{337}{}{你现在打算做什么？}
### {338}{}{I don't know. Without the Brotherhood, there will be a decline in these parts, and without the caps, there is no point in me returning to Phoenix. I'll have to wander the wastelands in search of work.}
{338}{}{我不知道。如果没有兄弟会，这些地方就会衰落，如果没有瓶盖，我回到凤凰城就没有意义。我将不得不在荒原上游荡找工作。}
### {339}{}{You know, we should stick together. I need an assistant on the way, and you will surely find a place at the Villa when everything settles down there.}
{339}{}{你知道，我们应该团结在一起。我需要一个助理在路上，当一切稳定下来的时候，你肯定会在维拉找到一个位置。}
### {340}{}{Do you think your relatives will accept me? Well, it's worth a try. It must be great to have your own home and family. Come on, partner. I'll watch your back.}
{340}{}{你认为你的亲戚会接受我吗？嗯，值得一试。拥有自己的家和家人一定很棒。来吧，伙计。我会照顾你的。}
### {341}{}{Come on, Jack.}
{341}{}{来吧，杰克。}
### {342}{}{You're right. You're totally fucked. I think from now on our paths diverge.}
{342}{}{你说得对。你彻底完蛋了。我认为从现在起我们的道路会出现分歧。}
### {343}{}{Will you leave me like this? After everything we've been through together?}
{343}{}{你会这样离开我吗？在我们一起经历了一切之后？}
### {344}{}{Yes. You've proved that you can't be trusted. Give me my things and go your own way.}
{344}{}{对你已经证明了你是不可信任的。把我的东西给我，走你自己的路。}
### {345}{}{And you know, I enjoyed escaping from the blazing Hermosillo with you. I think there will be a place for you at our Villa when everything settles down there.}
{345}{}{你知道，我很喜欢和你一起逃离炽热的赫莫西洛。我想当一切都安定下来的时候，你会在我们的别墅有一个位置。}

### {350}{}{We're here. You'll have to wait a bit while I talk to my customer.}
{350}{}{我们到了。我和我的客户谈话时，你得等一等。}
### {351}{}{Wait a minute, are your customers the Brotherhood of Steel? But you said that...}
{351}{}{等一下，你的客户是钢铁兄弟会吗？但你说过...}
### {352}{}{Yes, yes, I lied about the caravaneers. The Brotherhood of Steel pays excellent caps for exploration of the southern lands... Now wait here, it will take a little time.}
{352}{}{是的，是的，我在车队的事上撒了谎。钢铁兄弟会为南部土地的勘探支付了极好的费用...现在在这里等一下，需要一点时间。}
### {353}{}{[Next]}
{353}{}{[下一个]}
### {354}{}{(Three hours later, Jack comes out to you with a contrite look)}
{354}{}{（三个小时后，杰克带着懊悔的表情向你走来）}
### {355}{}{How did the negotiations go?}
{355}{}{谈判进展如何？}
### {356}{}{These scum don't want to pay! In their opinion, I didn't get any valuable information. I had to tell you about you and my rescue from captivity. And for some reason they were interested in your personality. Go talk to Paladin Latham, he wants to see you. I'll rest here for now.}
{356}{}{这些渣滓不想付钱！在他们看来，我没有得到任何有价值的信息。我不得不告诉你关于你和我从囚禁中获救的事。出于某种原因，他们对你的个性很感兴趣。去和帕拉丁・莱瑟姆谈谈，他想见你。我现在就在这里休息。}
### {357}{}{Okay, Jack. See you later.}
{357}{}{好的，杰克。回头见。}
### {358}{}{The chief of the patrol service wanted to see you. Do you remember?}
{358}{}{巡逻队队长想见你。你还记得吗？}
### {359}{}{Something has changed. Now we are not welcome here. It's better to get out of here while your legs are intact.}
{359}{}{有些事情发生了变化。现在我们在这里不受欢迎。最好在你的腿完好无损的时候离开这里。}
### {360}{}{What's up with the caps? Did they pay you?}
{360}{}{瓶盖怎么了？他们付钱给你了吗？}
### {361}{}{Yes, but they broke your contract. Sorry.}
{361}{}{是的，但他们违反了你的合同。很抱歉}
### {362}{}{S-bitches... Why did I go through so much? It looks like this trip turned out to be pointless.}
{362}{}{S婊子...为什么我经历了这么多？看来这次旅行毫无意义。}
### {363}{}{What are you going to do now, Jack?}
{363}{}{杰克，你现在打算做什么？}
### {364}{}{I don't know. Since the contract with the Brotherhood is broken, and I have no caps, I will have to wander the wastelands in search of work.}
{364}{}{我不知道。由于与兄弟会的合同破裂，我没有上限，我将不得不在荒原上寻找工作。}
### {365}{}{We'll talk about it later.}
{365}{}{我们稍后再谈。}
### {366}{}{No, I couldn't find a common language with Latham.}
{366}{}{不，我找不到与莱瑟姆通用的语言。}
### {367}{}{Jack has temporarily left you.}
{367}{}{杰克暂时离开了你。}
### {368}{}{We didn't have any useful information about Hermosillo. We'll have to go back there to collect more data on the Mexican army.}
{368}{}{我们没有任何关于赫莫西洛的有用信息。我们必须回到那里收集更多关于墨西哥军队的数据。}
