{100}{}{Hey there, stranger. Please take a seat. Tell me then, what can Larry do for you?}
{101}{}{What is this place?}
{102}{}{Nothing, I'll be going now.}
#this place...
{103}{}{You probably wonder why this building is so important. Well, this is my management office. I run the whole
 place from here. We have a storage unit to the west and an ore processing plant to the south, and of course the mine
 itself which is below us.}
{104}{}{Tell me more about the storage unit.}
{105}{}{What can you tell me about the mine?}
{106}{}{What about the ore processing plant?}
{107}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{108}{}{Thanks, that's all I wanted to know.}
#storage unit...
{109}{}{It's used to store processed materials such as coal, iron ore... anything we can dig up and make use of. So
 the output stays here until we sell it or use it for our needs and at the same time it's secured from "dishonest" hands.}
{110}{}{So, your reserves are piled up and safe?}
{111}{}{What about the ore processing plant?}
{112}{}{What can you tell me about the mine?}
{113}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{114}{}{Thanks, that's all I wanted to know.}
#piled up...
{115}{}{Safe... yes. Piled up... not really. You see, reserves were good back in the old days when we had hundreds of
 workers but these days we have less than fifty people working down in the mine. Should I be worried? Yes, the whole
 town depends on the mine income but very few people realize it.}
{116}{}{What's the problem?}
{117}{}{Hard times, huh? See you later, Larry.}
#problem...
{118}{}{Well, it's only natural that people think about the physical demand and the working conditions first, rather
 than the importance of the work itself. But it's quite simple really, keeping the mine working fuels our town economy
 and that allows people to make a living, take that away and nothing much matters.}
{119}{}{What about your workers? They don't seem to be happy with this view.}
{120}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{121}{}{It sure does, gotta go.}
#workers...
{122}{}{Everybody has a choice and no one is forced to work against their will, I can sign that. However, in that kind
 of environment people experience something known as "group thinking". It's a known psychological state where
 someone's mind is more vulnerable to outside influence, accepting information as facts even if they are false. I can't
 blame them, it's a hard work and they try their best to deal with the difficulties they encounter every day. [Sighs.]
 There's nothing more I can say, you'll have to excuse me now.}
{123}{}{Sure thing, Larry.}
#about the mine...
{124}{}{It's very old but it was built to last. Even after hundreds of years, its reserves are holding, at least we think
 they are since there's no way of knowing for sure. What else is special about the mine...? Hm, its tunnels are stretching
 for miles... And a few years ago we built the second mine entrance to make shifting raw materials to the surface more
 efficient, but...}
{125}{}{Go on...}
{126}{}{How can one get down there?}
{127}{}{I have to go. Thanks for the story.}
#go on...
{128}{}{...despite all my efforts we have less workers every year. This situation will eventually lead to the stagnation
 of raw material production. This could be a fatal blow to the town's economy. I can't see any other outcome...}
{129}{}{I see, can I ask you something else?}
{130}{}{It's a tough one. See you later, Larry.}
#ask something else...
{131}{}{Yes, of course. What do you want to know?}
#ore processing plant...
{132}{}{It's that building south of here. We're using it to process the raw materials extracted from the mine, separate
 coal and ore, clean any excess dirt and so on. Later, the processed materials get sorted.}
{133}{}{Tell me more about the storage unit.}
{134}{}{What about the mine, what can you tell me?}
{135}{}{Interesting, tell me something else.}
#one get down...
{136}{}{Only workers and security guards have access because there are many safety concerns and those entering are
 put into a very hostile environment. There's a great danger from natural gas leaks, it's highly flammable and can cause
 an explosion... That's the worst case scenario, which we try to prevent every day.}
{137}{}{Interesting, any accidents so far?}
#
{138}{}{Well, there were a few isolated incidents a couple of years ago, but nothing serious. Accidents happen and the
 mine being so old... If there was any safer way to keep this town running... but there's no alternative, only hard work.}
{139}{}{Yep, let me ask you something else.}
{140}{}{You've got a point. See you later Larry.}
#
{141}{}{Hello again, is there something you want to ask me?}
#
{142}{}{Got any job for me?}
#job1
{143}{}{Yes, one of the ore processing machines broke down, causing processing delays all over the place... It has to
 be repaired as soon as possible, but it will require a new part, which we don't have. I can offer you $1000 for the job,
 interested?}
{144}{}{OK, where can I find that part?}
{145}{}{Not right now, I'll be back.}
#find
{146}{}{As I can recall, there's a town on the west coast, called Philton. There are some machinery shops so I think
 you'll be able to find that part. Watch yourself, I've heard there are bandits all around the town... waiting in
 ambush for those unlucky travelers and caravans. Just watch out!}
{147}{}{Thanks, I will.}
#job not taken
{148}{}{Yes, I still need someone to get a new part for the broken machine. I will pay you $1000 for the job, well?}
{149}{}{OK, where can I find that part?}
{150}{}{Not right now, I'll be back.}
#back, no parts...
{151}{}{I don't see the replacement part I sent you for. Get it and then we'll talk.}
{152}{}{Uh... OK.}
#wrong part...
{153}{}{This looks like the part I need but I don't think it'll work. It's... falling apart. Look! [He shoves the part at you.]
 Either bring me a working module or stop wasting my time! Out!}
{154}{}{Easy man... I'll get you the damn part.}
{155}{}{I bought the damn part and now I want my money!}
#money
{156}{}{[Laughs.] Hmm... Tell you what, I have a thousand... Bullets! Start counting!}
{157}{}{Shit!}
#right part...
{158}{}{[Looking at the part.] Yes, this is the part we need. Looks good... So here's your payment. Now I have to get
 back to work, see you later.}
{159}{}{Sure thing, Larry.}
#dude get two parts...
{160}{}{[Looking at the part.] This is great, it'll fit just perfectly. I'll give you $1400 for the job, you earned it. I'll
 send my workers to install it right away, thanks again.}
{161}{}{Sure thing, Larry.}
#no job
{162}{}{Sorry, nothing at this time.}
{163}{}{Can I ask you something?}
{164}{}{OK, see you later.}
#
{165}{}{About that job...}
#dude touch locker, warnings
{166}{}{Hey, hands off that locker!}
{167}{}{Last warning, stay away from that locker!}
{168}{}{That's it, guards!}
#Dude needs Greg...
{169}{}{Where can I find Greg, the smelter?}
#greg...
{170}{}{Heh, senile old Greg... But the man knows his job. He's also working as a blacksmith. Either way, he can
 work iron, if that's what you are looking for. You can find him just across the street. Anything else?}
{171}{}{Yes, can I ask you something?}
{172}{}{No, thanks.}
#
{173}{}{You think you could fix the machine yourself, just to prove him wrong...}
{174}{}{::(I'll show you.)::}
#
{175}{}{Hey Larry, I can install it for you... I'm good at this.}
{176}{}{[Smiles.] If you know what you're doing, it would mean a lot to me.}
{177}{}{No worries, I can handle it.}
#
{178}{}{I've installed the replacement module...}
{179}{}{Good work, I'm glad that's off my "to do" list. Thanks again.}
{180}{}{Sure thing. Take care.}
#Aston uranium quest, gvar 124 = 2
{181}{}{Do you mine uranium ore?}
#response
{182}{}{No, only coal and iron. Which are also the resources we use to power ourselves. However, there is some on
 the market, but I don't know who the supplier is.}
{183}{}{Well, never mind. Can I ask you something else?}
{184}{}{OK, thanks anyway.}
#processing machine quest...
{185}{}{(I should check what's wrong with the processing machine.)}
