{100}{}{Hello there, what can Dr. Travis do for you?}
{101}{}{What can you tell me about this place?}
{102}{}{Got any medical supplies I could trade for?}
{103}{}{I'm hurt.}
{104}{}{Nothing.}
#about this place
{105}{}{[Clears throat.] Well, big city, lots of people. As you have noticed, most of the locals are workers so every day
 can potentially be a very busy day. Starting from light wounds to broken bones, it's not easy but I have to thank
 sheriff Jerry for giving us all the funds we need. Of course, I've got my assistant, helps me a lot but sometimes...
 it's not enough. That's why I'm always looking for a pair of skilled hands.}
{106}{}{So, Jerry is paying for all the stuff you need?}
{107}{}{Got any medicine I could buy?}
#jerry giving funds...
{108}{}{Yes, he promised he will take care of his people and if Jerry or someone like him wasn't around I doubt we
 could help all of our patients. Takes a lot of guts to take that much responsibility.}
{109}{}{You're right. Let me ask you something else.}
#got any medicals...
{110}{}{Medicine, of course. Here's what I have.}
{111}{}{All right.}
#i'm hurt
{112}{}{OK, let me see. That'll cost you $100.}
{113}{}{OK, let me see. That'll cost you $200.}
{114}{}{OK, let me see. That'll cost you $300.}
{115}{}{You're pretty messed up, it'll cost you $600.}
{116}{}{Hmm, this is a serious wound. That'll cost you $500.}
{117}{}{Here's the money.}
{118}{}{No way doc, that's too much for me.}
{119}{}{Sorry, don't have the money right now.}
#too much...
{120}{}{Then I can't help you. All our citizens have to pay as well, being an outsider doesn't give you any special
 rights here.}
#
{121}{}{Feeling better?}
{122}{}{Much better, thanks doc.}
#
{123}{}{I don't talk with criminals.}
{124}{}{Go away, I don't want to have any business with you.}
#
{125}{}{Thank you for your time, come back if you need any of my services.}
{126}{}{Thanks doc.}
#
{127}{}{Don't do that!}
{128}{}{I'm warning you!}
#
{129}{}{I've received a dose of radiation.}
#radiation < 100
{130}{}{OK, let me see... That'll cost you $100 and one hour in the suspension tank.}
#radiation > 100 <150
{131}{}{Wow, you are in serious trouble, kid. It'll cost you $200 and you will have to spend about two hours in the
 suspension tank.}
# radiation < 150
{132}{}{What were you thinking...? It'll cost you $300 and you will have to spend about two and a half hours in the
 suspension tank. Now hurry!}
#ask something else...
{133}{}{Of course, what's on your mind?}
#dude try to steal from his locker...
{134}{}{Stay away from my locker!}
{135}{}{There's nothing for you in that locker!}
#take another look...
{136}{}{I want to buy some more supplies.}
#going on in town...
{137}{}{What's going on in town?}
#the deahclaw problem...
{138}{}{Well, I really don't have time to chat with my patients. But I've heard somebody saw a deathclaw just outside
 the town. However, I'm more worried about injuries occurring in the mine. Workers complain that the management
 doesn't care about their safety too much. And town patrols often encounter armed bandits near the old fuel station north
 of here so treating gun wounds became my second specialty... That's all I can tell you for now.}
{139}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{140}{}{Thanks doc, it was helpful.}
#sheriff gone...
{141}{}{Not much since we spoke last time. If you don't require any medical attention, there's nothing more I can do
 for you right now.}
{142}{}{Can I ask you something.}
{143}{}{Sure, see you later doc.}
#deathclaws gone...
{144}{}{I heard the deathclaws are gone. Although I don't support violence, this was the only way to keep the people from harm. You have my thanks! Now, can I do something for you?}
{145}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{146}{}{Nope. Nothing at this time.}
#
{147}{}{Can you tell me something about the mine?}
#about the mine...
{148}{}{It's probably the last place on earth you want to be at. The mine is too old and, personally, I don't think it's
 a safe place to work. Workers complain all the time about poor working conditions, some of them even left the town to
 search for a better place to live. One thing is for sure, we need that mine to keep this town running. Without it, it
 wouldn't be long before this place turns to dust.}
{149}{}{So, who owns the mine?}
{150}{}{It's a difficult subject, can I ask you something else?}
{151}{}{Thanks for you time doc, see you later.}
#owns the mine...
{152}{}{Larry. His office is on the west side. [Talking to his assistant.] What, another patient!? Time to go, stay out
 of trouble.}
{153}{}{Will do, see you later doc.}
#else...
{154}{}{Oh sorry, this is not an appropriate time, I've got some work here. Come visit me some other time.}
{155}{}{Sure thing doc.}
#after 106...
{156}{}{Anything else going on in town?}
#
{157}{}{...hey wait. [He's trying to hear something.] You repaired the water pump?! Yes you did, that noise... It was
 really getting on my nerves. Thank you for this stranger. [He searches his desk.] I guess some stimpaks will come in
 handy during your trips through the wasteland. So here you go, I'm sure you'll make good use of them. Take care.}
{158}{}{I will, thanks doc.}
#
{159}{}{I think I did something to that old water pump, at least the sound is not so annoying anymore...}
#random float messages...
{160}{}{Cracked bone, hmm... Looks bad.}
{161}{}{I told him not to go back there...}
{162}{}{He should be careful with that kind of injury.}
{163}{}{...and every time the same thing, will they ever learn?}
{164}{}{Yes, I can remember my first patient, he was screaming!}
{165}{}{...and the other one begged me to give him some painkillers.}
{166}{}{...that was the last time I saw him.}
{167}{}{Oh man, I need a rest.}
{168}{}{Where did I put that needle...}
{169}{}{Where's my aspirin...}
