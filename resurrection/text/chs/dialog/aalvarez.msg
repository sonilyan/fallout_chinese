#{200}{}{You see a merchant surrounded with various goods.}
{200}{}{你看到一个被各种各样商品包围着的商人。}
#{250}{}{You see Alvarez, a local trader. He might never even leave his spot, just so he wouldn't lose any customers.}
{250}{}{你看阿尔瓦雷斯，一个本地商人。他甚至可能永远不会离开他的位置，只是为了不失去任何客户。}

#{404}{}{Let me live.}
{404}{}{让我活下去。}
#{500}{}{Welcome to Alvarez's, wanderer. That's me, and I trade with everything and everyone - strangers, locals, caravans. Anything your eyes see here is for sale.}
{500}{}{欢迎来到阿尔瓦雷斯，流浪者。就是我，我和所有人、陌生人、当地人、商队做生意。你在这里看到的任何东西都是出售的。}
#{501}{}{Welcome to Alvarez's, wanderer. That's me, and I trade with everything and everyone - strangers, locals, caravans. Anything... [He pauses when he sees Lystra.] I hope your friend doesn't think I'll feel honored or something just because someone from the empire paid me a visit. Anyone can see she's from there. It's painfully obvious that she doesn't belong here.}
{501}{}{欢迎来到阿尔瓦雷斯，流浪者。就是我，我和所有人、陌生人、当地人、商队做生意。任何东西...[他看到莱斯特拉时停顿了一下。]我希望你的朋友不会因为帝国的人来拜访我而觉得我很荣幸。很明显，任何人都能看出她不属于这里，她是从那来的。}

#{552}{}{See you.}
{552}{}{回见。}
#{600}{}{I'm not opposed to trading anything - even information. For 300 caps I will tell you everything I know about the city whenever you stop by. Many people come to me, and I overhear much. Trust me, it will be worth it.}
{600}{}{我不反对交易任何东西-甚至是信息。300个瓶盖，我就告诉你这座城市的一切。很多人来找我，我听到了很多。相信我，这是值得的。}

#{602}{}{Alright, here you go. [Give him 300 caps.]}
{602}{}{好的，给你。[给他300个瓶盖。]}
#{603}{}{I think 250 caps would be enough. What do you say? [Give him 250 caps.]}
{603}{}{我想250个瓶盖就够了。你的意思呢？[给他250个瓶盖。]}
#{604}{}{I don't know what I'm paying for, so you won't get more than 200 from me. [Give him 200 caps.]}

#{1500}{}{Head out and shoot some ghouls. But I'm guessing you don't want to get yourself killed. I do have a few of those talismans - people who for various reasons don't want to associate with the Hunters sell them to me. Usually I go and sell them to the Hunters myself when I have a bunch of them. But if you're really keen on getting into their base, I could throw them in with my regular goods for a buyout price. Think of it as a bonus for the paid information. I'm not too fond of the Hunter's Territory anyway, so at least I'll save myself the trip.}
{1500}{}{出去射杀几个僵尸。但我猜你不想自杀。我确实有一些护身符――出于各种原因不想与猎人打交道的人把它们卖给我的。通常我有一堆护身符时，就自己去把它们卖给猎人。但如果你真的想进入他们的基地，我可以以优惠的价格把它们和我的普通商品一起卖掉，就把它看作是对付费信息的奖励吧，反正我也不太喜欢猎人的领地，所以至少我可以省下这次旅行。}

She worked her way up from a waitress in the Wild Paradise to stripper and up to a whore. William met her there and bought her off. I'm not sure you could consider that an improvement. William doesn't let his women leave the house much, and they say he's very strict with them. I'd say it's pretty wise of him, a woman can blow away an entire fortune in a moment.}
{1600}{}{多琳和威廉一起从洛斯阿拉莫斯来到这里，那是他们曾经住过的地方。对她了解不多。另一方面，佩妮过去在阿尔伯克基很受欢迎。她一路从狂野天堂的女招待，到脱衣舞女，再到妓女。威廉在那里遇见并包养了她。我不确定你能认为这是一种进步。威廉不让他的女人经常出门，他们说他对她管的很严。我认为他很聪明，一个女人可以在一瞬间挥霍掉一大笔财产。}

The tribals hunt geckos, and nobody can get the skin off like they can. I'd give you a good price for skins of such quality, say, 100 for silver and 200 for golden skin. And I don't care where nor how you get them.}
{1704}{}{说到交易...据说你一直在拜访当地部落。我不是在评判你-那是你的事。我感兴趣的是蜥蜴皮。部落猎杀壁虎，没有人能像他们那样把蜥蜴的皮剥下来。我会给你一个很好的价格，比如说，银皮100，金皮200。我不在乎你从哪里得到它们，也不在乎你是如何得到它们。}
#{1750}{}{Golden or silver gecko skins?}
{1750}{}{金色还是银色的蜥蜴皮？}
#{1751}{}{Silver.}
{1751}{}{银色。}
#{1752}{}{Golden.}
{1752}{}{金色。}
#{1753}{}{I want to trade something else right now.}
{1753}{}{我现在想换点别的东西。}
#{1754}{}{You know what? Maybe later.}
{1754}{}{你知道吗？也许以后吧。}
#{1800}{}{Alright. [He takes all your silver gecko skins and gives you }
{1800}{}{好吧。[他拿走你所有的银蜥蜴皮}
#{1801}{}{Excellent. [He takes all your golden gecko skins and gives you }
{1801}{}{好极了。[他拿走了你所有的金蜥蜴皮}
#{1802}{}{ caps.] I'd be interested in buying more, if you manage to get them.}
{1802}{}{ 瓶盖。]如果你能多弄到一些，我想再买点。}
#{1803}{}{I want to sell some silver gecko skins too.}
{1803}{}{我想卖些银蜥蜴皮。}
#{1804}{}{I want to sell some golden gecko skins too.}
{1804}{}{我想卖些金蜥蜴皮。}
#{1805}{}{I want to trade something else right now.}
{1805}{}{我现在想换点别的东西。}
#{1806}{}{We'll see. Bye for now...}
{1806}{}{我们拭目以待。再见...}
#{1850}{}{Welcome to Alvarez's, Hunter. That's me, and I'm sure you know that I fully support your cause with a hefty discount for each of you.}
{1850}{}{欢迎来到阿尔瓦雷斯，猎人。那是我，我相信你们知道我完全支持你们的事业，给你们每人一个大折扣。}
#{1851}{}{Excellent, let's trade then.}
{1851}{}{太好了，那就交易吧。}
#{1852}{}{I have some questions about the city.}
{1852}{}{我有一些关于这个城市的问题。}
#{1853}{}{I don't want to trade, bye.}
{1853}{}{我不想交易，再见。}
#{1854}{}{He?}
{1854}{}{他？}
#{1855}{}{Uf.}
{1855}{}{呃。}
#{1900}{}{It was an honor trading with you, Hunter. Please come again.}
{1900}{}{很荣幸和你交易，猎人。欢迎再来。}
#{1901}{}{I have some questions about the city.}
{1901}{}{我有一些关于这个城市的问题。}
#{1902}{}{Goodbye.}
{1902}{}{再见。}
#{1950}{}{A simple trader like me cannot possible know more then you do. Had I heard about any mutants trying to hide in the Suburbs, I would've reported them of course.}
{1950}{}{像我这样简单交易者不可能比你知道得更多。如果我听说有变种人想躲在郊区，我当然会举报他们。}
#{1951}{}{[Menacingly.] Are you ABSOLUTELY certain?}
{1951}{}{[威胁地。]你“确定”吗？}
#{1952}{}{Do you know about any work here in the city? I want to make some extra caps on the side.}
{1952}{}{你知道城里有什么工作吗？我想在附近多挣点钱。}
#{1953}{}{OK.}
{1953}{}{OK。}
#{2000}{}{I really don't know about any mutants. But you know how it is with the tribals. I have no doubt you'd find some mutation among them if you looked carefully enough.}
{2000}{}{我真的不知道有什么变种人。但你知道部落是怎么回事。如果你仔细观察的话，我毫不怀疑你会在他们中间发现一些变异。}
#{2001}{}{OK.}
{2001}{}{OK。}
#{2050}{}{I really don't know about any mutants, though it might be a good idea to take a look at Ben. He's been meeting with the tribals, and you know how it is with them and mutation.}
{2050}{}{我真的不知道有什么变种人，不过看看本可能是个好主意。他一直在和部落会面，他可能知道他们的情况。}
#{2051}{}{OK.}
{2051}{}{OK。}
#{2100}{}{I really don't know about any mutants. But, since you asked, a woman named Catherine has a small daughter that she never lets out of the house. Very suspicious.}
{2100}{}{我真的不知道有什么变种人。但是，说起来，一个叫凯瑟琳的女人有一个小女儿，她从不让她走出家门，非常可疑。}
#{2101}{}{OK.}
{2101}{}{OK。}
#{2150}{}{Ehh... you're in luck - William has mentioned that I should send anyone that asks for a job to him. No idea what the jobs involves, though.}
{2150}{}{呃...你真走运-威廉说过我应该把任何找工作的人都派给他。不过，不知道这些工作涉及到什么。}
#{2152}{}{Know about any other work?}
{2152}{}{还有其它工作吗？}
#{2151}{}{Alright, thanks.}
{2151}{}{好的，谢谢。}
#{2200}{}{Siento, I don't. As you might suspect, work is pretty scarce in the Suburbs.}
{2200}{}{我不知道。就像你想的那样，郊区的工作非常少。}
#{2201}{}{Goodbye then.}
{2201}{}{那么再见了。}
#{2250}{}{Welcome, I'm glad to see you again - as I'm glad to see every Hunter. My shop is always open, so don't miss any good deals.}
{2250}{}{欢迎，我很高兴再次见到你-就像我很高兴见到每个猎人一样。我的商店一直营业，所以不要错过任何优惠。}
#{2251}{}{Let's trade.}
{2251}{}{我们交易吧。}
#{2252}{}{I have some questions about the city.}
{2252}{}{我有一些关于这个城市的问题。}
#{2253}{}{[Leave.]}
{2253}{}{[离开。]}
#{2254}{}{He?}
{2254}{}{他？}
#{2255}{}{Uf.}
{2255}{}{呃。}
#{2300}{}{Another tribal. [He quietly sighs to himself.] Alright, look, people like you gather over there, where the tents are. [He signs a roof with his hands.] If you want to buy something, I'm sure we can agree on a fair price, just take a look.}
{2300}{}{另一个部落。[他轻轻地叹了口气。]好吧，听着，像你这样的人聚集在那里，帐篷在那里。[他用手在地图上做了标记。]如果你想买东西，我相信我们可以商定一个公平的价格，你看一下就行了。}
#{2301}{}{Another tribal. [He quietly sighs to himself.] Alright, look, people like you gather over there, where the tents are. [He signs a roof with his hands.] If you want to buy something, I'm sure we can agree on a fair price, just take a look.}
{2301}{}{另一个部落。[他轻轻地叹了口气。]好吧，听着，像你这样的人聚集在那里，帐篷在那里。[他用手在地图上做了标记。]如果你想买东西，我相信我们可以商定一个公平的价格，你看一下就行了。}
#{2302}{}{Hee.}
{2302}{}{嘿。}
#{2303}{}{Bai.}
{2303}{}{白。}
#{2350}{}{See, I have many nice things. Come back when you have many caps.}
{2350}{}{看，我有很多好东西。当你有很多瓶盖的时候再来。}
#{2351}{}{Baaai.}
{2351}{}{额呃。}
#{2400}{}{Certainly, my simple-minded friend. We can trade if you want to. I give special prices to people like you.}
{2400}{}{当然，我头脑简单的朋友。如果你愿意，我们可以交易。我给像你这样的人特别的价格。}
#{2401}{}{Certainly, my simple-minded friend. We can trade if you want to. I give special prices to people like you.}
{2401}{}{当然，我头脑简单的朋友。如果你愿意，我们可以交易。我给像你这样的人特别的价格。}
#{2402}{}{Woo!}
{2402}{}{喔！}
#{2403}{}{[Wave your hand and leave.]}
{2403}{}{[挥手离开。]}
#{2450}{}{Dammit, don't you know Hunters hate mutants?! And you come here with a monster, one big walking mutation! Go away, leave, I don't want any trouble.}
{2450}{}{该死的，你不知道猎人讨厌变种人吗？！你居然带着一个变种怪物来到这！快走开，我不想惹麻烦。}
#{2451}{}{Grrr!}
{2451}{}{咯喇！}
#{2452}{}{Blech.}
{2452}{}{唔拉。}
#{2453}{}{OK.}
{2453}{}{OK。}
#{2500}{}{Visit the chief of the tribals - if you don't mind dealing with their kind. I trade with them occasionally, and I know that some of their gecko hunters have gone missing. I'd say the dangers of the wasteland got them, but they think something else is behind it. Bah... They probably blame evil spirits or something.}
{2500}{}{如果你不介意和他们打交道的话，去拜访部落首领吧。我偶尔和他们交易，我知道他们的一些蜥蜴猎人失踪了。我想说是荒地的危险让他们受到了伤害，但他们认为背后还有别的原因。呸... 他们可能会怪恶魔什么的。}
#{2501}{}{Know about any other work?}
{2501}{}{还有其它工作吗？}
#{2502}{}{Tell me about the tribals.}
{2502}{}{告诉我关于部落的事。}
#{2503}{}{OK, but I have some other questions.}
{2503}{}{好的，但我还有一些问题。}
#{2504}{}{Alright, thanks.}
{2504}{}{好的，谢谢。}
#{2550}{}{You might try your luck in the hospital - you'll find it in the Dead Quarter. I doubt they'd take you on as a doctor, but the mercenaries that work for the hospital might still be looking for a few people.}
{2550}{}{你可以在医院碰碰运气-你会在死区找到它的。我怀疑他们会接受你当医生，但为医院工作的雇佣兵可能还在招几个人。}
#{2551}{}{Know about any other work?}
{2551}{}{还有其它工作吗？}
#{2552}{}{OK, but I had some other questions first.}
{2552}{}{好的，但我首先有一些其它的问题。}
#{2553}{}{Alright, thanks.}
{2553}{}{好的，谢谢。}
#{2570}{}{Hard to say. You could try asking Catherine. Every time I see her, I can see on her that something is troubling her. Maybe it's something you could help with. She lives in the house next door. But even if she does talk to you, don't expect much of a profit - she can't afford it.}
{2570}{}{很难说。你可以试着问下凯瑟琳。每次我见到她，我都能从她身上看出有什么事困扰着她。也许你能帮上忙。她住在隔壁的房子里。但即使她真的和你说话，也不要指望有多大的利润 - 她负担不起。}
#{2571}{}{Know about any other work?}
{2571}{}{还有其它工作吗？}
#{2572}{}{OK, but I had some other questions first.}
{2572}{}{好的，但我首先有一些其它的问题。}
#{2573}{}{Alright, thanks.}
{2573}{}{好的，谢谢。}
#{2600}{}{You should try the hospital in the Dead Quarter. The mercenaries working for the hospital might be happy to have a Mutant Hunter join them.}
{2600}{}{你应该去死区的医院看看。为医院工作的雇佣兵可能会很高兴有一个变种猎人加入他们。}
#{2601}{}{Know about any other work?}
{2601}{}{还有其他工作吗？}
#{2602}{}{Alright, thanks.}
{2602}{}{好的，谢谢。}
#{2650}{}{Ehm... Are you feeling well, Hunter? My apologies, I meant nothing by it. We can trade, if you want to.}
{2650}{}{嗯...你感觉好吗，猎人？抱歉，我没有别的意思。如果你愿意，我们可以交易。}
#{2651}{}{Yup.}
{2651}{}{是的。}
#{2652}{}{Noes. Bai.}
{2652}{}{没有。白。}
#{2700}{}{Come back again anytime, Hunter.}
{2700}{}{欢迎再来，猎人。}
#{2701}{}{Baaai.}
{2701}{}{巴艾。}
