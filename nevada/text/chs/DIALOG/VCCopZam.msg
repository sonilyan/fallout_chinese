#{100}{}{You see a policeman.}
{100}{}{你看见一个警察。}
#{101}{}{You see a policeman receptionist behind the desk.}
{101}{}{你看见桌子后面有个警察接待员。}
#{102}{}{False evidence have been placed in Dead hotel, waiting for its time.}
{102}{}{假证已被放置在死亡酒店，等待它的时间。}
#{110}{}{Who are you searching for?}
{110}{}{你在找谁？}
#{111}{}{Goodbye.}
{111}{}{再见。}
#{112}{}{Regarding the case of Sam Phillips.}
{112}{}{关于山姆・菲利普斯的案子。}
#{113}{}{[The policeman suddenly sparkles with interest] This is the toughest subject... So what did you want to tell about Sam Phillips?}
{113}{}{[警察突然兴致勃勃]这是最棘手的问题。。。那你想告诉山姆・菲利普斯什么？}
#{114}{}{I have a substance, that proves his involvement with drugs in the city! He buys this from a caravan from Salt Lake.}
{114}{}{我有一种物质，可以证明他和城里的毒品有关！他从盐湖城的商队买的。}
#{115}{}{I have a substance, that proves his innocence regarding his involvement with drugs in the city! Seems like someone mistook this food supplement for a drug.}
{115}{}{我有一种物质，证明他在城市里涉毒是清白的！好像有人把这种食物补充剂误认为是毒品。}
#{116}{}{I just wanted to ask - how the case is going?}
{116}{}{我只是想问-案子进展如何？}
#{117}{}{Hmm, nothing, I suppose. Just asking.}
{117}{}{嗯，我想没什么。只是问问而已。}
#{118}{}{So that17s what it is! Then I'll simply put handcuffs on you and put you in a cell, so you think next time before wasting police officer's time.}
{118}{}{所以就是这样！然后我就给你戴上手铐，把你关进牢房，这样你下次就不会浪费警官的时间了。}
#{119}{}{Oh no, not in a cell! I'd better walk away quietly.}
{119}{}{哦，不，不是在牢房里！我最好安静地走开。}
#{120}{}{Can I know why are interested in this case?}
{120}{}{我能知道你为什么对这个案子感兴趣吗？}
#{121}{}{Sam Phillips... Er... Owes me money, and I17m worried.}
{121}{}{山姆・菲利普斯。。。呃。。。欠我钱，我很担心。}
#{122}{}{Sam Phillips is my friend and I don17t want, him to go in prison!}
{122}{}{山姆・菲利普斯是我的朋友，我不想让他进监狱！}
#{123}{}{I17m investigating the crime with order of the mayor himself.}
{123}{}{我正在根据市长本人的命令调查这起犯罪。}
#{124}{}{No reason. Why?}
{124}{}{没有理由。为什么？}
#{125}{}{Your boss has given me a civil job to snitch Phillips.}
{125}{}{你老板让我去告密菲利普斯。}
#{126}{}{Oh, then this changes things. At first we have been contacted by anonymous individual and notified, that Phillips makes drugs in his cafe. We went at the site, and found there some of that yellow stinky crap. Our specialists still try to figure out what is it. But they are still struggling, so if they can17t identify this substance, then I don17t know, how all this is going to end.}
{126}{}{哦，这就改变了。起初，匿名人士联系了我们，并通知我们，菲利普斯在他的咖啡馆里制造毒品。我们去了现场，发现了一些黄色的臭东西。我们的专家仍在努力找出原因。但他们仍在挣扎，所以如果他们不能确定这种物质，那么我不知道，这一切将如何结束。}
#{127}{}{Yellow substance? Like this? [show an emulsifier]}
{127}{}{黄色物质？这样地？[展示乳化剂]}
#{128}{}{Hmm. Okay.}
{128}{}{嗯。好吧。}
#{129}{}{Then you'll have to hurry, because during the search in the cafe we found dubious yellow substance resembling components for the production of drugs. Most likely, he will be sent to prison.}
{129}{}{那你就得快点了，因为在咖啡馆的搜查过程中，我们发现了可疑的黄色物质，类似于毒品生产的成分。很可能，他会被送进监狱。}
#{130}{}{Oh shit, is it really that bad?}
{130}{}{哦，妈的，真的有那么糟吗？}
#{131}{}{Oh so it17s your friend! Well then, guys, you'll have to say goodbye to each other. Because soon Sam Phillips will be behind bars in prison. End of story.}
{131}{}{哦，原来是你的朋友！好吧，伙计们，你们得互相道别了。因为很快山姆・菲利普斯就要坐牢了。故事结束了。}
#{132}{}{Damn it, is it really that bad?}
{132}{}{该死，真的有那么糟吗？}
#{133}{}{Drugs?! I don17t believe it! You17re lying!}
{133}{}{药物？！我不相信！你在撒谎！}
#{134}{}{[Looks at you from head to bottom] Independent detective? How interesting. Well, here's how it is. We have been contacted by an anonymous individual, he said, that Sam Phillips makes drugs. We went to the cafe, searched it and found some of that yellow stinky crap there. We're not sure yet what it is, but most likely his guilt will be proved by that thing alone.}
{134}{}{独立侦探？真有趣。好吧，事情是这样的。他说，一位匿名人士与我们联系，说山姆・菲利普斯制造毒品。我们去咖啡馆，搜了一番，发现了一些黄色的臭东西。我们还不确定这是什么，但很有可能他的罪行将证明这件事本身。}
#{135}{}{Now I see. Thanks.}
{135}{}{现在我明白了。谢谢。}
#{136}{}{Yes. It is exactly the same thing we found at Phillips cafe! Where did you get that?}
{136}{}{对。这和我们在菲利普斯咖啡馆发现的一模一样！你从哪儿弄来的？}
#{137}{}{From Bob. He is a caravan merchant from Salt Lake, from whom Sam buys this stuff.}
{137}{}{来自鲍勃。他是一个来自盐湖城的商队商人，萨姆从他那里买了这些东西。}
#{138}{}{How interesting. This means, this drug is being brought from Salt lake?}
{138}{}{真有趣。也就是说，这种药是从盐湖运来的？}
#{139}{}{It17s not a drug! This is a harmless food supplement for pizza. That is all.}
{139}{}{这不是毒品！这是一种对比萨饼无害的食物补充。仅此而已。}
#{140}{}{Yes! And you should as soon as possible to eliminate these supplies, so others would not be hurt!}
{140}{}{对！而且你应该尽快消除这些物资，这样别人就不会受到伤害了！}
#{141}{}{How interesting. So what is this drug?}
{141}{}{真有趣。这是什么药？}
#{142}{}{Wow... Food supplement... It doesn17t look like it. But... How would I know how food supplement looks like? So that17s why our specialists can17t figure this stuff out. Well, I think your expertise is enough to prove Sam Phillips innocence.}
{142}{}{真 的。。。食物补充。。。看起来不像。但是。。。我怎么知道食物补充剂是什么样子的？所以，这就是为什么我们的专家不能弄清楚这些东西。我认为你的专业知识足以证明山姆・菲利普斯是无辜的。}
#{143}{}{That17s great! I17ll go tell him.}
{143}{}{那太好了！我去告诉他。}
#{144}{}{You, of course, are right, and we will do that immediately. Phillips will be arrested, and you, as it is being done in such cases, will be rewarded. Here, 1000$. Thank you, civilian, for your cooperation. I hope you will continue to notify us about any crimes that may be present.}
{144}{}{当然，你是对的，我们会马上这么做。菲利普斯将被逮捕，而你，正如在这种情况下所做的那样，将得到奖励。给，1000美元。谢谢你，平民，谢谢你的合作。我希望你能继续通知我们可能发生的任何犯罪。}
#{145}{}{Heh, easy money.}
{145}{}{嘿，容易赚钱。}
#{150}{}{How is the duty, friend? Anything interesting happened lately?}
{150}{}{你的职责是什么，朋友？最近有什么有趣的事吗？}
#{151}{}{With the wit like yours, I have nothing to do here. But watch yourself. Because you may end up like the other one before you, which we tied to the pillar of shame for everyone to see. Try to not taking his place, with your insolent questions.}
{151}{}{有你这样的才智，我在这里没什么可做的。但你要小心。因为你可能会像你前面的另一个一样，被我们绑在耻辱的柱子上，让大家看到。别用你无礼的问题取代他的位置。}
#{152}{}{Who are you talking about?}
{152}{}{你在说谁？}
#{153}{}{Wow, sorry, to bother you, mister officer! My respects, mister officer! I'm bowing and ready to kiss your hands, mister officer!}
{153}{}{哇，对不起，打扰你了，警官先生！尊敬的警官先生！我鞠躬准备亲吻你的手，警官先生！}
#{154}{}{This idiot calls himself Shitposter. Underage asshole with high self-esteem. He is now hanging under the sun around welcoming console. Go have a look. It's quite a show!}
{154}{}{这个白痴称自己为混蛋。自尊心很强的未成年混蛋。他现在被太阳晒得到处都是。去看看。这真是场秀！}
#{155}{}{Fine.}
{155}{}{好的。}
#{160}{}{I17m looking for jay Kukish, a biker. Heard anything about him?}
{160}{}{我在找杰伊・库基什，一个摩托车手。听说过他吗？}
#{161}{}{Wow - what a coincidence. We are also looking for it! We have orders to detain the offender. If you meet him - remember, he is very dangerous. Do not play around - shoot first, ask questions later.}
{161}{}{哇-太巧了。我们也在寻找它！我们接到了拘留罪犯的命令。如果你遇到他-记住，他很危险。不要到处玩-先开枪，然后再问问题。}
#{162}{}{Uh, thanks for the info.}
{162}{}{呃，谢谢你的消息。}
#{163}{}{Very well. It was a correct decision.}
{163}{}{很好。这是一个正确的决定。}
#{170}{}{I demand to release Murphy from the isolator.}
{170}{}{我要求把墨菲从隔离装置中释放出来。}
#{171}{}{This possibility is allowed in two cases: either you will prove his innocence, or pay a deposit of 500$.}
{171}{}{这种可能性在两种情况下是允许的：要么你证明他的清白，要么付500美元定金。}
#{172}{}{I will pay. Here's the money.}
{172}{}{我会付钱的。这是钱。}
#{173}{}{No use talking to you. See you.}
{173}{}{跟你说话没用。再见。}
#{174}{}{Prisoner Murphy! You're free to go.}
{174}{}{囚犯墨菲！你可以走了。}
#{175}{}{Thank you.}
{175}{}{非常感谢。}
#{176}{}{The money is more important than your health? And if you get infected?}
{176}{}{钱比你的健康更重要？如果你被感染了呢？}
#{177}{}{Ha-ha-ha, you don17t say? This trick is a hundred years old. I've heard everything: "Wasteland disease", "shakes", "Narg syndrome"... What did you come up with this time?}
{177}{}{哈哈哈，你不说？这个把戏有一百年的历史了。我什么都听过：“荒地病”、“颤抖”、“纳格综合症”。。。这次你想到了什么？}
#{178}{}{You17re telling me that, the "Wasteland disease" is not real? I'm a doctor with many years of experience, we have seen the whole villages die from that. Just like in Tonopah or Mesquite. Have you ever been there?}
{178}{}{你是说“荒地病”不是真的吗？我是一个有多年经验的医生，我们亲眼目睹了整个村庄的死亡。就像在托诺帕或梅斯奎特一样。你去过那里吗？}
#{179}{}{Hmm. I heard something about Tonopah. Something about mad people, consuming their own flesh... Or it was really the whole village, which just died out there... But since you're a doctor, I have to believe you. First, write a receipt that you vouch for their diagnosis.}
{179}{}{嗯。我听说了一些关于托诺帕的事。关于疯子，吃自己的肉。。。或者是整个村子都死了。。。但既然你是医生，我就得相信你。首先，写一张收据证明他们的诊断。}
#{180}{}{Is there any work here for a private detective?}
{180}{}{这里有私人侦探的工作吗？}
#{181}{}{Usually we don17t hire anyone and deal by ourselves. But there is a few cases, where your help could be appreciated.}
{181}{}{通常我们不雇人，自己做生意。但在有些情况下，你的帮助是值得感激的。}
#{182}{}{Interesting. What is it?}
{182}{}{很有趣。这是怎么一回事？}
#{183}{}{First, the daughter of the mayor's office archivist went missing. We haven17t been able to find her. You can ask the archivist himself about his daughter. He is located on the second floor of City Hall.}
{183}{}{首先，市长办公室档案管理员的女儿失踪了。我们一直没能找到她。你可以问问档案管理员自己关于他女儿的事。他在市政厅的二楼。}
#{184}{}{Okay. And what17s the other one?}
{184}{}{可以。另一个是什么？}
#{185}{}{There is an experienced pickpocket in Clean City. We received five applications for petty theft. That rascal needs to be caught as soon as possible. Be observant, you may be able to catch him in the act.}
{185}{}{清洁城市里有一个经验丰富的扒手。我们收到了五份小偷小摸的申请。那个流氓需要尽快被抓住。注意观察，你也许能当场抓住他。}
#{186}{}{Okay. The daughter of an archivist and a thief. I'll see what I can do.}
{186}{}{可以。档案管理员和小偷的女儿。我看看我能做什么。}
#{190}{}{What can you say about Anna Clark's disappearance?}
{190}{}{关于安娜・克拉克的失踪你能说些什么？}
#{191}{}{Daughter disappeared without a trace. In the "Hard Rock" no one has seen her, in "Monte" she didn't appear for a long time, and there is no more places to search for girls like her. We gave up on the matter, because of absence of any clues.}
{191}{}{女儿消失得无影无踪。在《硬岩》里没人见过她，在《蒙特》里她很久没出现了，再也找不到像她这样的女孩了。由于没有任何线索，我们放弃了这件事。}
#{192}{}{Okay.}
{192}{}{可以。}
#{205}{}{Regarding freaks.}
{205}{}{关于怪胎。}
#{206}{}{I've got proof of their innocence. They have been framed!}

#{208}{}{What's the problem with them at the police?}
{208}{}{他们在警察局有什么问题？}
#{209}{}{Ah, the old sore problem.}
{209}{}{啊，老毛病。}
#{210}{}{They produce drugs and distribute them around the city. The mayor is against that, and therefore seeks to suppress such scum, so they learn to respect the law.}
{210}{}{他们生产毒品并在城市里分发。市长是反对的，因此试图镇压这种人渣，所以他们要学会尊重法律。}
#{211}{}{I see. Another question.}
{211}{}{我懂了。另一个问题。}
#{212}{}{What are you saying, freaks' favorite? How doubtful. Well, let's see what you got there...}
{212}{}{你在说什么，怪物的最爱？多可疑啊。好吧，让我们看看你有什么。。。}
#{213}{}{Here, I secretly picked up this pamphlet from the slavers. Direct evidence.}
{213}{}{在这里，我偷偷地从奴隶主那里捡到了这本小册子。直接证据。}
#{214}{}{Oh! How unexpected. I don17t know, what the slavers wanted, but we will deal with them. I17ll give the evidence to the chief. Thank you, citizen. In such cases one must be rewarded. Here, take it. [gives 1000$]}
{214}{}{哦！真出乎意料。我不知道奴隶主想要什么，但我们会对付他们的。我要把证据交给局长。谢谢你，市民。在这种情况下，一个人必须得到奖励。来，拿着。[给出1000美元]}
#{215}{}{One thousand bucks!}
{215}{}{一千块！}
#{216}{}{Very cunning of you. Good job! Underworld must be punished... And you should be rewarded. [Gives you $ 2000] As for those freaks - do not worry. We now arrange to round them up and they won17t do any harm to anyone from now on.}
{216}{}{你真狡猾。干得好！黑社会必须受到惩罚。。。你应该得到奖励。[给你2000美元]至于那些怪胎-别担心。我们现在安排把他们围捕起来，从现在起他们不会伤害任何人。}
#{217}{}{I want to participate! I17m sick of my gun collecting dust from idleness.}
{217}{}{我想参加！我讨厌我的枪因懒惰而积灰。}
#{218}{}{Great!}
{218}{}{太好了！}
#{219}{}{Additional gun won17t hurt.  I think the freaks' expulsion will be easy.}
{219}{}{再加一把枪也不会伤着你。我认为怪胎的驱逐会很容易。}
#{220}{}{[You are waiting, while the police squad gets ready for a punitive operation to the Dead Hotel]}
{220}{}{[你在等，而警察小组正准备对死亡酒店进行惩罚行动]}
#{221}{}{I visited the freaks' hotel. They've got dope laying even in boxes! You should immediately check this!}
{221}{}{我去了怪物旅馆。他们甚至把毒品放在箱子里！你应该马上检查这个！}
#{222}{}{You are just in time. Thank you for the information, on behalf of the Las Vegas police. You are entitled to a reward. Here's 1,000$. As for the freaks - you can rest assured. We are now getting ready to go on a punitive operation.}

#{225}{}{This is a record of our conversation. He persuaded me to illegally snitch the freaks!}
{225}{}{这是我们谈话的记录。他说服我非法告密那些怪胎！}
#{226}{}{This is a record of our conversation. He hired me, to steal Bob Neil's gun!}
{226}{}{这是我们谈话的记录。他雇我来偷鲍勃・尼尔的枪！}
#{227}{}{If everything is so serious, perhaps, I should refuse to present further evidence.}
{227}{}{如果一切都这么严重，也许，我应该拒绝提出进一步的证据。}
#{228}{}{I do not think that someone in the police will seriously blame Mr. Wallace in such actions. Quite the contrary. But I must give evidence to our boss. Thank you, citizen. You're now free to go.}
{228}{}{我不认为警方会有人在这种行为中责怪华莱士先生。恰恰相反。但我必须向我们的老板提供证据。谢谢你，市民。你现在可以走了。}
#{229}{}{Can my incognito be guaranteed?}
{229}{}{我的隐姓埋名能得到保证吗？}
#{230}{}{Okay.}
{230}{}{可以。}
#{231}{}{Yes, of course.}
{231}{}{是的，当然。}
#{232}{}{Yes, it is a serious offense. Unfortunately, I cannot take any early action. I will give the evidence to our boss, and he will have to make a final decision. Thank you, citizen, for your assistance. We will take it from here.}
{232}{}{是的，这是严重的冒犯。不幸的是，我不能采取任何早期行动。我会把证据交给我们的老板，他必须做出最后的决定。市民，谢谢您的帮助。我们从这里开始。}
#{233}{}{Don17t I deserve some sort of a reward?}
{233}{}{我不应该得到某种奖励吗？}
#{234}{}{What do you think, why Wallace needed the pistol?}
{234}{}{你觉得华莱士为什么需要手枪？}
#{235}{}{I hope, your chief will figure it out.}
{235}{}{我希望你的头儿能弄明白。}
#{236}{}{No.}
{236}{}{不。}
#{237}{}{WHAT?! I risked my life and all was in vain! Fucking cop! Shove that evidence up your ass!}
{237}{}{什么？！我冒着生命危险，一切都白费了！他妈的警察！把证据塞进你的屁股！}
#{238}{}{Shame.}
{238}{}{羞愧。}
#{239}{}{I cannot say for sure. Perhaps he wanted set up Bob Neil and send him to prison. But why would he need that - I cannot understand.}
{239}{}{我不能肯定。也许他想陷害鲍勃・尼尔，把他送进监狱。但他为什么需要这个-我不明白。}
#{240}{}{Right.}
{240}{}{正确的。}
#{241}{}{About the drugs that flood Vegas.}
{241}{}{关于充斥维加斯的毒品。}

#{246}{}{Good, smartass. And I was glad that the new clues emerged. We are still working on the case, but there's no end of it.}

#{247}{}{Bad police work, officer!}
{247}{}{警察干得不好，警官！}
#{248}{}{Too bad.}
{248}{}{太糟糕了。}

{250}{}{现在这是一种奖励！哦，是的！}
#{251}{}{Now we got 'em! The Black Caravan will soon be of the color of ashes. Ha! Who would have thought, that in our times there is such honorable people left, like you. Here, take this reward. The whole Las Vegas is thankful to you. I hope you will continue to inform us about such criminal individuals.}
{251}{}{现在我们抓住他们了！黑色的大篷车很快就会变成灰烬的颜色。哈！谁会想到，在我们这个时代，还有像你这样可敬的人。来，拿着这个奖励。整个拉斯维加斯都感谢你。我希望你能继续告诉我们这些罪犯的情况。}

{255}{}{是的，但是对于这样一个极其重要的案件，我想再多谈一点。}
#{256}{}{I am not authorized to deal with such issues. Refer to the police chief, Oscar Davis, he is in his office.}
{256}{}{我无权处理这些问题。告诉警察局长奥斯卡・戴维斯，他在办公室。}
#{257}{}{Okay.}
{257}{}{可以。}
#{258}{}{We rarely get help in such difficult matters... I think we could reward you, but what do you want?}

#{287}{}{I knew it, that Kings will get involved. Fucking bastards! But you... Wait, you said that you17re just a mercenary. Listen, I can let you go. But you'll have to do something to redeem yourself - kill Orris. That will be fair. If you won17t do that, then you will get a bullet in your head as soon as you show yourself in Clean City. Got it? Now get the fuck out of here, before I change my mind!}
{287}{}{我就知道，国王会介入的。他妈的混蛋！但是你。。。等等，你说你只是个雇佣兵。听着，我可以放你走。但你得做点什么来救赎自己-杀了奥里斯。那是公平的。如果你不这样做，那么一旦你在干净的城市里露面，你的脑袋就会中弹。知道了？在我改变主意之前，他妈的滚出去！}

#{291}{}{Very unpleasant story. City Hall employees are usually the standard of a respectable citizen. I hope you understand that this should stay private. The matter is not only in Irvine's crime, but also in the general situation. His example may be followed by others, not to mention the reputation of a Clean City. As for Murphy, we'll have to let him go. Although, I think it will bite us in the ass later.}
{291}{}{很不愉快的故事。市政厅的员工通常是受人尊敬的公民的标准。我希望你能理解这件事应该保密。这件事不仅发生在欧文的罪行中，而且也发生在一般情况中。他的榜样可能会被其他人效仿，更不用说清洁城市的声誉了。至于墨菲，我们得放了他。不过，我想它以后会咬我们的屁股。}

{1151}{}{有你这样的才智，我在这里没什么可做的。但你要小心。因为你可能会像你前面的另一个一样，被我们绑在耻辱的柱子上，让大家看到。别用你无礼的问题取代他的位置。}

{1153}{}{哇，对不起，打扰你了，警官先生！尊敬的警官先生！我鞠躬准备亲吻你的手，警官先生！}

{1237}{}{什么？！我冒着生命危险，一切都白费了！他妈的警察！把证据塞进你的屁股！}
