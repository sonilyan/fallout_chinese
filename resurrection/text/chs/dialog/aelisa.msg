#{650}{}{That good-for-nothing sent you? He really does try my patience. The only job he could know about was the one assigned to him. But he's been tarrying for an eternity. He likely hopes to pass it onto someone else this way. But... [She thinks for a moment.] that's not a completely stupid idea. This errand would indeed be more suited to someone without a connection to the empire. [She studies you carefully.] Do you really wish to work for the emperor?}
{650}{}{那个废物派你来的？他真的在考验我的耐心。他唯一知道的工作就是分配给他的工作。但他已经耽搁了很久了。他可能希望通过这种方式把它交给别人。但是…[她想了一会儿。]这也不是一个完全愚蠢的主意。这种差事确实更适合与帝国无关的人。[她仔细地研究你。]你真的想为皇帝工作吗?}

#{1502}{}{I can try. Goodbye, Adviser Elisa.}
{1502}{}{我可以试试。再见，伊莉莎顾问。}
#{1550}{}{Have you spoken to the informant? I'd like to know if all this grief brought some results at least.}
{1550}{}{你和线人谈过了吗？我想知道这些悲伤是否至少带来了一些结果。}
#{1551}{}{Have you spoken to the informant? I'd like to know if all this grief brought some results at least.}
{1551}{}{你和线人谈过了吗？我想知道这些悲伤是否至少带来了一些结果。}
#{1552}{}{Relax. He told me what we needed to know. Anonym's secret hideout is located in a cellar beneath a certain abandoned house in the Dead Quarter. He and his accomplices supposedly regularly meet there in secret. The informant doesn't know the time of their next meeting yet, but as soon as he finds out, he'll contact you directly. I think we can rely on it.}
{1552}{}{放松。他告诉了我我们需要知道的。匿名者的秘密藏身之处位于死区一栋废弃房子下面的地窖里。据说他和他的同伙定期在那里秘密会面。线人还不知道他们下次见面的时间，但一旦他知道了，他会直接联系你。我想我们可以信赖它。}
#{1553}{}{I'll go to him right now. See you later.}
{1553}{}{我现在就去找他。待会儿见。}
#{1554}{}{There's been a bit of an inconvenience. Things got out of hand and... The informant is dead, I killed him. He gave me no choice, really.}
{1554}{}{有一点不方便。事情失去了控制…线人死了，是我杀了他。他让我别无选择，真的。}

{1555}{}{有一点不方便。事情失去了控制…线人死了，是我杀了他。他让我别无选择，真的。}
#{1600}{}{Good work. You can collect your well-earned payment from the supply officer. I'll try to let you know as soon as the informant reports in. I see you have an older model of Pip-Boy. Is it still functional?}
{1600}{}{干得好。你可以从供应官那里领取你应得的报酬。线人一到我就会尽快通知你。我看到你有一款老式的哔哔小子。它还能用吗？}
#{1601}{}{Good work. You can collect your well-earned payment from the supply officer. I'll try to let you know as soon as the informant reports in. I see you have an older model of Pip-Boy. Is it still functional?}

#{1602}{}{As far as I know, yes. Why do you ask?}
{1602}{}{据我所知，是的。你为什么这么问？}
#{1650}{}{Excellent, that will save us a lot of time. I can send a message to it when I know the time of Anonym's next meeting. But first you'll have to connect it to the imperial network. All you need to do is enter the password "Theodor" into any free terminal here in the palace. A Pip-Boy connector will extend from it, so just connect your Pip-Boy and the computer will take care of the rest. The range of our network is limited to a small area around the City, so try to stay nearby. It won't reach you outside Albuquerque.}
{1650}{}{太好了，这会节省我们很多时间。我知道匿名者下次会议的时间后就可以给它发消息。但首先你得把它连接到帝国网络上。你所要做的就是输入密码“Theodor”进入宫殿里的任意一个免费终端。一个哔哔小子连接器将从它延伸出来，所以只需连接你的哔哔小子，计算机将负责其余部分。我们的网络范围仅限于城市周围的一小块区域，所以尽量留在附近。出了阿尔伯克基你就收不到。}
#{1651}{}{Alright, Adviser Elisa. I'll do that.}
{1651}{}{好了，伊莉莎顾问。我会这么做的。}
#{1700}{}{You're finally here. I was starting to get worried my message didn't reach you. A group that will set off for Anonym's base at night needs to be prepared immediately. Because there's a risk that the information could be leaked to our enemies, I couldn't initiate too many people into the plan, but I still managed to put together a small squad of volunteers from the imperial army. However, they won't accomplish a great task like this alone. They will need all the help they can get.}
{1700}{}{你终于来了。我都开始担心你没收到我的信息了。一个将在夜间出发前往匿名者基地的小队需要立即做好准备。因为有信息泄露给敌人的风险，所以我不能让太多人参与这个计划，但我还是设法从帝国军队中组织了一个小队。然而，他们无法独自完成这样一项伟大的任务。他们需要所有能得到的帮助。}
#{1701}{}{You're finally here. I was starting to get worried you'd never come back. I tried to send you a message, but your Pip-Boy still isn't connected to the imperial network.

Because there's a risk that the information could be leaked to our enemies, I couldn't initiate too many people into the plan, but I still managed to put together a small squad of volunteers from the imperial army.

{1701}{}{你终于来了。我都开始担心你再也不会回来了，我试着给你发消息，但你的哔哔小子还是没有连接到帝国网络。我们有机会抓住匿名者。我们差点就开始了。一个将在夜间出发前往匿名者基地的小队需要立即做好准备。因为有信息泄露给敌人的风险，所以我不能让太多人参与这个计划，但我还是设法从帝国军队中组织了一个小队。然而，他们无法独自完成这样一项伟大的任务。他们需要所有能得到的帮助。}
#{1702}{}{I hope we won't fail you and finally capture Anonym.}
{1702}{}{我希望我们不会让你失望，最终抓住匿名者。}
#{1703}{}{Alright. I just hope your people won't get in my way.}
{1703}{}{好吧。我只希望你的人不会妨碍我。}
#{1750}{}{The imperial soldiers with you at your side surely won't. But you must be very careful. Anonym is capable of anything and will certainly try some deceit. You mustn't let him outsmart you.}
{1750}{}{与你并肩作战的帝国士兵当然不会，但你必须非常小心。匿名者无所不能，肯定会尝试一些欺骗。你不能让他比你聪明。}
#{1751}{}{You don't have to worry about that. Anonym's days are numbered. [Wait until midnight and head for his hideout with the soldiers.]}
{1751}{}{你不用担心这个。匿名者的日子屈指可数了。[等到午夜和士兵们一起去他的藏身处。]}
#{1800}{}{[Elisa looks tense.] Speak, quickly. Did you manage to kill the foul traitor?}
{1800}{}{[伊莉莎看起来很紧张。]快说。你杀了那个卑鄙的叛徒了吗？}
#{1801}{}{[Nod.] Anonym is dead. It was Adviser Aran.}
{1801}{}{[点头。] 匿名者死了。是阿朗顾问。}
#{1850}{}{So it's really true then. While you were gone, we found letters in Aran's quarters in which he wrote about his plans to assassinate emperor Myzrael and take his place. A handful of his most loyal followers was to help him with that. I was hoping that they were just fakes that someone planted there. But I have no choice but to believe them now.}
{1850}{}{所以这是真的。你不在的时候，我们在阿朗的住处发现了一些信件，他在信中说他计划刺杀米泽列皇帝并取代他的位置。他的几个最忠实的追随者帮了他。我还希望那只是有人栽赃的赝品。但现在我别无选择，只能相信他们。}

#{1852}{}{What will you do then?}
{1852}{}{那你要做什么？}
#{1853}{}{I don't care about the empire's problems. I want my caps.}
{1853}{}{我不在乎帝国的问题。我要我的瓶盖。}
#{1900}{}{His betrayal must not come out. The people of the empire could not bear such a painful revelation. We must protect them from the slightest suspicion. And we'll start with you. You won't receive your reward publicly to avoid unnecessary turmoil. You'll get it from an officer that will be waiting for you in the Dead Quarter. And after that, try to avoid the empire. It will be for the best.}
{1900}{}{他的背叛不能泄露出去。帝国的人民无法忍受如此痛苦的揭露。我们必须保护他们不受丝毫怀疑。我们从你开始。为了避免不必要的混乱，你不会公开获得奖励。你会从一个在死区等着你的军官那里得到它。在那之后，尽量避开帝国。这是最好的结果。}
#{1901}{}{If you say so, Adviser Elisa. Goodbye.}
{1901}{}{依你所愿，伊莉莎顾问。再见。}
#{1950}{}{Yes, you have certainly earned them. However, you cannot receive them here. Aran's betrayal must not come out - for the good of the empire. Receiving your reward publicly would only bring unnecessary attention. You'll get your pay from an officer that will be waiting for you in the Dead Quarter. And after that, try to avoid the City. It will be for the best.}
{1950}{}{是的，这是你应得的。但是，您不能在这里接收。为了帝国的利益，阿朗的背叛不能被公之于众。公开接受奖励只会带来不必要的关注。你会从一个在死区等你的军官那里拿到报酬。在那之后，尽量避开城市。这是最好的结果。}
#{1951}{}{If you say so, Adviser Elisa. Goodbye.}
{1951}{}{依你所愿，伊莉莎顾问。再见。}
#{2000}{}{[Empress Elisa looks surprised.] I certainly didn't expect you here. Have you already collected your reward?}
{2000}{}{[伊莉莎女王看起来很惊讶。]我真没想到你会在这儿。你已经拿到报酬了吗？}
#{2001}{}{[Empress Elisa looks surprised.] I certainly didn't expect you here. Have you already collected your reward?}
{2001}{}{[伊莉莎女王看起来很惊讶。]我真没想到你会在这儿。你已经拿到报酬了吗？}
#{2002}{}{Stop pretending. I know about everything. Your plan with the mercenaries didn't work. I killed them all, so they won't be doing any of your dirty work anymore.}
{2002}{}{别装了。我什么都知道。你和雇佣兵的计划没有奏效。我把他们都杀了，这样他们就不会再为你做任何肮脏的勾当了。}
#{2003}{}{Stop pretending. I know about everything. Your plan with the mercenaries didn't work. I killed them all, so they won't be doing any of your dirty work anymore.}
{2003}{}{别装了。我什么都知道。你和雇佣兵的计划没有奏效。我把他们都杀了，这样他们就不会再为你做任何肮脏的勾当了。}
#{2004}{}{No, I completely forgot. Thanks for a reminder.}
{2004}{}{不，我完全忘了。谢谢提醒。}
#{2005}{}{Yees! Okies.}
{2005}{}{是啊！好啊啊。}
#{2006}{}{Noes! There bam bam. [Point a finger at her.] Bad!}
{2006}{}{不！砰砰。[用手指着她。]坏！}
#{2050}{}{[She grins.] Who would've thought you'd be of such good service to me. That band of cut-throats was starting to become a nuisance. Had they tried to blackmail me, my position would've been seriously threatened. But now, I don't have to worry about that anymore. As for you, our cooperation is over. Since you are completely powerless compared to me, I can afford to be generous and spare your pathetic life. You should be grateful and never bother me again.}
{2050}{}{[她笑着说。]谁能想到你会对我这么有帮助。那帮杀人如麻的家伙开始惹人讨厌了。如果他们试图敲诈我，我的职位就会受到严重威胁。但现在，我再也不用担心了。至于你，我们的合作结束了。既然你和我相比是完全无能为力的，我可以慷慨地饶了你可怜的生命。你应该心存感激，别再来烦我了。}
#{2051}{}{You'll excuse me for not dancing in joy over your mercy. But have it your way. There's nothing for me here anyway. Goodbye, empress Elisa.}
{2051}{}{请原谅我没有为你的仁慈高兴得手舞足蹈。但要按你的方式去做。反正这里也没什么适合我的。再见，伊莉莎女王。}
#{2052}{}{You won't get rid of me that easily. Remember, one day I will find a way to take my revenge. And that will be the day we meet again.}
{2052}{}{你没那么容易摆脱我。记住，总有一天我会找到复仇的方法。那将是我们重逢的日子。}
#{2053}{}{Enough of this. Time to pay for your sins, you treacherous whore!}
{2053}{}{够了。是时候为你的罪付出代价了，你这个背信弃义的婊子！}
#{2054}{}{ Don't make the same mistake as Lystra, who tried to gather support against me. Poor girl, our soldiers found her body outside the walls. It seems that the ghouls are to blame. She never should have left the empire. The outside world is too dangerous.}
{2054}{}{ 不要犯和莱斯特拉一样的错误，她试图集结力量反对我。可怜的姑娘，我们的士兵在墙外发现了她的尸体。看来僵尸是罪魁祸首。她根本就不该离开帝国。外面的世界太危险了。}
#{2100}{}{[Waiting in a dank, foul-smelling tunnel wasn't exactly pleasant. You seem to be in a part of the pre-war Albuquerque sewer system. Boredom slowly starts to overcome you, when the present silence is interrupted with the sound of approaching footsteps. The mercenaries stop glaring at you and turn their eyes to the approaching person in brown robes. Judging from the respect shown, it must be Anonym. He stands completely still for a moment, then turns to the mercenaries that gathered there. Under the hood, you spot the face of Adviser Elisa.]}
{2100}{}{[在潮湿、恶臭的隧道里等待并不是件愉快的事。你似乎置身于战前阿尔伯克基下水道系统的一部分。无聊慢慢地开始战胜你，此时的沉默被脚步声打断。雇佣兵不再盯着你，而是把目光转向穿着棕色长袍的人。从所表现出的尊重程度来看，这一定是匿名者。他一动不动地站了一会儿，然后转向聚集在那里的雇佣兵。在引擎盖下，你看到了顾问伊莉莎的脸。]}
#{2101}{}{But that's Elisa from the empire! Someone must've blown our cover.}
{2101}{}{但那是帝国的伊莉莎！肯定有人暴露了我们的身份。}
#{2102}{}{I wouldn't have expected that you, of all people, would be fighting for the other side.}
{2102}{}{我没想到在所有人中，你会为另一方而战。}
#{2103}{}{I wouldn't have expected that you, of all people, would be fighting for the other side.}
{2103}{}{我没想到在所有人中，你会为另一方而战。}
#{2104}{}{Nooo. Hoo! [Flail your arms around.] You baaad!}
{2104}{}{不。呼！[挥动你的手臂。] 你这个坏蛋！}
#{2150}{}{[Elisa pays you no attention and begins her speech.] You have all done much work, and even risked your lives for my sake. And you have been properly paid for it. But now, the time has come for the most important task yet. Soon, Aran and his elite squad will enter this place. They were given a tip that they would find Anonym here. But they will find only you, and it is you who must make sure that this place becomes their grave. If you succeed, your reward will be great.}
{2150}{}{[伊莉莎没有关注你，开始她的演讲。]你们都做了很多工作，甚至为了我冒着生命危险。你也因此得到了应得的报酬。但现在，最重要的任务已经到来。很快，阿郎和他的精英小队就会进入这个地方。他们得到消息说能在这里找到匿名者。但他们只会找到你，而你必须确保这个地方成为他们的坟墓。如果你成功了，你的回报将是巨大的。}
#{2151}{}{Now everything is finally starting to make sense...}
{2151}{}{现在一切终于开始有意义了…}
#{2200}{}{[Her speech is over, a few mercenaries whoop enthusiastically. Elisa turns to you.] We've seen each other already. You were very convincing during the council meeting. I'm sure you will succeed in the next task I'm planning to give you as well. When you send Adviser Aran to the next world, you need to take the patch on the right sleeve of his jumpsuit and bring it to me in the palace. From all the mercenaries, you're the only one that's ever been there. Therefore, you are the ideal person for delivering the proof of Aran's death.}
{2200}{}{[她的演讲结束了，几个雇佣兵热情地欢呼起来。伊莉莎转向你。]我们已经见过面了。你在议会上很有说服力。我相信你也会成功完成我计划交给你的下一个任务。当你把阿朗顾问送到另一个世界时，你需要取下他连体衣右袖上的补丁，带到宫殿里给我。在所有的雇佣兵中，你是唯一一个去过那里的。因此，你是传递阿郎死亡证据的最佳人选。}

{2202}{}{理解。我拿到后马上去找你。}
#{2250}{}{[Elisa scowls.] How did this idiot get here? This was supposed to be a top secret meeting. Terminate him immediately!}

{2300}{}{[伊莉莎似乎很激动。]来吧，快说。阿朗死了吗？给我看看他袖子上的补丁。}
#{2301}{}{You can see for yourself. [Show her the scrap of Aran's jumpsuit.]}
{2301}{}{你可以自己看看。[给她看阿朗的连身衣碎片。]}
#{2302}{}{Eh... There's been a slight complication. I'll be right back.}
{2302}{}{呃…有点小麻烦。我马上就回来。}
#{2450}{}{[She smiles.] I owe you my thanks for your services. I would've surely succeeded even without them, but I am grateful to you regardless.

I see you have an older model of Pip-Boy. Is it still functional?}
{2450}{}{[她微笑着说。]我对你的服务表示感谢。即使没有他们，我也一定能成功，但我还是很感激你。你可以从这座大楼入口一侧的街道上供应官那里领取你应得的报酬。如果我再需要你，我会尽量让你知道的。我看到你有一款老式的哔哔小子。它还能用吗？}
#{2451}{}{Of course it is. Why do you ask?}

#{2650}{}{What do you think? I wanted to rule the empire. There's no one more suited to that post than me.

#{2700}{}{*All* I wanted? I don't consider ruling the only civilized society left in the entire area a small thing. And this isn't just about me.

I will not allow anyone to stand in the way of our progress.}
{2700}{}{“全部”是我想要的吗？我不认为统治整个地区仅存的文明社会是件小事。这不是我一个人的事。帝国的潜力取决于统治者的能力。对米泽列来说，它很脆弱。有了那个愚蠢的士兵阿朗，它也不会更强大。我会变得不一样。我不会允许任何人阻挡我们前进的道路。}

{2750}{}{我希望你指的是“我” 的臣民。至于他们，他们都相信官方的报道。关于可怜的米泽列的故事，因为他对心爱的顾问背叛而沮丧到他的心无法承受。人民被帝国的宣传灌输得如此之深，以至于他们几乎会相信任何事情。}

#{2752}{}{Can you also tell me about your plans for the future of the empire?}
{2752}{}{你能告诉我你对帝国未来的计划吗？}
#{2753}{}{Tell me what you're going to do with the Vault.}
{2753}{}{你打算怎么处理避难所。}
#{2754}{}{Thank you for your answer. Goodbye for now, empress Elisa.}
{2754}{}{谢谢你的解答。再见了，伊莉莎女王。}
#{2800}{}{First of all, I must make sure that the empire has any future at all. Myzrael's pathetic rule made it into a degenerate place. That will have to change. I have already disbanded the imperial council, next, I will gradually concentrate all the power in my hands. The renewal would not be possible without that. Only a strong empress can create a powerful empire. I will not stop until I succeed.}
{2800}{}{首先，我必须确保帝国还有未来。米泽列可悲的统治让它变成了堕落的地方。这种情况必须改变。我已经解散了帝国议会，接下来，我将逐步把所有的权力集中在我手中。如果没有这一点，复兴是不可能的。只有强大的女王才能创造强大的帝国。不成功我是不会罢休的。}
#{2801}{}{You sure don't aim low. And what actually led you to creating Anonym?}
{2801}{}{你的目标肯定不低。是什么促使你创建了匿名者？}
#{2802}{}{I was also curious how Myzrael's subjects took his death.}
{2802}{}{我也很好奇米泽列的臣民是如何看待他的死亡的。}
#{2803}{}{Tell me what you're going to do with the Vault.}
{2803}{}{你打算怎么处理避难所。}
#{2804}{}{Thank you for your answer. I won't keep you any longer.}
{2804}{}{谢谢你的解答。我不耽误你时间了。}
#{2850}{}{I find the trustworthiness of such a man to be rather dubious. It is likely he was simply bragging or trying to make a profit off you. Nothing unusual in that backwater world of yours. Still, I will have him investigated. You should concentrate on your task instead and find our soldiers as soon as possible.}
{2850}{}{我觉得这样一个人的可信度相当可疑。很可能他只是在吹牛或是想从你身上获利。在你那个闭塞的世界里没什么不寻常的。不过，我还是会让人调查他。你应该专注于你的任务，尽快找到我们的士兵。}
#{2851}{}{Who is this Aran you spoke of, anyway? Can he be trusted?}
{2851}{}{你说的阿朗是谁？他能被信任吗？}
#{2852}{}{I will go look for them immediately. Goodbye for now, Adviser Elisa.}
{2852}{}{我马上去找他们。再见了，伊莉莎顾问。}
#{2900}{}{There was no such man in the Wild Paradise. He probably managed to disappear in time. Any knowledge of Anonym that he might have had disappeared with him. But you don't have to worry about that. You are supposed to find the lost soldiers. Until then, don't waste your time on other things.}
{2900}{}{在狂野天堂里没有这样的人。他可能及时消失了。任何关于“匿名者”的信息都可能随他一起消失。但你不用担心这个。你应该去找那些失踪的士兵。在那之前，不要把时间浪费在其他事情上。}
#{2901}{}{I've already found them, in a cellar in one of the houses in the Dead Quarter. All of them dead. Someone must've massacred them. It wasn't a pretty sight.}
{2901}{}{我已经找到了，在死区一栋房子的地窖里。他们都死了。一定是有人屠杀了他们。那景象并不好看。}
#{2902}{}{I've already found them, in a cellar in one of the houses in the Dead Quarter. All of them dead. Someone must've massacred them. It wasn't a pretty sight.}

#{2903}{}{Very well, Adviser Elisa.}
{2903}{}{很好，伊莉莎顾问。}
#{2950}{}{[Elisa seems hostile.] You had your task, and, as I have heard, you did not follow my instructions. Your negligence is threatening my plans. I will not tolerate that.}
{2950}{}{[伊莉莎怀有敌意。]你有你的任务，而且，正如我所听说的，你没有听从我的指示。你的疏忽正威胁着我的计划。我不会容忍的。}

{2952}{}{你打算怎么办？}
#{2953}{}{He?}
{2953}{}{哈？}
#{3000}{}{I do not believe I sent for you. What do you want?}
{3000}{}{我不相信是我派人来找你的。你想要什么？}
#{3001}{}{Can I ask you a few questions?}
{3001}{}{我能问你几个问题吗？}
#{3002}{}{Can I ask you a few questions?}
{3002}{}{我能问你几个问题吗？}
#{3003}{}{Nothing at all, empress Elisa. I will leave immediately.}
{3003}{}{没什么，伊莉莎女王。我马上就走。}
#{3004}{}{Huh. Ech.}
{3004}{}{呵呵。呃。}
#{3050}{}{My message has reached you then, good. As you might have heard, the lower floors of the Vault have not been under empire's control for some time. The Mutant Hunters forced us out of them. That's a problem that requires an immediate solution. And that is why I would like to make use of your services once again. Our previous cooperation has been beneficial for both sides. It helped me to the position of an empress, and it helped you to a hefty profit. Why not continue for a time?}
{3050}{}{你收到我的信息了，很好。你可能已经听说了，避难所的下层已经有一段时间不受帝国的控制了。变种猎人把我们赶了出来。这是一个需要立即解决的问题。这就是为什么我想再次使用你的服务。我们过去的合作对双方都是有益的。它帮我登上了女王的位置，也帮你赚了一大笔钱。为什么不继续一段时间呢?}

{3053}{}{这次不行。我还有别的事要操心。}
#{3054}{}{Huh?!}
{3054}{}{呵呵？！}
#{3100}{}{I want the Hunters removed from the Vault. Whatever the cost! If that foolish band of ex-raiders refuses to leave willingly, they will be removed by force. I've put colonel Parson in charge of the operation. You'll find him on the first floor of the Vault. You are the very first foreigner that will be allowed entry into the Vault. You should be grateful for the privilege - don't even think of misusing it. Act quickly. The Vault must be taken back as soon as possible.}
{3100}{}{我要把猎人们赶出避难所。无论付出什么代价！如果那群愚蠢的前入侵者拒绝自愿离开，他们将被武力驱逐。我已经让帕森上校负责这次行动了。你会在避难所的一层找到他。你是第一个被允许进入避难所的外国人。你应该对这种特权心存感激――别想滥用它。赶快行动。必须尽快夺回避难所。}

{3102}{}{还有什么能告诉我的吗？}
#{3150}{}{[Elisa seems somewhat uneasy.] Besides the Hunters, there is also something else on the lower floor of the Vault. We were unable to find out exactly what it is, but it is extremely dangerous. You will find out more here. [She gives you a holodisk.] It's a report from the recon team we sent there. It was them who discovered the Hunters' presence in the Vault. Colonel Parson will tell you the rest.}
{3150}{}{[伊莉莎似乎有些不安。]除了猎人，避难所的下层还有别的东西。我们无法查明它到底是什么，但它非常危险。您将在这里了解更多信息。[她给你一张全息光盘。]这是我们派去的侦察队的报告，正是他们发现在避难所里猎人们的存在。帕森上校会告诉你剩下的的事情。}
#{3151}{}{Alright, I'll go to him. Farewell, empress Elisa.}
{3151}{}{好吧，我去找他。再见，伊莉莎女王。}
#{3200}{}{Removing the Hunters from the Vault is our highest priority right now. You have your instructions. Do not dare to fail me.}
{3200}{}{把猎人从避难所赶出去是我们现在的首要任务。你已经得到指示了。别让我失望。}

#{3353}{}{Huhla.}
{3353}{}{哈拉。}

{3403}{}{嗯嗯。}
#{3450}{}{By reconquering the Vault, I have gained a large amount of valuable technical equipment that I can use for the good of the empire.

#{4050}{}{He was removed. That decrepit old man stood in my way for far too long. As long as he was under Aran's protection, I had no choice but to patiently bear all his weakness and arrogance, but that time is finally over. You cannot imagine how I enjoyed personally ending his life. Watching him slowly die, finally making way for my rule. The feeling was far beyond my expectations. [She stops herself. She probably said more than she intended.] Of course, the official version of Myzrael's passing is a little different. So kindly keep our little secret to yourself.}
{4050}{}{他被免职了。那个衰老的老人挡我的路太久了。只要他还在阿朗的保护下，我就别无选择，只能耐心地忍受他所有的软弱和傲慢，但那个时代终于结束了。你无法想象我有多享受亲手结束他的生命。看着他慢慢死去，最终为我的统治让路。这种感觉远远超出了我的预期。[她停下来。她可能说得太多了。]当然，官方版本的米泽列的去世有点不同。所以请你保守我们的小秘密。}
