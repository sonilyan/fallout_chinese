#Questions
### {220}{}{How did you become a ranger?}
{220}{}{你是如何成为一名护林员的？}
### {221}{}{Learning from an early age and a lot of practice in the desert. Serve with me - and also, perhaps, you will become a field commander.}
{221}{}{从小学习，在沙漠中进行了大量练习。和我一起服役――也许，你也会成为一名战地指挥官。}
### {222}{}{What is this place?}
{222}{}{这是什么地方？}
### {223}{}{This is the main base of the Rangers. The command center is located inside the power plant, here we train and meet "guests".}
{223}{}{这是游骑兵队的主要基地。指挥中心位于发电厂内，我们在这里训练和迎接“客人”。}
### {224}{}{Which "guests" are we talking about?}
{224}{}{我们在谈论哪些“客人”？}
### {225}{}{Merchants and representatives for negotiations. If you don't know yet, we are engaged in restoring order in this region. And that requires allies.}
{225}{}{商人和谈判代表。如果你还不知道，我们正在恢复该地区的秩序。这需要盟友。}
### {226}{}{I don't know much about Rangers. Tell us more?}
{226}{}{我对流浪者队了解不多。告诉我们更多？}
### {227}{}{Rangers are elite fighters and masters of desert survival. These skills allow us to protect the law and restore order in the Wastelands. To return the Law to these lands is our main mission.}
{227}{}{游骑兵是沙漠生存的精英战士和大师。这些技能使我们能够保护法律，恢复荒原的秩序。将法律归还这些土地是我们的主要使命。}
### {228}{}{Are you doing this for free?}

### {229}{}{Our patronage is taxed and subject to a number of restrictions. If people refuse to accept the Law and our other conditions, we refuse to help them.}
{229}{}{我们的赞助是征税的，并受到一些限制。如果人们拒绝接受法律和我们的其他条件，我们就拒绝帮助他们。}
### {230}{}{What kind of Law is this?}
{230}{}{这是什么样的法律？}
### {231}{}{A small set of simple rules and prohibitions that should be strictly adhered to. Those who grossly violate the Law will be punished. Often fatal.}

#Ranger at the Jackals
### {233}{}{But thanks for the search anyway. These savages have drunk too much blood from our brother. I am very glad that they paid with their lives for this.}
{233}{}{不过还是感谢你的搜索。这些野蛮人喝了我们兄弟太多的血。我很高兴他们为此付出了生命。}
### {234}{}{This is no longer required. We found the remains of a patrol in a jackal den in the north. You know about this place.}
{234}{}{不再需要这样做。我们在北部的一个豺狼窝里发现了一支巡逻队的遗骸。你知道这个地方。}
### {235}{}{What a surprise. Sad to hear that.}
{235}{}{真是个惊喜。听到这个消息很难过。}
### {236}{}{How do I find the missing patrol?}
{236}{}{我该如何找到失踪的巡逻队？}
### {237}{}{Most likely, it will be possible to locate their coordinates with the help of a walkie-talkie, if it still works for them. Perhaps they heard about the patrolmen in the nearest settlements. Finally, you can just go to that area and look for traces of rangers blindly in the middle of the desert.}
{237}{}{最有可能的是，如果对讲机仍然对他们有效的话，就可以在对讲机的帮助下找到他们的坐标。也许他们听说了最近定居点的巡警。最后，你可以去那个地区，在沙漠中央盲目地寻找护林员的踪迹。}
### {238}{}{The latter is not pleasing, but it is at least something.}
{238}{}{后者并不讨人喜欢，但它至少是有意义的。}

### {239}{}{Strangely enough, the Jackals are ready to make an alliance.}
{239}{}{奇怪的是，豺狼准备结盟。}
### {240}{}{It's out of the question! Jackals are cunning and aggressive, they are not inclined to dialogue. If they need an alliance, then it's probably a trick for profit, nothing more. I am sure that the General will fully agree with me.}
{240}{}{这是不可能的！豺狼狡猾好斗，不喜欢对话。如果他们需要一个联盟，那么这可能是一个牟利的把戏，仅此而已。我相信，将军将完全同意我的看法。}
### {241}{}{The rangers from the Northern Patrol are dead. They were killed by Jackals.}
{241}{}{北方巡逻队的护林员死了。他们被豺狼杀死了。}
### {242}{}{Damn it... I felt in my gut that it would come out that way. These savages have drunk too much blood from our brother. But thanks for the search. I will send the investigation report to the General.}
{242}{}{该死……我的直觉是，事情会这样发展的。这些野蛮人喝了我们兄弟太多的血。但谢谢你的搜索。我将把调查报告送交将军。}
### {243}{}{You're welcome.}
{243}{}{不客气。}
### {244}{}{The ranger from the northern Patrol has returned. True, one.}

### {247}{}{You're welcome.}
{247}{}{不客气。}
### {248}{}{What do you think about Jackals?}
{248}{}{你觉得豺狼怎么样？}
### {249}{}{The Jackals are one of the most disgusting gangs in the Wastelands. They are so wild that even their children cannot be distinguished from puppies. It breaks my heart to see an entire nation slide into such a life. Cannibalism, a ridiculous cult, hostility to all outsiders, even neighboring clans - is it possible to fall lower?}
{249}{}{豺狼是荒原上最恶心的帮派之一。它们太野了，甚至连它们的孩子都无法与小狗区分开来。看到整个国家陷入这样的生活，我心碎了。食人主义，一种荒谬的邪教，对所有外来者的敌意，甚至是相邻的部族――有可能堕落吗？}

# The criminal's family
### {250}{}{What do you say in defense of the murdered husband of that woman?}
{250}{}{你怎么为那个女人被谋杀的丈夫辩护？}
### {251}{}{Oh, this lady took you on the hook? Look, her husband was a criminal. He was engaged in robberies from farmers and attacks on travelers. For all this, he was justly executed in accordance with the Law. No one would have thought that he had a family.}
{251}{}{哦，这位女士让你上当了？看，她的丈夫是个罪犯。他参与了对农民的抢劫和对旅行者的袭击。为此，他被依法公正地处决了。没有人会想到他有一个家庭。}
### {252}{}{[Next]}
{252}{}{[下一个]}
### {253}{}{It's just a story for you. And for me, to be honest, too. But you have no idea what stupid things an angry female radscorpion can do. Something has to be done about it.}
{253}{}{这只是给你的一个故事。老实说，对我来说也是如此。但你不知道一只愤怒的雌性蛇蝎会做什么愚蠢的事情。必须采取措施。}
### {254}{}{[Next]}
{254}{}{[下一个]}
### {255}{}{But you can find a common language with her. No offense, but you look more like a peasant than a ranger, which means you can win her favor with great success.}
{255}{}{但你可以和她找到共同的语言。无意冒犯，但你看起来更像一个农民而不是护林员，这意味着你可以成功地赢得她的青睐。}
### {256}{}{What should I do?}
{256}{}{我该怎么办？}
### {257}{}{Just explain to her that she is no longer welcome in these lands. It will be better for everyone if she and her offspring go to another place.}
{257}{}{只要向她解释一下，她在这些地方已经不受欢迎了。如果她和她的后代去另一个地方，对每个人都会更好。}
### {258}{}{Okay, I'll try.}
{258}{}{好吧，我试试。}
### {259}{}{I'm not going to sort out other people's problems.}
{259}{}{我不会解决别人的问题。}

### {261}{}{You're welcome.}
{261}{}{不客气。}
### {262}{}{Wait a minute. I was informed of a very tragic event. The ferryman was found dead, and recently you and the refugees were seen at the ferry. A remarkable coincidence, isn't it?}
{262}{}{等一下。我被告知发生了一起非常悲惨的事件。摆渡人被发现死了，最近你和难民在摆渡车上被看到。这是一个了不起的巧合，不是吗？}
### {263}{}{I, uh, have nothing to do with it.}
{263}{}{I、 呃，跟它没有关系。}
### {264}{}{I hope so. Because sooner or later our guys will get to the truth. And you know how we honor the Law, especially so close to our citadel.}
{264}{}{我希望如此。因为我们的人迟早会知道真相的。你知道我们是如何遵守法律的，尤其是离我们的城堡这么近。}
### {265}{}{Of course, uh, you'll surely find the culprits. Well, I have to go...}
{265}{}{当然，呃，你肯定会找到罪魁祸首的。好吧，我得走了。。。}

#Farm Spy
### {270}{}{I want to report a spy. He's hiding in a shack on the old road...}
{270}{}{我想告发一个间谍。他躲在旧路上的一个棚屋里。。。}
### {271}{}{...Thanks for the tip. We'll send scouts there and try to catch him off guard. It's time to nail this bastard.}

### {273}{}{Did you know that the quartermaster's weapon was missing?}
{273}{}{你知道军需官的武器不见了吗？}

{274}{}{不，我没有被告知此事。我有更重要的事情要做，而不是去挖管理员的抹布。}
### {275}{}{I understand.}
{275}{}{我理解。}

#Stop dialog
### {280}{}{Damn it... You look like those ghouls from the south. I don't want to say anything bad, but you should be careful about appearing in public.}
{280}{}{该死…你看起来像南方的食尸鬼。我不想说什么不好的话，但你应该小心在公共场合露面。}
### {281}{}{I know. Not for the first time.}
{281}{}{我知道。这不是第一次了。}

{288}{}{就是他那软弱的儿子？人们经常期望他做出一些不恰当的举动，但到目前为止，还没有发生任何争吵。好吧，我不得不相信这个故事。但是，逃跑真的不可能吗？}
### {289}{}{And what do I have to do with it?}
{289}{}{我该怎么办？}
### {290}{}{You mean you just happened to be there? And that you have nothing to do with the merchant's death? Damn, it will be difficult to prove the opposite without witnesses.}
{290}{}{你是说你刚好在那里？你和商人的死没有任何关系？该死，如果没有证人，很难证明相反的情况。}
### {1290}{}{You mean you just happened to be there? And that you have nothing to do with the merchant's death? Damn, it will be difficult to prove the opposite without witnesses.}
{1290}{}{你是说你刚好在那里？你和商人的死没有任何关系？该死，如果没有证人，很难证明相反的情况。}
### {291}{}{That's how it was, Commander.}
{291}{}{事情就是这样，指挥官。}
### {292}{}{(shakes his head) Rednecks... What else can I expect from you? You're lucky no one saw the crime itself and that Flick's reputation was as shoddy as his merchandise. You can go now. But don't forget that we are always on guard.}
{292}{}{（摇摇头）红脖子。。。我还能指望你做什么？你很幸运，没有人看到犯罪本身，弗利克的声誉和他的商品一样低劣。你现在可以走了。但别忘了，我们总是保持警惕。}
### {293}{}{As you say, Commander.}
{293}{}{正如你所说，指挥官。}
### {294}{}{It would be better this way. I'll believe you for now, but don't forget that we are always on guard. And now you can go.}

{302}{}{别墅的农民仍然需要帮助。}
### {303}{}{ (looking up from his reports with a frown) Is the villa the oasis where, by some miracle, maize is grown in the middle of the desert? I sympathize with you. It's not easy for many now. The Red plague from Phoenix is spreading throughout Arizona, enslaving the population and seizing resources.}
{303}{}{（皱着眉头从他的报告中抬起头来）这座别墅是沙漠中央种植玉米的绿洲吗？我同情你。现在对很多人来说并不容易。来自凤凰城的红色瘟疫正在亚利桑那州蔓延，奴役人口并夺取资源。}

{304}{}{我记得我们关于别墅的谈话。}

### {312}{}{Really. To be honest, I did not expect this and gave the tasks only for the go-ahead. It's nice to see the performance.}
{312}{}{真正地老实说，我没有预料到这一点，我只是提前完成了任务。很高兴看到演出。}
### {313}{}{[Next]}
{313}{}{[下一个]}
### {314}{}{But as for the situation with the Villa, this issue should be decided by the general himself. Go straight to him, I'll tell the guards to let you through. Then it all depends on how you agree with him.}
{314}{}{但是关于维拉的情况，这个问题应该由将军自己决定。直接去找他，我会让警卫让你通过的。那就完全取决于你对他的看法。}
### {315}{}{Thank you, Commander.}
{315}{}{谢谢你，指挥官。}
### {316}{}{OK. If all this running around was in vain, I'll ruin your reputation for all of you.}

{320}{}{将军答应人们帮助别墅。}

{321}{}{妈的，你还说服老人吗？！我们还有更重要的事情要做，而不是拯救少数傲慢自大的农民的皮肤。你总是把我们看作强盗。但是，命令就是命令。别墅现在得到了可靠的保护。}
### {322}{}{To be honest, I'm not happy with this deal. You peasants of the Villa have always looked at us as robbers. And when the situation turned out to be critical, you try to take advantage of us. But don't worry, we keep our word - the Villa is now under reliable protection. I really hope that this union will not be an empty chatter.}
{322}{}{老实说，我对这笔交易不满意。你们庄里的农民总把我们当强盗看。当情况危急时，你会试图利用我们。但别担心，我们信守诺言――维拉现在得到了可靠的保护。我真的希望这次工会不会是一场空谈。}
### {323}{}{I understand you, Commander. I hope we work together.}

{336}{}{这还不是全部。南边不远处有一个Quartz营地。最近，一群移民在那里定居，但侦察员报告说，他们都消失得无影无踪。看看那里发生了什么。顺便说一句，制图师对这个地区很感兴趣，也可以和他谈谈。}

{362}{}{没错。有人向东部转达了游骑兵队的谈话。}
### {363}{}{So someone was spying on our broadcasts? This is not surprising. Our fight against crime causes rejection by many influential organizations in the east.

Your information may be useful in the future. And as a reward, you can take this hunting rifle.}
{363}{}{所以有人在监视我们的广播？这并不奇怪。我们打击犯罪的斗争遭到了东部许多有影响力的组织的拒绝。唯一奇怪的是别人掌握了广播技术。对于一个来自荒原的简单帮派来说，这几乎是不可能的。谢谢你的帮助。你的信息将来可能有用。作为奖励，你可以带上这把猎枪。}

### {379}{}{You're welcome.}
{379}{}{不客气。}
### {380}{}{OK.}
{380}{}{好啊}

### {390}{}{I want to report Ranger Garth's crimes.}
{390}{}{我想报告流浪者加思的罪行。}
### {391}{}{Aren't you taking on too much? I regularly have to deal with slander against the Rangers. Besides, Ranger Garth has a lot of good references. Anyway, I don't have time for this nonsense, get out of here.}
{391}{}{你是不是承担得太多了？我经常要处理对流浪者队的诽谤。此外，流浪者加思有很多很好的参考资料。不管怎样，我没有时间胡说八道，离开这里。}
### {392}{}{Um...}
{392}{}{嗯。。。}
### {393}{}{And yet William Garth turned out to be a criminal. Who would have thought? So many awards and recommendations... You know, peaceful life has spoiled this soldier. Once "retired", he began to see any outsider as a potential enemy. I'm afraid to imagine what will happen to me in such conditions.}
{393}{}{然而，威廉・加思却成了罪犯。谁会想到呢？这么多奖项和推荐。。。你知道，平静的生活宠坏了这个士兵。一旦“退休”，他就开始将任何局外人视为潜在的敌人。我不敢想象在这种情况下我会发生什么。}
### {394}{}{We all have our own problems. This is normal, Commander.}
{394}{}{我们都有自己的问题。这很正常，指挥官。}
### {395}{}{His story will be edifying for the rest of the rangers. And for you, Commander.}
{395}{}{他的故事将对其他护林员有所启发。为了你，指挥官。}

#Additional quests

{403}{}{不幸的是，我不在路上。也许还有其他任务？}

### {410}{}{I can help with long-range reconnaissance.}
{410}{}{我可以帮助进行远程侦察。}
### {411}{}{That would be very helpful. We lost one of our reconnaissance teams in the north, in the Mojave Desert. There is no one to send for a rescue operation yet. Try to find out what happened to the Rangers.}
{411}{}{那将非常有帮助。我们在北部莫哈韦沙漠失去了一支侦察队。目前还没有人可以派人进行救援行动。试着找出游骑兵队的遭遇。}
### {412}{}{I'll do my best.}
{412}{}{我会尽力的。}
### {413}{}{Well, if I'm around, I'll try.}

### {420}{}{Do you need a person to negotiate?}
{420}{}{你需要一个人来谈判吗？}
### {421}{}{There is one case just for you. We were waiting for a group of refugees from the east. But the scouts say that they turned off the path and moved towards Garage City. You'll probably be nearby, so look there and find out what made them change their route.}
{421}{}{只有一个案子适合你。我们在等一群来自东方的难民。但侦察员说，他们离开了小路，向车库城移动。你可能就在附近，所以看看是什么让他们改变了路线。}
### {422}{}{Of course, I'll find these guys and shake the whole truth out of them.}
{422}{}{当然，我会找到这些家伙，并从他们身上揭露全部真相。}

### {430}{}{I managed to find refugees in Garage City. But they were already dead by my arrival.}
{430}{}{我设法在车库城找到了难民。但我到达时他们已经死了。}
### {431}{}{Damn it. What happened?}
{431}{}{该死，发生了什么事？}
### {432}{}{They were killed like dogs. Locals don't like outsiders.}
{432}{}{他们被杀得像狗一样。当地人不喜欢外来者。}
### {433}{}{Well, you could say they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.}
{433}{}{你可以说他们在错误的时间出现在错误的地点。}
### {434}{}{I have no idea.}
{434}{}{我不知道。}
### {435}{}{Eh. Even scavengers nowadays are ready to commit crimes because of hatred for outsiders. As you can see, this world needs a firm hand capable of keeping people behind the criminal line.}
{435}{}{呃，现在的拾荒者也因为对外来者的憎恨而准备犯罪。正如你所看到的，这个世界需要一只坚定的手，能够把人们挡在犯罪线后面。}
### {436}{}{[Next]}

### {439}{}{It's not for you, but for the safety of the Villa.}
{439}{}{这不是为了你，而是为了别墅的安全。}
### {440}{}{I managed to find refugees in Garage City. They were intimidated on behalf of the Rangers.}
{440}{}{我设法在车库城找到了难民。他们代表游骑兵队受到恐吓。}
### {441}{}{So someone was posing as a ranger?}
{441}{}{所以有人假扮成护林员？}
### {442}{}{Exactly. Here is the badge of this scoundrel. He won't bother you anymore.}
{442}{}{确切地这是这个恶棍的徽章。他不会再打扰你了。}
### {443}{}{What tricks criminals will not go to to get their way. Surely he had many excuses for his lawlessness.}
{443}{}{罪犯不会去耍什么花招来为所欲为。毫无疑问，他无法无天有许多借口。}
### {444}{}{[Next]}
{444}{}{[下一个]}
### {445}{}{This is not the first time someone has staged sabotage in order to undermine our reputation. There are forces in the east that have our actions across their throats. But the world is changing - if criminals used to be engaged in survival, now they are organized and sponsored by customers. But nothing - we will cope with this infection.}
{445}{}{这已经不是第一次有人蓄意破坏我们的声誉了。东部的一些势力对我们的行动虎视眈眈。但世界正在改变――如果罪犯过去是为了生存，那么现在他们是由客户组织和赞助的。但什么都没有――我们将应对这种感染。}

### {450}{}{I plan to stay here for a while. Are there any tasks closer to the base?}
{450}{}{我打算在这里呆一段时间。有没有离基地更近的任务？}

### {453}{}{I know what caused the epidemic - Flick's irradiated product.}
{453}{}{我知道是什么导致了这种流行病――弗利克的辐照产品。}
### {454}{}{Did Flick sell radioactive products? There have been similar rumors behind him before, but no one has ever been able to prove his deceptions.}
{454}{}{弗利克卖放射性产品吗？他之前也有类似的传言，但从来没有人能够证明他的欺骗。}
### {455}{}{Obviously, he won't bother anyone else except earthworms.}
{455}{}{显然，除了蚯蚓，他不会打扰任何人。}
### {456}{}{Yes, I know about his death. Justice found him before we did. Thanks for the help, we'll figure it out for ourselves.}
{456}{}{是的，我知道他的死讯。正义在我们之前找到了他。谢谢你的帮助，我们会自己解决的。}
### {457}{}{Please.}
{457}{}{请}
### {458}{}{Goodbye.}
{458}{}{再见}
### {459}{}{Now he will not be able to get away.}
{459}{}{现在他将无法逃脱。}
### {460}{}{Exactly. But Flick had already gone to the wasteland for the trading circle. Hurry up before he goes too far. You should take all his irradiated goods... any way.}

### {462}{}{Oh, to go roasting in the wasteland again...}

### {463}{}{There will be no more problems from the Flick. Now he's trading in hell.}
{463}{}{Flick不会再有问题了。现在他在地狱里交易。}
### {464}{}{Is Flick dead? Damn, I didn't expect that you would decide on such an extreme measure. However, I don't want to know anything about this story. Thanks for getting rid of this problem.}
{464}{}{弗利克死了吗？该死，我没想到你会做出如此极端的决定。然而，我不想知道任何关于这个故事的事情。谢谢你解决了这个问题。}
### {465}{}{Goodbye.}
{465}{}{再见}
### {466}{}{Flick was left without his product. He will remember this lesson for a long time.}
{466}{}{弗利克没有他的产品。他会记住这一课很长时间的。}
### {467}{}{Great job! Flick may be a son of a bitch, but he's also an irreplaceable merchant. It's good that he saved his life and lost only the goods. Unfortunately, we don't have a reward for such a case, so take some of my supplies. (gives two stimpacks and an antidote) You can sell it to someone if you don't need it.}
{467}{}{干得好！弗利克可能是个婊子养的，但他也是一个无可替代的商人。幸好他救了自己的命，只损失了货物。不幸的是，这样的案子我们没有报酬，所以带上我的一些补给吧。（给两个刺激包和一种解药）如果你不需要，你可以卖给别人。}
