### {120}{}{This old photon converter is breaking down completely. It has become impossible to repair it. Its performance dropped below 35%, which is enough to constantly power only the Systematizer and Control Hall. He is more likely to drop me out to the wasteland than risk his safety.

### {150}{}{This tower... It is enormous! Even with abandoned levels and blocked stairs, it's a huge, almost living mechanism, filled with loads of cameras, sensors, and automated doors. Also, you need to observe the population, turrets, department cooperation, and a lot of other things. No, the human can't do that. At least one human alone... I think he somehow plugged himself into the Systematizer and uses it to control all this tech. At least that's what I would try to do, if I were him.}
{150}{}{这座塔。。。太棒了！即使有废弃的楼层和堵塞的楼梯，它也是一个巨大的、几乎是活的机构，里面装满了大量的摄像头、传感器和自动门。此外，你还需要观察人口、炮塔、部门合作以及许多其他事情。不，人类不能那样做。至少有一个人。。。我想他不知怎么把自己插入了Systematizer，并用它来控制所有这些技术。至少如果我是他，我会努力做到这一点。}
