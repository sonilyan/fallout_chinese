{113}{}{Do you think I might be able to trade with you?}
{114}{}{Where are you headed?}
{115}{}{Bye.}
{116}{}{Well, I don't see why not, considering you helped us out in a pinch and all. Sure, why not.
 Here's what I got.}
{117}{}{[Barter.]}
{118}{}{I changed my mind.}
{119}{}{I know I've seen you somewhere. Holy shit! You're the one on all those wanted posters! Look, we
 don't want no trouble. You go your way and we'll go our way. I won't even tell anyone we've seen you.
 Now go!}
{120}{}{Hey! You're the one on all those wanted posters. Don't worry, I won't turn you in; as I recall,
 I'm wanted inn'a couple places myself. Now, you wanted to trade...}
{121}{}{[Barter.]}
{122}{}{Good enough, then. We got to get going. Don't worry, I won't tell the law I saw you.}
{123}{}{Wait a minute! I've heard of you. You're the do-gooder that's running around saving and helping
 people. We don't like your kind, so buzz off!}
{124}{}{I've heard good things about a person fitting your description. I guess it would be all right
 to trade some of our cargo to you. Here's what I got.}
{125}{}{[Barter.]}
{126}{}{Bye.}
{127}{}{I've heard of you. You're that bad-ass going around raising a ruckus all over the place. I've
 been meanin' to meet you so I can shake your hand. Thinking of all the rude and crude rumors about you
 just brings a tear to my eye. It would be my honor to trade with you.}
{128}{}{[Barter.]}
{129}{}{Bye}
{130}{}{Word is you or someone who looks like you has been causing trouble lately. I don't do business
 with your kind. Sorry.}
{131}{}{I don't know what you're wanted for and I don't rightly care. We don't do business with your
 type.}
{132}{}{Why don't you...'do good' somewhere else. }
{133}{}{I'm sure a person of your reputation can find supplies elsewhere.}
{134}{}{State your business.}
{135}{}{Where are you headed?}
{136}{}{What's your cargo?}
{137}{}{Bye.}
{138}{}{Ug.}
{139}{}{That's...nice. You have a nice day now. }

# No
{306}{}{What do I look like? A traveling agent? Make your own contacts, sonny. [The caravan master grins.] I can
 always show you the way to Nunya's Business though.}
{1306}{}{What do I look like? A traveling agent? Make your own contacts, babe. [The caravan master grins.] I can
 always show you the way to Good Times City though.}
{307}{}{Really, where's that?}
{308}{}{[The caravan master stares at you, then laughs.]}
{309}{}{Fine, keep your secrets.}
