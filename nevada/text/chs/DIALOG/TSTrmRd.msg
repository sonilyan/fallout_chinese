#{103}{}{You learned about the existence of a large radio station halfway between Reno and Vault 8.}

#{127}{}{Done. [You notice that the status of military-government stations is assigned only to a few units on the territory of Nevada. Moreover, they are located in remote places - in the heart of deserts, in the mountains, etc. - where the greatest coverage area is provided, and is hard to detect the station itself.]}
{127}{}{完成。[您注意到，政府军驻地的地位只分配给内华达州境内的少数部队。此外，它们位于偏远地区――沙漠的中心地带、山区等地――覆盖面积最大，很难探测到空间站本身。]}
#{128}{}{Apparently, these strong points of radio communication were very important for the military.}
{128}{}{显然，这些无线电通信的强项对军队来说非常重要。}
#{129}{}{In the state there is a quite a lot of points of communication, but one of the supporting military government stations is located to the South-East from your own vault, near the pre-war town of Lovelock (now there's probably only ruins).}

#{130}{}{The last sessions were carried out... A couple of years ago! More precisely, someone outside of the state tried to send a signal to Area 51, but, apparently, no one responded. However, it could be some automated message. The source of the signal is encrypted.}

#{133}{}{(Until the last days before the great War, reports had been pretty sparse. Shortly before the War, the number of broadcasts has increased dramatically. Mostly they were between military headquarters and field laboratories, strongly encrypted. It seems pretty suspicious to you. Did the elites know of the impending war, and even its timing? Curiously, some broadcasting happened *after* the war. However, it could be some automated message.)}
{133}{}{（直到大战前的最后几天，报道还很少。战争前不久，广播的数量急剧增加。它们大多位于军事总部和野战实验室之间，高度加密。你觉得很可疑。精英们知道即将到来的战争，甚至知道战争的时机吗？奇怪的是，战后发生了一些广播。但是，它可能是一些自动消息。）}
#{134}{}{See the last broadcast.}
{134}{}{看最后一次广播。}
#{135}{}{In addition to the standard automation procedures, someone, using this terminal, had been tracking a variable location point of the radio signal. After a little digging in the parameter values, you suddenly find out that this point is... You. Looks like someone watched your movements, thanks to a bug planted into your Pip-Boy.}
{135}{}{除了标准的自动化程序外，有人用这个终端跟踪无线电信号的一个可变位置点。在对参数值进行了一点挖掘之后，您突然发现这一点是...你。好像有人看了你的动作，多亏了你的皮普小子身上插了一只虫子。}
#{136}{}{What a surprise...}
{136}{}{真是个惊喜...}
#{137}{}{In the state there is quite a lot of points of radio communication, but one of the supporting military government stations is located to the South-East from your own vault. It seems it's in the same place where the village of Cheyenne is located. Worth to ask the locals about it.}
{137}{}{在这个州有很多无线电通讯点，但是一个支持军事政府的电台就在你自己的地下室的东南部。好像和夏延村在同一个地方。值得问问当地人。}
