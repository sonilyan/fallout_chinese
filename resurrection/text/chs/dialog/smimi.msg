{200}{}{你看到一个僵尸脸上带着不安的表情。}

{250}{}{你看到咪咪了。她又陷入了沉思。}
#{300}{}{What are we gonna do?}
{300}{}{我们该怎么办？}
#{301}{}{Leave! You're not welcome here anymore.}
{301}{}{快走！你不再受欢迎了。}

#{303}{}{Get lost!}
{303}{}{滚开！}
#{350}{}{Something's going on in Falcon's Flight. You went to have a look in there.}
{350}{}{Falcon的飞行出了问题。你去那里看了看。}
#{351}{}{Something's going on in Falcon's Flight. You went to have a look in there.}
{351}{}{Falcon的飞行出了问题。你去那里看了看。}
#{450}{}{I might look like I'm feeble but you can bet I ain't!}
{450}{}{我可能看起来很虚弱，但你可以打赌我没有！}
#{451}{}{Die, smoothskin!}
{451}{}{死吧，光滑的皮肤！}
#{500}{}{Sorry, I'm not in the mood to talk to you. If you need something, talk to Rene. I'm not serving here. It's useless. Besides, I've got tougher nuts to crack.}
{500}{}{对不起，我没心情和你说话。如果你需要什么，和雷内谈谈。我不在这里服役。没用的。另外，我还有更难对付的坚果。}
#{501}{}{What are those, exactly?}
{501}{}{那到底是什么？}
#{502}{}{I just wanted to ask you a few questions.}
{502}{}{我只想问你几个问题。}
#{503}{}{In that case, good-bye.}
{503}{}{那样的话，再见。}
#{504}{}{Ah, what ghoulie? Help!}
{504}{}{啊，什么僵尸？救命啊！}
#{505}{}{Yeah! Make bye-bye.}
{505}{}{是 啊！再见。}
#{550}{}{[She looks you over, irritated.] Don't act like you don't know anything. The whole town hates us ghouls. People don't wanna come to Falcon's Flight no more and we're scared to go out. It's getting worse and worse. I'm dreading the idea of what's gonna come.}
{550}{}{别装作什么都不知道。整个镇子都恨我们这些僵尸。人们不想再去Falcon的航班了，我们害怕出去。情况越来越糟了。我害怕会发生什么。}
#{551}{}{Is it really that bad? What have you done to cause this?}
{551}{}{真的有那么糟吗？你做了什么导致这一切？}
#{552}{}{I'm sorry to hear that. Can I help in any way?}
{552}{}{听到这个消息我很难过。我能帮忙吗？}
#{553}{}{I see. I won't bother you. Good-bye.}
{553}{}{我懂了。我不会打扰你的。再见。}
#{600}{}{I'm not telling you anything. You'll have to save those questions of yours for someone else.}
{600}{}{我什么都没告诉你。你得把你的问题留给别人。}
#{601}{}{What's wrong with you? Something on your mind?}
{601}{}{你怎么了？你在想什么？}
#{602}{}{As you wish. I'm leaving.}
{602}{}{如你所愿。我要走了。}
#{700}{}{[She smiles sadly.] That stupid head of yours wouldn't understand. But if you want to help us, there's one thing you could do for me, what do you say? You'll get something in return afterwards.}
{700}{}{[她伤心地笑了笑]你那愚蠢的脑袋不会明白的。但是如果你想帮助我们，有一件事你可以帮我，你说呢？以后你会得到回报的。}
#{701}{}{Yaaaay, }
{701}{}{是啊，}
#{702}{}{ wants!}
{702}{}{欲望！}
#{703}{}{Naay. Bye!}
{703}{}{不。再见！}
#{750}{}{The only thing we're guilty of is that we were in the worst place possible when the apocalypse came. Had we been a few yards closer, we could of died as well and good riddance. We became ghouls instead. In the eyes of the local people, we've committed the biggest crime.}
{750}{}{我们唯一有罪的是，当世界末日来临时，我们正处在最糟糕的境地。如果我们再靠近几码的话，我们也会死掉的。我们变成了僵尸。在当地人看来，我们犯下了最大的罪行。}
#{751}{}{Nobody should suffer just because of their appearance. Can I help in any way?}
{751}{}{没有人应该因为外表而受苦。我能帮忙吗？}
#{752}{}{I understand your irritation. I won't bother you anymore.}
{752}{}{我理解你的愤怒。我不会再打扰你了。}
#{800}{}{You'd help ghouls? I'm not in a situation where I could refuse such offer. But you realize the danger you're putting yourself in, right? There's enough folk in Sedit who wouldn't shy away from hurting you just 'cause you're consorting with ghouls.}
{800}{}{你会帮助僵尸？我不能拒绝这样的提议。但是你意识到你把自己置于危险之中，对吗？塞迪特有足够多的人不会因为你和僵尸勾结就回避伤害你。}

{802}{}{我不是那种逃避问题的人。我能帮忙吗？}
#{803}{}{Oh, forget it, then. I don't want to risk my neck. I'd better be going.}
{803}{}{哦，算了吧。我不想冒险。我最好走了。}
#{900}{}{See, Falcon's Flight's provisions are getting thin. Local shopkeepers won't sell anything to us anymore so there's no way to replenish them. But you could get what we need easily.

{900}{}{看，猎鹰号的飞行补给越来越少了。当地的店主不会再卖给我们任何东西，所以没有办法补充。但你很容易就能得到我们需要的。如果你给我带来十五瓶啤酒，十块水果和五个香根草，我会付你他们的价钱，再加上一些东西。你怎么说？}

#{950}{}{Me, Rene and Ivet need to leave Sedit. We can't wait until the worst happens. A police unit started to guard Falcon's Flight after the last attack, but that's just a whim of the town council. They could change their minds at any time.

{950}{}{我，Rene和Ivet需要离开Sedit。我们不能等到最坏的情况发生。上次袭击发生后，一支警察部队开始守卫Falcon的航班，但那只是镇议会的一时兴起。他们随时可能改变主意。我们必须尽快离开。不幸的是，除非我们至少有一些在荒野中生存的基本设备，否则我们就无法启程。}
#{951}{}{So why don't you get what you need?}
{951}{}{那你为什么不得到你需要的呢？}
#{952}{}{The thing is, I've got to go. Good-bye.}
{952}{}{问题是，我得走了。再见。}
#{1000}{}{Because elementary supplies or armed guards cannot be acquired without caps, lots of caps we don't have. First, we need to get our hands on some cash.

There would be no harm in him losing part of his wealth.}
{1000}{}{因为没有瓶盖就无法获得基本补给或武装警卫，所以我们没有很多瓶盖。首先，我们需要弄点现金。我知道有一个地方有足够的贵重物品来支付我们所有的费用-警长别墅。警长从来都不喜欢我们，他可能是塞迪特最富有的人。他失去一部分财富是没有坏处的。}

{1050}{}{不完全是。我只需要你挑一个保险箱。几年前，警长被贿赂了几块金块，把它们藏在保险箱里。我之所以知道这一点，是因为警察喝了几杯啤酒和龙舌兰酒后，往往会比他们想的要多松一点舌头。如果你能弄到他们，我肯定他们会为整个旅程买单，也许更多。我们终于可以离开了。}

#{2050}{}{You're wasting your time. You won't change our decision. Besides, there's something else I wanted to talk to you about. Maybe you've already heard someone kidnapped the sheriff's son.

Please, talk to Jeffrey. He could get you to meet the sheriff.}
{2050}{}{你在浪费时间。你不会改变我们的决定。另外，还有件事我想和你谈谈。也许你已经听说有人绑架了警长的儿子。有些人会为了一把瓶盖做任何事。我希望你能找到那孩子。我确实不太喜欢警长，但他不该得到那么可怕的东西。拜托，和杰弗里谈谈。他可以带你去见警长。}

#{2200}{}{Don't underestimate Rodriguez. He's getting plenty of caps from his casino. Caps he can use to hire the best bodyguards with. Nobody can get to him.

You'd find yourself in big danger.}

#{2250}{}{I hope we have at least a small chance now. I guess I should have told you in the beginning that it's mainly because of Rodriguez we want to leave Sedit. He's a mobster in Lost Town who's been doing everything to turn the whole city against us. Recently he gave us an ultimatum ?? either we leave or he'll have us killed. I'm afraid the ultimatum's already expired and he's going to have us killed, even if we leave. Hopefully we'll now be able to pay for enough protection.}
{2250}{}{我希望我们现在至少有一点机会。我想我应该在一开始就告诉你，这主要是因为罗德里格斯，我们想离开塞迪特。他是迷失之城的一个暴徒，他想尽一切办法让整个城市都反对我们。最近他给我们下了最后通牒，要么我们走，要么他就杀了我们。恐怕最后通牒已经过期了，他要杀了我们，即使我们离开。希望我们现在能够支付足够的保护费。}
