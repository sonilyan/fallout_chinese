{100}{}{Hey there, how can I help you?}
{101}{}{What is this place?}
{102}{}{Nice looking car you got there, is it working?}
{103}{}{Nothing.}
#place...
{104}{}{Well, I used to sell cars, but that was a long time ago. Now I'm looking for junk, old parts, put them together...
 Try to make something that works. [Laughs.] You see that car there? That's my masterpiece, it took me five years to
 build it. It's not in good shape though, still have to work on its exhaust system, but it's working.}
{105}{}{Is it for sale?}
{106}{}{Looks good, see you later.}
#for sale...
{107}{}{Sorry, I want to keep this one. As long as I live, it will be my pride... To remind me how the world used to be
 a better place to live in. I shouldn't be telling you, but I might have a car for sale. It's in my safe stock, if you want
 to see, $1000 is my price.}
{108}{}{Alright, but it better be something.}
{109}{}{Let me ask you something first.}
{110}{}{That's too much for me right now. I'll be back.}
#all right...
{111}{}{Excellent. This is just an insurance policy, I have to pay my bills you know. Let me show you what you came
 for.}
{112}{}{[Follow him...]}
#nice looking car...
{113}{}{You bet it's working. Although it needs some more work around the exhaust pipes, fuel of course, and a set
 of tires. I might leave it that way just to make it harder for someone to steal it. Haha, just kidding. However, if
 you are interested, I've got a working one in my safe stock. If you have $1000 you can see my stock right now.}
{114}{}{Alright, but it better be something good.}
{115}{}{Let me ask you something first.}
{116}{}{That's too much for me right now. I'll be back.}
#ask something...
{117}{}{Sure, what you want to know?}
#comeagain...
{118}{}{Hey, you're back. Need anything?}
{119}{}{What did you say about that car, is it for sale?}
#
{120}{}{You got a lot of guts to show up here!}
{121}{}{Go away, I don't deal with criminals.}
{122}{}{Your kind is not welcome here!}
{123}{}{You can go back to wherever that is you came from.}
#
{124}{}{I remember you already bought a car. Anyway, you can upgrade your car to run more reliably, add some
 speed to it... It's a turbo charger and it will cost you $2000, interested?}
{125}{}{Alright, I can afford that...}
{126}{}{Not really, I have to go now.}
#door touched...
{127}{}{Stay away from there.}
{128}{}{Hey, I'm still here.}
{129}{}{Any particular reason for touching that door?}
{130}{}{I told you... Don't waste your words!}
#
{131}{}{Here you go... just don't drop it, hehe... [Grins.]}
{132}{}{Right, see you.}
#
{133}{}{I remember you already bought a car and I sold you that turbocharger. So there's nothing else I can do for you
 right now.}
{134}{}{Some other time then.}
#
{135}{}{[Smiles.] Nah, my car kinda runs on its own so there's no need for that fancy thing, which is fine with me.}
