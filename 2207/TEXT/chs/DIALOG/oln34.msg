### {40}{}{Request is processing. [he gets silent again. This lasts for another ten seconds.] Request denied. The Defender squad warrior is too valuable to waste his armor on weapon testing. Proceed in accordance with protocol E-11: the initiator of the experiment - that is you - will be issued with a suit of Defender armor. A firing command commences testing on the initiator wearing the suit. The testing is considered successful if the initiator is alive at the end of it. Otherwise, dr. Crank have to find another assistant to commence additional testing, and engineers will be assigned with a task of improving the armor's capabilities. The suit, in this case, should be immediately removed from the body and processed in the repairing facilities. }
