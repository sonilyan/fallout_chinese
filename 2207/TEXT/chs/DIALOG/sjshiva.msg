{11}{002}{你好，我是}
### {12}{002}{...}
{12}{002}{。。。}


### {20}{}{Yeah-yeah. So, what brings you to this extremely beautiful and interesting place? Wait a minute, let me guess: you came here from some half-dead farm because you could barely make ends meet, and decided to live by the robbery and alcoholism, like a real thug.}
{20}{}{是的是的。那么，是什么把你带到这个美丽而有趣的地方呢？等一下，让我猜猜：你从一个半死不活的农场来到这里，因为你几乎入不敷出，决定像一个真正的暴徒一样，靠抢劫和酗酒生活。}

{21}{003}{好你可以这么说。}

### {140}{}{[Shiva hears you out. At first, she was mostly rolling her eyes, but after a couple of minutes in, you had her full attention.] You are really from there! This is nuts! Usually, we are not very fond of their people, because when we approach the tower, they tend to kill us. So I wouldn't advise you to talk around here about where you are from. The others won't listen to your story and will beat the shit out of you right after the phrase "I am from Olympus." But I'll keep it a secret. [she smiles, scratching her forehead, and moves a lock of hair from her eyes] It was really interesting... Well, don't hang around here for long - one of my boyfriends could think that you are a competitor [she giggles]}
{140}{}{[湿婆听你说完。一开始，她大部分时间都在翻白眼，但几分钟后，你就完全注意到了。]你真的来自那里！这太疯狂了！通常，我们不太喜欢他们的人，因为当我们走近塔楼时，他们往往会杀了我们。所以我不建议你在这里谈论你来自哪里。其他人不会听你的故事，会在“我来自奥林巴斯”这句话之后把你打得落花流水。但我会保守秘密。[她微笑着，抓着额头，移开眼睛里的一缕头发]这真的很有趣。。。好吧，不要在这里呆太久――我的一个男朋友可能会认为你是竞争对手[她咯咯笑着说]}
### {141}{996}{Okay, I'm leaving already.}
{141}{996}{好吧，我已经走了。}
