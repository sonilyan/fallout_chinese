#Текстовый файл для криттера << отец ГГ >> 
#Номер строки в scripts.lst << 65 >>
#############################################################
#Структура файла:
#строки 1-9 - описание персонажа;
#строки 10-29 - знакомство с песонажем;
#строки 30-99 - пока не знаю, но думаю, что пригодятся...
#Далее, по веткам диалога.
#Каждая ветка кратна 100, т.е. 100 - одна тема диалога, 200 - другая.
#Реплики персонажа идут через 10, т.е. 100, 110, 120 и т.д. При чем 
#для реплики 100 использовать Node010, для реплики 240 - Node024.
#Для ответов игрока - сквозная нумерация, т.е. на реплику 650 ответы будут 651, 652, 653 и т.д. 
#Для особых ответвлений использовать дополнительные цифры (например, реплика 360 делится на 3601 и 3602,
#это же касается процедуры Node, ответы же будут в обычной форме - 361, 362 и т.д.)
#############################################################
#Такая организационная система не позволяет создавать слишком сложные диалоги,
#что для меня лично очень хорошо!!!

{100}{}{Hello, son! How are you? }
{1001}{}{[his eyes are darting around as if he is looking for something and can't find it.]}
{101}{}{Hey, dad! I don't know what to get myself busy with.}
{102}{}{I'm not in the mood! Everything is bad! [frown and turn away]}
{103}{}{Hey, dad! Just hanging, having nothing to do. Did you lose something?}
{104}{}{Hello! Just wanted to distract you a little from your work!}
{105}{}{Hello! Remember you asked me to find your wrench?}
{1101}{}{Well... You can go play with your brother. Or bother your mom.}
{1102}{}{Hmm... Maybe you want to help me?}
{1103}{}{Yes, I lost one thing. Hey, have you seen a professional detective around here? [he winks at you]}
{111}{}{Of course! What do I need to do? A detective-man is ready for a mission!}
{112}{}{Yeah, yeah, I know. [sigh and leave]}
{113}{}{Uh. Right! I'm gonna go stab someone with a fork.}

{120}{}{[dad kindly smiles] Alright, here's a top priority assignment for you: do you remember my wrench? A small one, with a wooden handle? I can't fix this sink without it, and I don't remember where I could've put it... Maybe mom has seen it? Oh, and where did mom go? It's always like that...}
{121}{}{Nah. This mission is too hard, even for a detective-man. I'll come by later, okay?}
{122}{}{Mission is taken. Citizen, await for delivery of your belonging in the nearest future!}
{123}{}{Why do you need the help of a detective-man for this? Just try to remember where you saw it last!}

{130}{}{[dad wrinkles his forehead even more than usual] No, I can't remember. All I have on my mind is work.}
{131}{}{You just need to restore the chain of events! Try to remember where you saw it, then what you were doing with it - and that's it! Come on, try!}
{132}{}{Gee, dad, what a memory you have. Okay, I'll go look for it. [leave to go find mom]}

{140}{}{Yes, I remember! [he smiles again] Did you find it?}
{141}{}{I'm trying my best, but still to no avail. Maybe you remembered something else?}
{142}{}{Yes! Here it is! [give dad his treasured wrench]}

{150}{}{Oh wow, you are the real detective-man! Thanks, dude, you helped me out so much! What can I thank you with?... Oh yeah! I know that you are not a grown-up yet, and the violence is always a bad option, but - just in case - take this. [he hands you a knuckle] What if you have to defend yourself from the creatures of the outside?}
{151}{}{What a cool thing! Awesome! Thanks! }
{152}{}{Wow! Nice! I'll go try it on someone.}
{153}{}{Hope I'll never have to use it.}

{160}{}{Okay, so... Hmm... Huh... Yeah. And then I... And he is... Of course! Brook, the father of your friend Catty! He's the one I gave it to! Aren't you a smart one? Just like your dad! Thanks, son!}
{161}{}{Hah! Easy-peasy!}
{162}{}{Come on, it's not that hard to be smart. [humbly pick the ground with a foot]}

{1000}{}{Hey, son!}
{1001}{}{How are you feeling? How's your tummy?}
{1002}{}{Listen, now is not a good time. Go play with your brother.}
{1003}{}{Go bother your mom, please.}
{1004}{}{Don't distract me now, be so kind.}
{1005}{}{Who is the detective-man, hmm?}
{1006}{}{Go bother your mom, please.}
{1007}{}{Come on kid, don't distract me. Go to mom, bother her.}
{1008}{}{I will definitely play with you, but I need to finish here..}

{1014}{}{No, later.}
{1015}{}{Now it's not the time, kid.}
{1016}{}{Son, not now.}
{1017}{}{A little later, alright?}
{1018}{}{No, a little later.}
