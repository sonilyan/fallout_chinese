#{102}{}{Hello again.}
{102}{}{又来了。}
#{103}{}{Leave me alone.}
{103}{}{别管我。}
#{110}{}{[This ordinary-looking man quietly sips from a bottle. He looks lost in his melancholic thoughts.]}
{110}{}{[这个相貌平平的人静静地啜饮着一瓶酒。他似乎沉浸在忧郁的思绪中。]}
#{111}{}{Hey, man, why the long face?}
{111}{}{嘿，老兄，为什么长脸？}
#{112}{}{Hey, you wanna share a drink?}
{112}{}{嘿，你想和我喝一杯吗？}
#{113}{}{You know, trying to drink your sorrows away only delays the inevitable.}

#{114}{}{Hello, who are you?}
{114}{}{你好，你是谁？}
#{115}{}{[Leave him.]}
{115}{}{[离开他。]}
#{120}{}{What? [the man slowly looks up] Ah, no, don't worry.}
{120}{}{什么？[那人慢慢抬起头]啊，不，别担心。}
#{121}{}{But I want to know!}
{121}{}{但我想知道！}
#{122}{}{Are you always so reserved?}
{122}{}{你总是那么矜持吗？}
#{123}{}{}
{123}{}{}
#{124}{}{Well, if you say so.}
{124}{}{好吧，如果你这么说的话。}
#{125}{}{Thank you, but I'm not looking to cry on anyone's shoulder.}
{125}{}{谢谢，但我不想在任何人的肩膀上哭泣。}
#{126}{}{If I said I wanted to hear you out, then it's best you start talking.}
{126}{}{如果我说我想听你说完，那你最好开始说话。}
#{127}{}{Just tell me already.}
{127}{}{已经告诉我了。}
#{128}{}{You know, you really need to talk it out. Helps much better than alcohol.}
{128}{}{你知道，你真的需要说出来。比酒精更有效。}
#{129}{}{Well, if you say so.}
{129}{}{好吧，如果你这么说的话。}
#{130}{}{What?! [he hisses through his teeth] What do you know? Who the hell are you, anyway? Just someone who wandered in from the wastes! [he waves his hand] Leave me alone!}
{130}{}{什么？！你知道什么？你到底是谁？只是一个从荒野中溜走的人！[他挥挥手]离我远点！}
#{131}{}{Fine, chill out... }
{131}{}{好吧，冷静点。。。}
#{132}{}{Hm? [he gives you an irritated look] None of your business, leave me alone.}
{132}{}{嗯？[他生气地看了你一眼]不关你的事，离我远点。}
#{133}{}{How dare you?! Get on your knees and apologize!}
{133}{}{你怎么敢？！跪下道歉！}
#{134}{}{Sorry, it's probably none of my business... But did something happen?}
{134}{}{对不起，这可能不关我的事。。。但是发生什么事了吗？}
#{135}{}{Alright, if you say so.}
{135}{}{好吧，如果你这么说的话。}
#{136}{}{[He jerks angrily but, at the last moment, stops himself. It seems he isn't prone to violence.] Listen, just leave me alone!}
{136}{}{[他愤怒地抽搐着，但在最后一刻，他停了下来。他似乎不喜欢暴力。]听着，别管我！}
#{137}{}{Ha!}
{137}{}{哈！}
#{150}{}{Hm? [the man looks you over before looking back to his bottle] No, I don't.}
{150}{}{嗯？[那个男人回头看了看你]不，我没有。}
#{151}{}{Alright, how about a drink on me?}
{151}{}{好吧，我喝一杯怎么样？}
#{152}{}{Be honest - is it because you don't respect me?}
{152}{}{老实说-是因为你不尊重我吗？}
#{153}{}{And if I take it myself?}
{153}{}{如果我自己拿？}
#{154}{}{Are you always so rude?}
{154}{}{你总是这么粗鲁吗？}
#{155}{}{Fine, I'll leave you alone if you're not inclined to talk.}
{155}{}{好吧，如果你不想说话，我就让你一个人呆着。}
#{156}{}{Ugh, I can stand up for myself, don't worry.}
{156}{}{呃，我能挺过来的，别担心。}
#{157}{}{You? Hah, learn to get your nose out of the bottle first. Ciao, loser.}
{157}{}{你呢？哈，先学着把鼻子从瓶子里拿出来。再见，失败者。}
#{158}{}{Oh, sorry, I didn't mean anything by it... }
{158}{}{哦，对不起，我不是故意的。。。}
#{159}{}{Chill out, I'm going.}
{159}{}{冷静点，我要走了。}
#{160}{}{Yeah... Of course. Everyone needs to blow off steam from time to time.}
{160}{}{是 啊。。。当然。每个人都需要时不时地发泄一下。}
#{161}{}{Great. Seems like something happened to you. What's up?}
{161}{}{伟大的。你好像出事了。怎么了？}
#{162}{}{Yeah, because you come up to me minding my own business and try to... Forget it. Yeah, it's because I don't respect you. You ought to watch your tongue in this town.}
{162}{}{是啊，因为你来找我，管我自己的事，想。。。算了吧。是啊，因为我不尊重你。在这个镇上你应该小心说话。}
#{163}{}{[He raises an eyebrow] Good luck finding a pal around here. I don't make friends over drinks.}
{163}{}{[他扬起眉毛]祝你在这附近找到朋友。我不喝酒交朋友。}
#{164}{}{So, you don't respect me?}
{164}{}{所以，你不尊重我？}
#{165}{}{Ha! Another product of egocentrism.}
{165}{}{哈！自我中心主义的另一个产物。}
#{166}{}{Who? Me?!}
{166}{}{谁？我？！}
#{167}{}{Why? I still won't tell you anything important. I'm an ordinary worker... Just trying to unwind. And you're winding me back up. So... [he waves his hand] ...leave me alone, wanderer.}
{167}{}{为什么？我还是不告诉你任何重要的事情。我是一个普通的工人。。。只是想放松一下。你又把我逼回来了。所以。。。[他挥手]…别管我，流浪者。}
#{168}{}{Only when wanderers like you pester me. Goddammit, can't I get a quiet drink around here?!}
{168}{}{只有像你这样的流浪者缠着我。该死的，我不能在这附近安静地喝一杯吗？！}
#{169}{}{Yeah, probably. But it's been a while since I've seen people here who I can be open with. [he carefully looks you over] But... You know what the clutches of a snake entail.}
{169}{}{是的，可能吧。但我已经有一段时间没在这里见到我可以敞开心扉的人了。[他仔细地看着你]但是。。。你知道蛇的魔爪需要什么。}
#{170}{}{Yeah, probably. But it's been a while since I've seen people here who I can be open with. [he carefully looks you over] But... Where are you from, if you don't mind me asking?}
{170}{}{是的，可能吧。但我已经有一段时间没在这里见到我可以敞开心扉的人了。[他仔细地看着你]但是。。。如果你不介意我问的话，你是哪里人？}
#{171}{}{I'm from Reno.}
{171}{}{我来自雷诺。}
#{172}{}{I'm from a small settlement up north.}
{172}{}{我来自北方的一个小定居点。}
#{173}{}{None of your business.}
{173}{}{不关你的事。}
#{174}{}{Wha-?... }
{174}{}{什么-？。。。}
#{175}{}{In that case, my problems are none of yours. All the best, wanderer.}
{175}{}{那样的话，我的问题与你无关。祝你一切顺利，流浪者。}
#{176}{}{Is that so... }
{176}{}{是这样。。。}
#{177}{}{Ah... Well, it was nice chatting.}
{177}{}{啊。。。嗯，聊天很愉快。}
#{178}{}{So that's how it will be... }
{178}{}{所以事情就是这样。。。}
#{179}{}{Really? I thought there were no settlements apart from some Indians and raiders. It's nice to hear that the wastes have someone with a human face.}
{179}{}{真正地？我以为除了一些印第安人和掠夺者之外没有定居点。很高兴听到垃圾堆里有人长得像人。}
#{180}{}{So, what's troubling you?}
{180}{}{那么，你怎么了？}
#{181}{}{Just blowing off steam after a long day.}
{181}{}{在漫长的一天之后只是发泄一下。}
#{182}{}{Oh, I know the feeling - having to make a choice... Between what and what this time?}
{182}{}{哦，我知道那种感觉-必须做出选择。。。这一次在什么和什么之间？}
#{183}{}{Between hunger with an honest face and selfish satiety. You see, I have a dog, but it got hard to feed her, and now she had a litter of puppies. Wife had a rant that I didn't do anything about it, and we need to feed them and our earnings aren't too good... I had to crush their heads with a sledgehammer. My hands are still shaking at the memories... }
{183}{}{在诚实的饥饿和自私的满足之间。你看，我有一只狗，但它很难喂养她，现在她有一窝小狗。妻子大声说我什么也没做，我们需要养活他们，我们的收入也不太好。。。我不得不用大锤砸碎他们的头。我的手还在为回忆而颤抖。。。}
#{184}{}{I thought Reno was full of tough people who wouldn't worry about pups.}
{184}{}{我以为雷诺到处都是不担心小狗的坚强的人。}
#{185}{}{Ha! Wastelanders... This might be a tough city, but each man has his own complicated story. If you still haven't understood that, then you will with time.}
{185}{}{哈！荒地人。。。这可能是一个艰难的城市，但每个人都有自己复杂的故事。如果你还不明白，那你会慢慢明白的。}
#{186}{}{Hm. I'll need to think about this.}
{186}{}{嗯，我得考虑一下。}
#{187}{}{Yeah, of course, think. And... You know... Thank you for hearing me out.}
{187}{}{是的，当然，想想。还有。。。你知道的。。。谢谢你听我说完。}
#{188}{}{Of course! Any time.}
{188}{}{当然！随时都可以。}
#{189}{}{Pfft! Ha-ha! A man crying about some dead dogs! What a story!}
{189}{}{Pfft！哈哈！一个为死狗哭泣的人！真是个故事！}
#{190}{}{What the hell do you know?! You think you're some big man? [he hisses through his teeth] You're just some lowlife from the wastes, thinking he's great because he's the biggest animal around. [he waves his hand] Leave me alone. I don't need your "wisdom". Oh, and take these - [he throws a few condoms at your feet] - so the next generation doesn't have to deal with more of you.}
{190}{}{你到底知道什么？！你以为你是个大块头？[他用牙齿发出嘶嘶声]你只是一个废物中的低等生物，认为他很棒，因为他是周围最大的动物。[他挥挥手]离我远点。我不需要你的“智慧”。哦，拿着这些-[他朝你脚上扔了几个避孕套]-这样下一代就不用再和你们打交道了。}
#{191}{}{Ha-ha-ha! Bye, loser.}
{191}{}{哈哈哈！再见，失败者。}
#{192}{}{That must have been awful. I'm sorry you had to go through it.}
{192}{}{那一定很糟糕。很抱歉你不得不经历这一切。}
#{193}{}{Don't worry about - I'll get over it. And... You know... Thank you for hearing me out. Hold on - hey, barkeep! A beer for my friend! I'll pay!}
{193}{}{别担心-我会过去的。还有。。。你知道的。。。谢谢你听我说完。等等-嘿，酒吧老板！给我朋友一杯啤酒！我会付钱的！}
#{194}{}{Oh, thanks for that.}
{194}{}{哦，谢谢你。}
#{195}{}{Enjoy! This city needs people like you. You'll see, with time, Reno will be better thanks to people like you and me.}
{195}{}{好好享受！这个城市需要像你这样的人。你会发现，随着时间的推移，雷诺会因为你和我这样的人而变得更好。}
#{196}{}{Sure, take care.}
{196}{}{当然，保重。}
#{1126}{}{If I said I wanted to hear you out, then it's best you start talking.}
{1126}{}{如果我说我想听你说完，那你最好开始说话。}
#{1153}{}{And if I take it myself?}
{1153}{}{如果我自己拿？}
#{1158}{}{Oh, sorry, I didn't mean anything by it... }
{1158}{}{哦，对不起，我不是故意的。。。}
#{1162}{}{Yeah, because you come up to me minding my own business and try to... Forget it. Yeah, it's because I don't respect you. You ought to watch your tongue in this town.}
{1162}{}{是啊，因为你来找我，管我自己的事，想。。。算了吧。是啊，因为我不尊重你。在这个镇上你应该小心说话。}
#{1167}{}{Why? I still won't tell you anything important. I'm an ordinary worker... Just trying to unwind. And you're winding me back up. So... [he waves his hand] ...leave me alone, wanderer.}

[he hisses through his teeth] You're just some lowlife from the wastes, thinking she's great because she's the meanest animal around. [he waves his hand] Leave me alone. I don't need your "wisdom".

{1190}{}{你到底知道什么？！你以为你是个坚强的婊子？[他用牙齿发出嘶嘶声]你只是一个废物中的低等生物，认为她很棒，因为她是周围最卑鄙的动物。[他挥挥手]离我远点。我不需要你的“智慧”。哦，拿着这些-[他朝你脚上扔了几个避孕套]-这样下一代就不用再和你们打交道了。}
