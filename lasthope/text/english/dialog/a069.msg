{100}{}{Well, hello there stranger. Welcome to Canville. I'm Jerry, the sheriff of these parts. Just in case you didn't
 notice, we have a strict policy against weapon carrying in town, so be careful. Now, anything you have to ask, I would
 be glad to help.}
{101}{}{Is there any place to relax?}
{102}{}{Any shops around here?}
{103}{}{Got any job for me?}
{104}{}{What's going on in town?}
{105}{}{Nice to meet you Jerry, see you later.}
#again...
{106}{}{Hello again, something I can help you with?}
#place to relax...
{107}{}{Not really. If you are looking for entertainment or a place to stay for the night, you're out of luck, this is an
 industrial town after all. There's a fancy restaurant up north. If you feel hungry or thirsty that's the place for you.
 Besides that, we don't have any conventional hotels in town. Unless you want to spend a night in one of my two by two
 "rooms". [Laughs.] Just kidding stranger.}
{108}{}{I'll pass, let me ask you something else.}
{109}{}{That's a good one. See you later.}
#else...
{110}{}{Sure, I will be glad to help.}
#shops...
{111}{}{Of course. Ask around, most of these people are workers and traders so I'm sure you'll find anything you need.}
{112}{}{Alright. I'll do that.}
#job...
{113}{}{[Looking at his files.] I think I have something for you. One of the locals is having problems with his
 brahmin. He claims that they refuse to eat and started behaving weird. He is suspecting that someone is trying to
 poison his brahmin but he couldn't find any proof in the water or their food.}
{114}{}{So, any other possible cause?}
#
{115}{}{It could be wild dogs, rats... who knows. After all, I can't blame the man for being overly worried. He
 invested all his money into this. I promised I would check it out but I'm pretty busy around here so I trust you will
 help if you can, right?}
{116}{}{Sure, do I get something for this?}
{117}{}{Sorry, I have something else to do right now.}
#something...
{118}{}{Well, you can always use some more money, I guess. Listen, I don't expect this to be some wild-goose chase
 so I can give you $500 for the job.}
{119}{}{Fair enough. Tell me what has to be done?}
{120}{}{Have a nice day, Jerry.}
#job1...
{121}{}{Alright, his small farm is just east of here. I suspect if anything is happening there, it has to be during the
 night. So if you head there after sunset you can get a better clue of what's going on.}
{122}{}{I'm on it.}
#about job...
{123}{}{About that job?}
#
{124}{}{Do you have something to report?}
{125}{}{Nothing right now.}
{126}{}{A small deathclaw was causing all this trouble. This creature attacked me so I had to defend myself. I assume
 there's nothing more to do.}
#job done...
{127}{}{Good work, here's your payment. It's strange though, that deathclaw wandering around... I don't know
 how it got over the wall. I'll see you later, I have to discuss this matter with the locals.}
{128}{}{All right.}
#job2...
{129}{}{Well, one of the locals saw a few deathclaws in the forest, not far from here. That's just another
 confirmation of my suspicions that deathclaws have a lair in one of the forest caverns. One other thing is that small
 deathclaw you saw within the city walls. This can't be a coincidence so we must face the idea that we're in immediate
 danger of being overrun...}
{130}{}{I agree.}
{131}{}{I do not agree with you.}
#i agree
{132}{}{We have decided to deal with the deathclaws before things get out of control, that is, while we still can make a
 difference. I am gathering all available men for this so I'm asking if you can join us. There's a reward of $500 for every
 deathclaw we hunt down, to lift people's spirit a bit. I think we'll be ready to go in about a day or so and I expect
 you to give me an answer until then.}
{133}{}{No need to wait, I'll join.}
{134}{}{I'll talk to you later.}
#join...
{135}{}{Alright, you better collect your gear. We will head out around this time tomorrow. Don't be late
 or you'll miss all the fun [smiles].}
{136}{}{I'll try to be here on time.}
#going on in town...
{137}{}{Well, little bit of everything. We got ourselves a big ore mine which demands a lot of work. Its tunnels are
 stretching for kilometers and the only way of transportation through them is by simplified railway system. But very few
 workers go there because people say it's not worth the risk. Some tunnel sections collapsed, no investments whatsoever
 and the fact that the mine is over two hundred years old, made some say it might be time to shut it down for good.}
{138}{}{Interesting, anything else?}
{139}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{140}{}{Thanks, see you later.}
#anything else...
{141}{}{...we used to trade our ore for fuel, but we lost interest because fuel is too expensive and most of our people
 stopped driving cars. [Smiles.] Our power generators have been modified to use coal as fuel... I know it's not
 environment friendly but I don't trust these high tech generators. There's also a threat of a different kind, our town is
 constantly under attack by raiders and other groups so a lot of our resources are traded for weapons.}
{142}{}{Anything else going on?}
{143}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{144}{}{Thanks, see you later.}
#anything else...
{145}{}{Nothing for you to worry about. Come back any time if you need something.}
{146}{}{I'll keep that in mind.}
#anything else2...
{147}{}{Since we busted the deathclaws, people feel a little safer. The danger always lurks but I'm watching.}
{148}{}{Good to know. I'll keep in touch.}
#after one day...
{149}{}{It's time to head east and join the hunt. Are you going with us?}
{150}{}{Let's go.}
{151}{}{Sorry, I'm going to stay.}
#sheriff gone, never to return...
{152}{}{You're missing all the fun. But have it your way.}
#job nothing...
{153}{}{Nothing for now. Come back some other time.}
{154}{}{Sure thing.}
#maybe job1...
{155}{}{I told you about the situation on that farm. Find out what's the problem and you can earn $500, interested?}
#job 3... reminder,fuel station problem and mine collapse
{156}{}{All right, let's go.}
{157}{}{Sorry, I'm going to stay.}
#i don't agree...
{158}{}{Look, most of the locals are against my plan to attack the deathclaws. But let me tell you, there's nothing
 worse than waiting for something bad to happen. If the deathclaws attack us we might not live another day to talk about
 it. So the best solution could be the simplest one...}
{159}{}{So, what's your plan?}
#job2 taken, less than five days...
{160}{}{We are not yet ready to go. If you excuse me I have some work to do.}
{161}{}{Sure thing, see you later then.}
#on time +- 10 min...
{162}{}{All right then. Looks like we're ready to go. The others are waiting...}
{163}{}{[Follow him...]}
#float message after line 152...
{164}{}{Stick around, I might need your services later...}
