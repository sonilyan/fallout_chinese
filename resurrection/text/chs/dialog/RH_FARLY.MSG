#{650}{}{It's not a happy story. Today, hardly anybody knows that Julian and Leonard used to be best friends a long time ago.

{854}{}{城里的战争怎么会持续这么久？}
#{855}{}{You surely noticed the most important stuff by yourself - this town is torn into two halves that wage merciless war against each other.

Their long lasting feud destroyed the town so much it's on the verge of doom.}

{903}{}{啊，就这些。再见，神父。}
#{950}{}{Well you can try your luck at Julian's or Leonard's. These two are the only ones hiring here. But it won't be risk-free. They're both so paranoid they don't even trust their own men.

Apart from those, nobody has seen him for years.}
{950}{}{好吧，你可以去朱利安或莱纳德那碰碰运气。这两个是这里唯一招人的。但这不是没有风险的。他们都很偏执，甚至不相信自己的人。伦纳德甚至完全切断了与外界的联系。据说他躲在总部的地下室里，只有他最忠诚的人才能进去。除此之外，多年来没有人见过他。}

#{1050}{}{The North Side? I think you've seen everything important. Among the ruins, only the church, the bar and Leonard's headquarters still stand.

#{2000}{}{Julian and Leonard gradually reached a no-win situation. Each of them fortified himself in the part of the town he had seized, but neither was able to gain the upper hand.

#{2050}{}{[Father Farley thinks for a while.] No, sadly, I have never seen anything like this in my life. And I doubt that anyone here would tell you something else.

{2050}{}{[法利神父想了一会儿]不，很遗憾，我这辈子从没见过这样的事。我怀疑这里有人会告诉你别的事情。既然商队不来了，我们就完全与世隔绝了。你的护身符肯定是我们无法掌握的来自外部世界的许多东西之一。}

#{2250}{}{[Farley sighs.] It was a terrible night. They found Maria dead in some alley, stabbed so many times they almost didn't recognize her. I didn't see her myself, but surely it was a terrible sight. For doctor Reed, who was in charge of the autopsy and funeral, it had to be a terrible experience. Maybe that was one of the reasons she decided to leave.}
{2250}{}{这是一个可怕的夜晚。他们发现玛丽亚死在某个巷子里，被捅了很多刀，差点认不出她来。我自己没看见她，但那肯定是一个可怕的景象。对负责尸检和葬礼的里德医生来说，这一定是一次可怕的经历。也许这就是她决定离开的原因之一。}
#{2251}{}{Do you know someone who might know more about the murder scene?}
{2251}{}{你认识更了解谋杀现场的人吗？}
#{2252}{}{Ah. Let's get back to Maria.}
{2252}{}{啊。让我们回到玛丽亚身边。}
#{2253}{}{Doctor Reed? Who's that?}
{2253}{}{里德医生？那是谁？}
#{2300}{}{Sorry, I have no idea. But you can ask the local gravedigger. He usually slacks around the graveyard. He knows more about the dead than me. All in all, my task is to take care mainly of those still living.}
{2300}{}{对不起，我不知道。但你可以问问当地的掘墓人。他通常在墓地周围闲逛。他比我更了解死者。总而言之，我的任务主要是照顾那些还活着的人。}
#{2301}{}{Do you know someone who might know more about the murder scene?}
{2301}{}{你认识更了解谋杀现场的人吗？}
#{2302}{}{Thanks for the information, but let's get back to Maria.}
{2302}{}{谢谢你的消息，但让我们回到玛丽亚身边。}
#{2350}{}{No, I don't really know. I don't want to judge anyone, but it's true that Julian and Leonard had the strongest motif. But who is the actual murderer? That's the question.}
{2350}{}{不，我真的不知道。我不想评判任何人，但朱利安和伦纳德确实有着最强烈的主题。但真正的凶手是谁？这就是问题所在。}
#{2351}{}{Who knows. Let's get back to Maria.}
{2351}{}{谁知道呢。让我们回到玛丽亚身边。}
#{2400}{}{That, I don't know. Those who found her are long gone. I am sorry.}
{2400}{}{我不知道。找到她的人早就不见了。我很抱歉。}
#{2401}{}{What a pity. Let's get back to Maria.}
{2401}{}{真遗憾。让我们回到玛丽亚身边。}
#{2402}{}{Thank you anyway. Farewell, padre.}
{2402}{}{无论如何谢谢你。再见，神父。}
#{2450}{}{A note from doctor Reed? Yes, of course, I remember that. Shortly after Maria's death I found it pinned on the church's door. The doctor was probably in a hurry. She was one of the first who left this town. She probably foresaw what was going to happen to us. In the note she wrote that the ceremony was taken care of. It was weird to me that she took care of it instead of me, but I supposed it's the way George wanted it. I gave him the note and he didn't ask anything. He had a lot to worry about anyway.}
{2450}{}{里德医生的便条？是的，当然，我记得。玛丽亚死后不久，我发现它被钉在教堂的门上。医生可能很匆忙。她是第一批离开这个城市的人之一。她可能预见到了我们会发生什么。她在便条上写道，仪式已经办妥了。我觉得奇怪的是她代替我来处理它，但我想这是乔治想要的方式。我把纸条给了他，他什么也没问。反正他有很多事要担心。}
#{2451}{}{Thanks, padre. That'll be all.}
{2451}{}{谢谢，神父。就这些了。}
#{2452}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{2452}{}{我能问你点别的吗？}
#{2453}{}{So you didn't attend the funeral. Don't you at least know where her grave is?}
{2453}{}{所以你没有参加葬礼。你难道不知道她的坟墓在哪里吗？}
#{2500}{}{She was a local doctor. She left right after Maria's death. Doctor Moore took over Reed's clinic after his arrival.}
{2500}{}{她是当地的医生。玛丽亚死后她就离开了。里德到达后，摩尔医生接管了他的诊所。}
#{2501}{}{Do you know someone who might know more about the murder scene?}
{2501}{}{你认识更了解谋杀现场的人吗？}
#{2502}{}{Let's get back to Maria.}
{2502}{}{让我们回到玛丽亚身边。}
#{2550}{}{What are you saying? Alexa may have some quirks, but she's a religious woman. You should not be backtalking her like this.}
{2550}{}{你在说什么？Alexa可能有一些怪癖，但她是个虔诚的女人。你不应该这样反驳她。}
#{2551}{}{What are you saying? Alexa may have some quirks, but she's a religious woman. You should not be backtalking her like this.}
{2551}{}{你在说什么？Alexa可能有一些怪癖，但她是个虔诚的女人。你不应该这样反驳她。}
#{2552}{}{Think about it. Most of the poor you give caps to spend it on drugs at Alexa's. In this quarter, they're the cheapest, and easier obtain than food. Once they start with it, they can't stop and will do anything for Alexa just to get another dose.}
{2552}{}{好好想想。大多数穷人都会给你瓶盖，让他们在Alexa's买药。在这个季度，他们是最便宜的，而且比食物更容易买到。一旦他们开始服用，他们就不能停下来，为了再服用一剂，他们会为Alexa做任何事。}
#{2553}{}{Sorry, padre. It won't happen again. I'll be on my way.}
{2553}{}{对不起，神父。不会再发生了。我马上就来。}
#{2600}{}{Quiet! I am no longer willing to listen to your stories. There's enough wickedness in this town anyway. Leave.}
{2600}{}{安静的！我不再愿意听你讲故事了。反正这个镇上的邪恶已经够多了。离开。}
#{2601}{}{Whatever. Farewell.}
{2601}{}{无论什么。再会。}
#{2650}{}{[Farley becomes sad suddenly.] You speak wisely... And probably the truth. This is a terrible discovery. Sadly, I cannot stop accepting donations from Alexa. If I didn't help those people, they could end up even worse. Even if I can save only one soul this way, it's worth it. Thank you anyway. I will try hand out more food than caps and I will focus on warning against drugs. God bless you.}
{2650}{}{[法利突然伤心起来]你说话很明智。。。也许是事实。这是一个可怕的发现。可悲的是，我不能停止接受亚历克斯的捐赠。如果我不帮助那些人，他们的结局可能会更糟。即使我只能用这种方式拯救一个灵魂，这也是值得的。无论如何谢谢你。我会尝试分发更多的食物而不是瓶盖，我会集中注意戒毒。上帝保佑你。}
#{2651}{}{You're welcome, padre.}
{2651}{}{不客气，神父。}
#{2700}{}{Julian and Leonard's feud was getting worse. Once, they argued about Maria so much that Leonard left their business and started his own. That only aggravated their relationship. They surrounded themselves with mercenaries whose clashes threatened the entire town. The order was kept only with the greatest difficulties. And then it happened. [Farley falls silent.] They found Maria stabbed to death in some alley. Julian and Leonard started blaming her murder on each other, and began using direct violence afterwards. They threw their mercenary bands against each other and dragged this town into a neverending war.}
{2700}{}{朱利安和伦纳德的不和越来越严重。有一次，他们为玛丽亚吵得不可开交，伦纳德离开了他们的公司，开始了自己的事业。那只会加剧他们的关系。他们被雇佣军包围，他们的冲突威胁到整个城镇。秩序是在最困难的情况下维持的。然后就发生了。他们发现玛丽亚在某个巷子里被刺死了。朱利安和伦纳德开始互相指责她的谋杀，然后开始使用直接暴力。他们用雇佣军组织互相攻击，把这个城市拖进了一场无休止的战争。}
#{2701}{}{How come their conflict has lasted so long?}
{2701}{}{为什么他们的冲突持续了这么久？}
#{2702}{}{What a sad story. I would like to ask you something else.}
{2702}{}{多悲惨的故事啊。我想问你别的问题。}
#{2703}{}{Thanks for your story. Farewell, padre.}
{2703}{}{谢谢你的故事。再见，神父。}
#{2750}{}{[He smiles leniently.] Yes, you are right. That's a symbol of my faith. God's son died on the cross to redeem our sins.}
{2750}{}{是的，你说得对。那是我信仰的象征。神的儿子死在十字架上是为了赎罪。}
#{2751}{}{ symbol too! [Wave the talisman in front of his face.] You know?}
{2751}{}{符号也是！你知道吗？}
#{2752}{}{ symbol too! Lost. Didn't find? [Wave your hands in the air to indicate the shape of the talisman.] Round.}
{2752}{}{符号也是！迷路的。没有找到？[在空中挥手示意护身符的形状]圆形。}
#{2753}{}{Uh, dieded? Run away!}
{2753}{}{呃，死了？快跑！}
#{2800}{}{No, my child. I haven't ever seen such a talisman. You can put it down again.}
{2800}{}{不，我的孩子。我从没见过这样的护身符。你可以再把它放下。}
#{2801}{}{[Start waving faster.] You know?!}
{2801}{}{你知道吗？！}
#{2802}{}{[Hide the talisman.] Bai then!}
{2802}{}{[把护身符藏起来]那就拜！}
#{2850}{}{Indeed not! [He sighs.] But you know where they might recognize it? In the town of Sedit. It's big enough. I'll show you where it is. [He marks the city's location on your Pip-Boy map.] You should go there. Right now, if possible. May God lead your steps.}
{2850}{}{确实不是！[他叹了口气]但是你知道他们在哪里能认出它吗？在塞迪特镇。它够大了。我会告诉你它在哪里。[他在你的地图上标出了这个城市的位置]你应该去那里。现在，如果可能的话。愿上帝引领你的脚步。}
#{2851}{}{Indeed not! [He sighs.] But you know where they might recognize it? In the town of Sedit. It's big enough. I'll show you where it is. [He marks the city's location on your Pip-Boy map.] You should go there. Right now, if possible. May God lead your steps.}

#{2852}{}{Se-dit. Yeep-yep.}
{2852}{}{编辑。是的，是的。}
#{2900}{}{No, my child. I am sorry, but it doesn't ring a bell.}
{2900}{}{不，我的孩子。我很抱歉，但它不响。}
#{2901}{}{[Wave your hands more.] Did-not-find?!}
{2901}{}{[再挥挥手]没找到？！}
#{2902}{}{Bai then!}
{2902}{}{那就拜！}
