### {205}{}{Really?}
{205}{}{真正地}

### {213}{}{Great. For now, I will assume that we are on the same side.}
{213}{}{太棒了现在，我认为我们站在同一边。}
### {214}{}{Okay. What's going on here?}
{214}{}{可以这是怎么回事？}
### {215}{}{Not really.}

{233}{}{我会告诉你的。仔细听，流浪者的党羽。这些土地不属于你。他们也不属于野蛮人。凤凰城的亚伦拥有整个山谷。回到你的人身边。你也不敢挡我们的路。}

### {263}{}{So why not leave the tribe alone?}
{263}{}{那么，为什么不让部落独处呢？}
### {264}{}{Their brahmins are too valued in Phoenix. Without them, there will be a crisis. Besides, it is unforgivable to leave an enemy under your nose.}
{264}{}{他们的婆罗门在凤凰城太受重视了。没有他们，就会出现危机。此外，把敌人留在你眼皮底下是不可原谅的。}
### {265}{}{[Next]}
{265}{}{[下一个]}
### {266}{}{In any case, I am a subordinate person. I am following the order of the high command. The settlement order is clear to me. And the demands of nomadic illiterate savages are not a decree to me.}

### {267}{}{Clear.}

{271}{}{我得走了。}
### {272}{}{I'll try. I will report on the result.}
{272}{}{我会试试的。我将报告结果。}

### {280}{}{I managed to talk to the chief. But he flatly refuses the union.}
{280}{}{我设法和局长谈过了。但他断然拒绝加入工会。}
### {281}{}{Geronimo is too stubborn. It looks like I'm wasting time with him. We need to act more decisively.}
{281}{}{Geronimo太固执了。看起来我在浪费时间和他在一起。我们需要采取更果断的行动。}
### {282}{}{What's your plan?}
{282}{}{你的计划是什么？}
### {283}{}{I know that not all savages despise us. The young are even trying to help. Among them is the chief's son, Chatto. Talk to him, find out what he wants. If he takes his father's place, then we can come to an agreement.}
{283}{}{我知道并不是所有的野蛮人都鄙视我们。年轻人甚至试图帮助我们。其中包括酋长的儿子查托。和他谈谈，了解他想要什么。如果他接替他父亲的位置，那么我们可以达成协议。}

{1285}{}{我杀了杰罗尼莫和他的继任者查特。}
### {286}{}{It was very reckless! Geronimo resisted the union. But Chatto could have mediated in his place. Now we have no one to negotiate with. The tribe will scatter across the desert, breaking up into small flocks again.}
{286}{}{这太鲁莽了！杰罗尼莫抵制工会。但查特本可以替他调停的。现在我们没有人可以谈判了。部落将分散在沙漠中，再次分成小群。}
### {287}{}{It was hard to foresee...}
{287}{}{很难预见。。。}
### {288}{}{But you wanted to get rid of the leader yourself.}
{288}{}{但你想自己摆脱领导。}
### {289}{}{In any case, the situation has become easier. We will settle in the pueblo and force the savages to accept our rules by force. They won't be able to resist an entire colony.}
{289}{}{无论如何，情况已经变得更容易了。我们将在普韦布洛定居，并通过武力迫使野蛮人接受我们的规则。他们将无法抵抗整个殖民地。}
### {290}{}{Well, can I congratulate you on your victory?}
{290}{}{我可以祝贺你的胜利吗？}
### {291}{}{Not yet. The scouts found out who was raising dust in this pueblo. It turned out to be a man named Oscar. Ranger! Now I understand how the locals know the basics of tactics and guerrilla tricks.}
{291}{}{还没有。侦察兵发现是谁在这个普韦布洛掀起了一片尘土。原来是一个叫奥斯卡的人。护林员现在，我明白了当地人是如何掌握战术和游击队技巧的。}
### {292}{}{[Next]}
{292}{}{[下一个]}
### {293}{}{The Ranger must be driven out of the pueblo! So that they don't even remember his name here. And if he does not want to leave, we will whip him like a stubborn brahmin.}
{293}{}{游骑兵必须被赶出普韦布洛！以至于他们在这里都不记得他的名字了。如果他不想离开，我们会像一个固执的婆罗门一样鞭打他。}
### {294}{}{Good. I'll see what I can do.}
{294}{}{好的我看看我能做些什么。}
### {295}{}{Chatto is now the chief of the tribe. And he agrees to the conclusion of the union.}
{295}{}{查特现在是部落首领。他同意工会的结束。}
### {296}{}{The beauty of the news! Chatto has power in the eyes of the rest of the tribe, his authority will not allow the tribe to scatter in the desert. Very good job. You made a great diplomat. }
{296}{}{新闻之美！查特在部落其他人眼中拥有权力，他的权威不会允许部落分散在沙漠中。做得很好。你做了一个伟大的外交官。}
### {297}{}{The leader agrees to the alliance. I managed to convince him, although it was not easy.}
{297}{}{首领同意结盟。我设法说服了他，尽管这并不容易。}
### {298}{}{The beauty of the news. I don't think he's changed his views that much. Most likely, he was pressured by the other elders who are afraid of war. But it's a good job. You've made a great diplomat.}
{298}{}{新闻之美。我不认为他改变了那么多看法。最有可能的是，他受到了其他害怕战争的长辈的压力。但这是一份不错的工作。你已成为一位伟大的外交家。}

### {300}{}{Oscar is dead. His minions also kneel before you, Commander.}
{300}{}{奥斯卡死了。他的小黄人也跪在你面前，指挥官。}

{327}{}{你们都是从哪里来的？}
### {328}{}{We came from Phoenix to establish a colony here. But this place has already been occupied by savages.}
{328}{}{我们从凤凰城来到这里建立殖民地。但是这个地方已经被野蛮人占领了。}
### {329}{}{And where is this Phoenix?}
{329}{}{这只凤凰在哪里？}
### {330}{}{The city is southeast of here. But it's strange that you don't know that. It seems to be the largest city for miles around.}
{330}{}{这个城市在这里的东南部。但奇怪的是，你不知道这一点。它似乎是方圆数英里内最大的城市。}
### {331}{}{I don't know. I'm actually from a village in the opposite direction.}
{331}{}{我不知道。事实上，我来自相反方向的一个村庄。}
### {332}{}{Then it's clear. These are Ranger lands. It is not surprising that there are only villages in your area and no civilization. Take a look at Phoenix, see what a normal city is.}
{332}{}{那就清楚了。这些是游骑兵的领地。你所在的地区只有村庄，没有文明，这并不奇怪。看看凤凰城，看看什么是一个正常的城市。}

### {340}{}{Go on.}
{340}{}{继续}
### {341}{}{Some radical clans even attack civilians. Phoenix has been trying to negotiate peace for several years. And some clans even went over to our side. But not all of them. Now my squad also felt the stubbornness of the savages on their own skin. }
{341}{}{一些激进的部族甚至攻击平民。菲尼克斯几年来一直在努力进行和平谈判。甚至有几个家族来到我们这边。但并不是所有的。现在，我的小队也感受到了野蛮人的固执。}
### {342}{}{Now I understand why you are so bristling with weapons. Peace to you. And I have to go.}

### {352}{}{Well, you don't want to anger the tribe, right?}

{359}{}{部落已准备好采取果断行动。你的出现只会给他们一个理由。}
### {360}{}{I know that savages will not give up so easily. They are too far from the ideal of the New World that my lord is building. But that is why my mission is so important - to show the savages that they live in an outdated and incorrect way. Show that there is a better world.}
{360}{}{我知道野蛮人不会轻易放弃的。他们离我的领主正在建设的新世界的理想太远了。但这就是为什么我的使命如此重要――向野蛮人展示他们以过时和不正确的方式生活。表明世界更美好。}
### {361}{}{Okay. I won't argue.}
{361}{}{可以我不会争辩的。}
### {362}{}{However, angering them will only scare the tribe away from their ideals. Give them time to think. In the end, your mission will end in nothing if they attack.}
{362}{}{然而，激怒他们只会让部落远离他们的理想。给他们思考的时间。最终，如果他们发动攻击，你的任务将一无所获。}
### {363}{}{Thousands of savages! I'm already thinking about returning to Phoenix myself. My people are tired, there are not enough supplies for everyone, and then there are savages watching from behind a dune.}
{363}{}{成千上万的野蛮人！我已经在考虑自己回凤凰城了。我的人民很累，没有足够的物资给每个人，然后有野蛮人在沙丘后面看着。}
### {364}{}{So what have you decided?}
{364}{}{那么你决定了什么？}
### {365}{}{Okay. We'll leave. But only to return with renewed vigor.}
{365}{}{可以我们会离开的。但只是带着新的活力回来了。}
