{2352}{}{我现在什么都不提供。}
#{2353}{}{Ugh.}

#{2401}{}{Eh.}
{2401}{}{嗯。}
#{2420}{}{That decision took you a fucking long time. If you're a prick like this all the time, I doubt I'll earn any dough with you. [Looks at you observantly.] Now I don't think you have what it takes. Try another time, I might be in a better mood. If I'm still here.}
{2420}{}{那个决定花了你很长时间。如果你一直是这样的混蛋，我怀疑我能和你一起挣点钱。[仔细地看着你]现在我想你已经不具备了。换个时间试试，我的心情可能会好些。如果我还在这里。}

#{2852}{}{Just come on and don't talk about it.}
{2852}{}{来吧，别再说了。}
#{2900}{}{Screw you. I'm not making any serious dough while you act like a whuss. I might as well waste my time in Rodriguez's casino some more.}
{2900}{}{去你的。当你表现得像个白痴的时候，我可没发什么大财。我还不如再在罗德里格斯的赌场里浪费点时间。}
#{2901}{}{Screw you. I'm not making any serious dough while you act like a whuss. I might as well waste my time in Rodriguez's casino some more.}
{2901}{}{去你的。当你表现得像个白痴的时候，我可没发什么大财。我还不如再在罗德里格斯的赌场里浪费点时间。}

#{3051}{}{You'll see.}
{3051}{}{你会看到的。}

#{3500}{}{First of all, get it through your thick skull that I won't change leather armor for anything weaker. And I'm not taking off my armor if it isn't fucking necessary. Not even when I'm having fun with a hooker. Maybe if we need to disguise ourselves, I might be willing to put a robe on, but when comes to a fight I'd rather wear something that can stop a fucking bullet.}
{3500}{}{首先，通过你的厚头骨，我不会改变任何较弱的皮革盔甲。如果没必要的话我也不会脱下盔甲。即使我和一个妓女玩得开心也不行。也许如果我们需要伪装自己，我可能愿意穿上长袍，但在战斗中，我宁愿穿能挡住子弹的衣服。}
#{3501}{}{OK, got it.}
{3501}{}{好的，明白了。}
#{3520}{}{Get it through your thick skull that I won't change leather armor for anything weaker. And I'm not taking off my armor if it isn't fucking necessary.

#{3750}{}{Town crowded with fucking cops. You can't even spit without hitting one of those motherfuckers. I don't visit Sedit unless necessary. On the other hand, Lost Town is a kind of crazy opposite. It's a place when a man can breath, even with all those Mexicans pretending to be gangsters.}
{3750}{}{镇上挤满了该死的警察。你连吐口水都不能不打那些混蛋。除非有必要，否则我不会去看塞迪特。另一方面，《迷失之城》是一个疯狂的反面。这是一个男人可以呼吸的地方，即使那些墨西哥人都假装是歹徒。}

{3751}{}{我需要你给我点别的东西。}
#{3752}{}{Thanks for the info.}
{3752}{}{谢谢你的信息。}
#{3800}{}{What I see is enough. Retarded farmers who spend their worthless lives digging in dirt and taking care of mangy cattle. They don't even have enough fucking courage to protect the shit they own. They make me sick.}
{3800}{}{我看到的就够了。弱智的农民，他们用他们毫无价值的生命在泥土中挖掘和照顾肮脏的牛。他们甚至没有足够的勇气去保护自己的狗屎。他们让我恶心。}

#{3802}{}{Thanks for the info.}

{3851}{}{我需要你给我点别的东西。}
#{3852}{}{Thanks for the info.}
{3852}{}{谢谢你的信息。}
#{3900}{}{Just what rumors float around. Supposedly, there are two bastards wanting to conquer the town so they try to cap each other. Being scared shitless from local cops, they won't fight openly. It's a situation in which we can get a fucking nice job. And if both of them are too careful, a few dead cops on the streets can get things moving.}
{3900}{}{只是流言蜚语。据说，有两个混蛋想征服这个城市，所以他们试图互相封杀。被当地警察吓得屁滚尿流，他们不会公开打架。在这种情况下我们可以找到一份他妈的好工作。如果他们两个都太小心的话，街上几个死去的警察就能把事情搞定。}
#{3901}{}{Shit, I know everything I need. We're not getting another real job here anymore. Staying in this pisshole is a fucking waste of time.}

{4000}{}{死区到处都是他妈的瘾君子，下一个区到处都是他妈的变种猎人，郊区到处都是狗屎。至少在人群中消失是个好地方。还有一个帝国城市，到处都是坐在屁股上的混蛋，过着奢侈的生活，几乎不让任何人接近他们。}

#{4002}{}{Thanks for the info.}

#{4052}{}{Thanks for the info.}
{4052}{}{谢谢你的信息。}

#{4300}{}{A guy named Eddie, a miserable gambler, took a fancy to one of Rodriguez's women. Rodriguez is very jealous with them; some guys have lost both eyes just for one fucking glance. Well, Eddie went straight to fucking her and that idiot was even trying to convince her to flee with him. Only she was too scared shitless of Rodriguez to run away, so when the shit hit the fan, dear Eddie had to make himself disappear. I was hired to make sure he doesn't stay disappeared forever.}
{4300}{}{一个叫埃迪的家伙，一个可怜的赌徒，看上了罗德里格斯的一个女人。罗德里格斯对他们非常嫉妒；有些人仅仅他妈的一眼就失去了双眼。嗯，埃迪直接去和她上床，那个白痴甚至试图说服她和他一起逃跑。只是她太害怕罗德里格斯了，所以当他妈的东西砸到风扇上时，亲爱的埃迪不得不让他自己消失。我被雇来是为了确保他不会永远消失。}
#{4301}{}{How did it go?}
{4301}{}{进展如何？}
#{4350}{}{That cunt babbled out everything she knew just before Rodriguez killed her personally. Moreover, Eddie was a pathetic coward. Finding him was a piece of a fucking cake. He got hired as a caravan guard but when they were attacked, he fled after the first few shots. He continued alone, not really knowing where he was heading. When I found him, he was bitten by rats and already dying from thirst. To complicate things, Rodriguez wanted him alive so I had to listen to all his petty whining, pleas and attempts to bribe me whenever he had an opportunity to talk. That asshole was so annoying that I would've shot him immediately, if the reward hadn't been so high.}
{4350}{}{就在罗德里格斯亲手杀了她之前，那个贱人胡言乱语地说出了她所知道的一切。而且，埃迪是个可悲的懦夫。找到他真是小菜一碟。他被雇为商队警卫，但当他们遭到袭击时，他在最初几枪后逃跑了。他继续独自一人，不知道自己要去哪里。当我找到他的时候，他被老鼠咬了，已经渴死了。更复杂的是，罗德里格斯想要他活着，所以每当他有机会说话的时候，我就不得不听他所有的抱怨、恳求和贿赂我的企图。那混蛋真烦人，要不是悬赏这么高，我早就开枪了。}
#{4351}{}{What happened to Eddie?}
{4351}{}{埃迪怎么了？}
#{4400}{}{What do you think? Rodriguez prepared some hellish agony that people can only imagine, before finally killing him. I heard something about burning his balls but that wasn't my concern anymore. I was glad I had my caps and I knew I wouldn't be seeing that idiot again... Rodriguez always cared about discretion but I can tell you this, because it soon became a rumor anyway. Most locals know the story but they keep their mouths shut. Rodriguez's guys like to shoot blabbers like that right away.}
{4400}{}{你怎么认为？罗德里格斯准备了一些人们只能想象的地狱般的痛苦，最后才杀了他。我听说有人烧了他的蛋蛋，但那不再是我的问题了。我很高兴我有瓶盖，我知道我不会再见到那个白痴了。。。罗德里格斯一直很在乎谨慎，但我可以告诉你，因为这很快就成了谣言。大多数当地人都知道这个故事，但他们闭口不谈。罗德里格斯的人喜欢马上开枪打那些喋喋不休的人。}

They had to've became really fond of him, because they decided to keep drinking with him at their place. When that asshole woke up in the morning probably with no memory of previous night, he must've been quite disturbed finding himself in the secret raider lair. So he disappeared. Hard to say how he managed to do that. Damian was pissed they compromised the lair's secrecy and didn't bother asking for any excuses; he went right to burning out some of his dickheads' eyes and so on. When comes to shit like that, Damian is a fucking bastard. Well, my job was to find that poor asshole and end him. It didn't take me much time to find out where in Sedit he lives and cut his throat on the street during night.}
{5200}{}{这是个他妈的好故事，你会喜欢的。这一切都是从一些袭击者在赌场喝醉开始的。他们和一些条件相同的笨蛋成了朋友。他们一定很喜欢他，因为他们决定继续和他在家里喝酒。当那个混蛋早上醒来时，可能对前一天晚上没有任何记忆，他一定很不安地发现自己在秘密的突袭者巢穴里。所以他消失了。很难说他是怎么做到的。达米安很生气，因为他们泄露了巢穴的秘密，也懒得找任何借口；他直接烧掉了一些白痴的眼睛等等。说到那样的事，达米安是个混蛋。好吧，我的工作就是找到那个可怜的混蛋然后干掉他。我没花多少时间就找到了他在塞迪特的住处，晚上在街上割破了他的喉咙。}

#{5250}{}{That isn't my problem. Damian hired me to get rid of that asshole, not to get that fucking piece of information.

#{5450}{}{They left the whole caravan alone just to get you. They wanted to kill you really bad but nobody had put out a hit on you. It would have to be a fucking tempting reward, every dickhead would know about it.}
{5450}{}{他们把整个商队都留下来只是为了抓你。他们真的很想杀了你，但没人打你。这一定是一个他妈的诱人的奖励，每个白痴都会知道的。}

{5700}{}{那个小瘾君子对周围的人来说都是累赘。那又怎样，你要为此负责？在他给你带来麻烦或抢劫你之前，别浪费时间和他在一起。如果我发现他从我这里拿走了一顶该死的瓶盖，他临死前经历的最后一件事就是把他的脏爪子压碎。}

She was clever enough to disappear in time.}

#{5903}{}{That's all I wanted to hear.}
{5903}{}{我只想听这些。}
#{5950}{}{I've been to Corath once. Around that short time when caravans were making fucking long jurneys between the Hub and Sedit. In the Hub, I took a stupid offer from an honorable local fella named Butch. He was in charge of a caravan company trying to get greater influence in the town's leadership. By chance, one of his employees discovered some dirt on him. Butch wasn't satisfied with the fucker leaving the town so he offered me a fucking huge reward for his eternal silence. With an amount that big for such an ordinary fucker, I should've suspected something.}
{5950}{}{我去过科拉斯一次。在那短暂的一段时间里，商队在中心和赛迪特之间做着他妈的长长的陪审团。在中心，我接受了一个叫布奇的当地人的愚蠢提议。他负责一家商队公司，试图在镇上的领导层中获得更大的影响力。一次偶然的机会，他的一个雇员发现了他身上的一些污垢。布奇不满意那个混蛋离开这个镇，所以他给了我一个他妈的巨额奖励，让我永远保持沉默。对于这样一个普通的混蛋来说，这么多钱，我应该有所怀疑。}
#{5951}{}{What was the catch?}
{5951}{}{抓的是什么？}
#{6000}{}{That fucker disappeared faster then all a junkie's savings. I searched for him for several months until I found him in Corath where he worked as a miner. I took the job as well so I could get close to him, but it was no good. Nestor has a bunch of armed men keeping a fucking close eye on the miners. It was impossible to smuggle a gun in and that bastard never went anywhere outside. Any stupid dispute between miners is always quickly taken care of by guards by shooting the one who started it. There are dozens of troublemakers buried in the mine and the fucking police know nothing about them.}
{6000}{}{那混蛋消失得比瘾君子的积蓄还快。我找了他好几个月，直到在科拉斯找到他，他在那里当矿工。我也接受了这份工作，这样我就可以接近他，但那不好。内斯特有一帮武装人员在密切监视矿工。把枪偷偷带进来是不可能的，那个混蛋从没有到过外面的任何地方。矿工之间任何愚蠢的争执都会很快被守卫们处理好，他们会开枪打死挑起争端的人。矿井里埋着几十个捣乱者，该死的警察对他们一无所知。}
#{6001}{}{So what did you do?}
{6001}{}{你做了什么？}
#{6050}{}{For a few lousy caps, I got some advice from one engineer on how to damage a generator so it would explode in a few minutes. In the right moment I used that new knowledge on the right generator. The explosion caused a mine collapse which killed 12 people, including my fucking target. Before I left, I shot that engineer as well to keep him from ratting on me. It looked like he killed himself, feeling responsible for the explosion. Can you imagine how fucking pissed I was when I found out that motherfucking Butch got himself killed while defending the Hub? The whole fucking reward was lost.}
{6050}{}{对于一些糟糕的瓶盖，我从一个工程师那里得到了一些关于如何损坏发电机的建议，使它在几分钟内爆炸。在正确的时刻，我把新知识用在了正确的发电机上。爆炸造成了一个矿井坍塌，造成12人死亡，包括我的目标。在我离开之前，我还开枪打死了那个工程师，以免他背叛我。看起来他自杀了，觉得对爆炸负有责任。你能想象当我发现那个该死的布奇在保卫中心时自杀时我有多生气吗？他妈的报酬全丢了。}

{6100}{}{我不明白你为什么要花钱把你的老二放在一个臭烘烘的双头牛里，而这个双头牛却被周围所有肮脏的矿工搞得一团糟。当你没有足够的钱买一个真正的妓女的时候，你最好快滚。但这不关我的事，我不想知道你为什么这么享受。}

#{7050}{}{It's a stupid story. I was hired to kill Roger, mayor of Los Alamos. You don't need to concern yourself with who ordered the hit. I screwed it up bad. Roger had more guys than I expected. I ended up in a fucking shootout. I was lucky though, I managed to get my ass away with only two bullets inside me. I traveled to Albuquerque, where I spent every last cap I had on those vultures in the hospital to get me back on my feet.}

#{7051}{}{What does it have to do with Vex?}
{7051}{}{这和Vex有什么关系？}
#{7100}{}{I was employed by Vex for about a year after that. I needed money and Albuquerque was a good place to get lost, should that asshole Roger start looking for me.

I was fucking surprised when suddenly Roger appeared in the Suburbs. It was said that Los Alamos was leveled by ghouls and that bastard sacrificed most of his people to escape alive with his fucking family.}
{7100}{}{在那之后，我被Vex公司雇用了大约一年。我需要钱，如果那个混蛋罗杰开始找我的话，阿尔伯克基是个迷路的好地方。威胁他妈的胆小鬼和弱智野蛮人真是糟透了。即使和最强壮的人在一起，我通常也会做一些手臂骨折的事。当罗杰突然出现在郊区时，我他妈的很惊讶。据说洛斯阿拉莫斯被僵尸夷为平地，那个混蛋为了和他妈的家人一起活着逃跑牺牲了大部分人。}
#{7101}{}{What did you do?}
{7101}{}{你做了什么？}
#{7150}{}{I took a bunch of Vex's guys to eliminate the rest of Roger's guards. Ultimately, five of Vex's guys and Roger's wife were acceptable losses. I had that son of a bitch and his three brats. I made him watch while I skinned them alive. Torturing little brats doesn't bring me any special joy, but after a year in the Suburbs I fucking needed to lift my mood. I just had to see the expression on his face when he watched how they suffered. After five days, he begged me to kill him just so he didn't have to watch it anymore. So I did. I then took all the caps that bastard was able to carry from Los Alamos and left Albuquerque to claim a year old reward.}
{7150}{}{我带了一帮维克斯的人去消灭罗杰的其他警卫。最终，维克斯的五个手下和罗杰的妻子都是可以接受的损失。我有那个狗娘养的和他的三个孩子。我让他看着我活剥他们的皮。折磨小家伙并没有给我带来什么特别的快乐，但在郊区呆了一年后，我他妈的需要提升我的情绪。我只想看看他看着他们受苦时脸上的表情。五天后，他求我杀了他，这样他就不用再看了。所以我做了。然后我拿走了那个混蛋从洛斯阿拉莫斯带回来的所有瓶盖，离开阿尔伯克基去领取一年前的奖励。}

#{8900}{}{I must admit that you solved the problem with those stupid prisoners nicely. By persuading that fucker to terminate them, you managed to get rid of him and you also granted the prisoners a quick death. You are one devious motherfucker.}
{8900}{}{我必须承认你很好地解决了那些愚蠢的囚犯的问题。通过劝说那个混蛋终止他们的关系，你成功地除掉了他，你还批准了囚犯的快速死亡。你是个狡猾的混蛋。}

#{8903}{}{But I didn't want him to kill them.}
{8903}{}{但我不想他杀了他们。}
#{8904}{}{I'll take that as a compliment.}
{8904}{}{我认为这是一种恭维。}
#{8950}{}{You can feed that crap to someone who'll care and believe you. I've seen that beautiful masterpiece of yours. You aren't as stupid as you seem.}
{8950}{}{你可以把那些垃圾给关心你和相信你的人。我看过你那幅美丽的杰作。你不像你看起来那么愚蠢。}

#{9000}{}{Hunters employ all kinds of morons who think they can save the world. It's no wonder one of them could break loose from the leash. I bet it's the last thing those bastards want to be spreading across Albuquerque. They could pay some serious caps for keeping our mouths shut.}
{9000}{}{猎人雇佣各种各样认为自己能拯救世界的白痴。难怪其中一个会挣脱皮带。我敢打赌这是那些混蛋最不想在阿尔伯克基传播的东西。他们会为我们的闭嘴付出代价的。}
#{9001}{}{We'll see about that, but now let's get out of here.}
{9001}{}{我们拭目以待，但现在让我们离开这里。}
#{9002}{}{We'll see about that, but now we still have to blow up the base.}

#{9050}{}{I've never seen better range and penetration in a rifle in my whole life. This weapon isn't just for killing. It's one to kill for as well. Don't give it back to the moldies. We should try beating more ammo out of that retarded technician instead.}
{9050}{}{我这辈子从没见过比这更好的步枪射程和穿透力。这种武器不只是用来杀人的。这也是杀人的原因之一。别把它还给霉了。我们应该试着从那个迟钝的技术人员身上打更多的子弹。}
#{9051}{}{I have some other questions.}
{9051}{}{我还有一些问题。}
#{9052}{}{That's all I wanted to hear.}
{9052}{}{我只想听这些。}
#{9100}{}{Well, aren't you one tough motherfucker. When it collapsed behind you, I thought you were dead for sure. I just went around to look for another entrance, just out of curiosity, and here you are. That's fucking awesome. Have you found anything valuable?}
{9100}{}{好吧，你不是个坚强的混蛋。当它倒在你身后时，我以为你肯定死了。我只是好奇地四处寻找另一个入口，给你。太棒了。你找到有价值的东西了吗？}

#{9102}{}{Nothing valuable if you don't count an aggressive deathclaw. I'm fine by the way, thanks for asking.}
{9102}{}{如果你不算一只凶猛的死爪，就没有什么价值了。顺便说一下，我很好，谢谢你的邀请。}
#{9103}{}{Deathclawie there! Gabraa!}
{9103}{}{死爪在那里！加布拉！}
#{9150}{}{Stop freaking out because of one stupid deathclaw. Let's get out of here, we aren't gonna earn anything in this shithole.}

#{9151}{}{Yeah, let's get out of here.}
{9151}{}{是啊，我们走吧。}

#{9204}{}{Gabraa live!}
{9204}{}{加布拉现场！}
#{9250}{}{What is it? Did you really think I was going to wait for you in one place forever like some moron? If you've stopped acting like a prick, I'm willing to travel with you again.}
{9250}{}{它是什么？你真以为我会像个白痴一样永远在一个地方等你吗？如果你不再像个混蛋，我愿意再和你一起旅行。}
#{9251}{}{What is it? Did you really think I was going to wait for you in one place forever like some moron? If you've stopped acting like a bitch, I'm willing to travel with you again.}

{9254}{}{格里尔。}
#{9300}{}{What is it? Did you really think I was going to wait for you in one place forever like some moron? You act like a prick anyway, screw you. I'm going to go get some action that will earn me serious caps. I won't have that with you.}
{9300}{}{它是什么？你真以为我会像个白痴一样永远在一个地方等你吗？不管怎样，你表现得像个混蛋，去你的。我要去做些能给我带来好成绩的事。我不会和你在一起的。}

{9302}{}{随便你，去死吧。}

{10009}{}{在你的梦里！}
#{10010}{}{Tell me, Keri, when you were fighting for the Hub, were you among those pussies that ran away instantly or did you stay long enough to shit your pants after first retarded supermutant appeared?}
{10010}{}{告诉我，克里，当你为中心而战的时候，你是在那些立刻跑掉的女人中，还是在第一个弱智的超级毛驴出现后，你呆了足够长的时间去拉屎？}
#{10011}{}{I don't want to talk about the Hub. Least of all with you!}
{10011}{}{我不想谈论中心。尤其是你！}
#{10012}{}{You won't admit that you ran away like a mangy pig chased by a dog. Fucking supermutants were about to arrive and you ran away with the other fucking cowards. You didn't have the guts to stay and fight.}
{10012}{}{你不会承认你像一只被狗追赶的脏猪一样跑了。他妈的超级毛驴就要来了，你却和其他他妈的胆小鬼跑了。你没有勇气留下来战斗。}
#{10013}{}{For your information, I was fighting supermutants until it was absolutely hopeless. When there wasn't anything to stop them anymore, I was barely able to drag my father away. That fucker was willing to die there.}
{10013}{}{告诉你，我一直在和超级变种人战斗，直到完全没有希望。当再也没有什么能阻止他们的时候，我几乎没法把父亲拖走。那个混蛋愿意死在那里。}
#{10014}{}{Well, there's something in you after all. You aren't just a stupid bitch.}
{10014}{}{好吧，你身上毕竟有些东西。你不只是个愚蠢的婊子。}
