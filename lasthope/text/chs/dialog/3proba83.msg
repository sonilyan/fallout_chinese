### {106}{}{Yeah, what the hell do you want?}
{106}{}{是的，你到底想要什么？}
### {107}{}{What can you tell me about your organization?}
{107}{}{你能告诉我关于你的组织的什么？}
### {108}{}{I want to buy some... servants?}
{108}{}{我想买一些。。。仆人？}
### {109}{}{Nothing, I'm out of here.}
{109}{}{没什么，我要离开这里。}
### {110}{}{I would call it an association of free lancers. Most of us were criminals of some sort, brought together only by a sense for profit, nothing more. Our daily routine begins with the hunting down of these savages all across the wasteland. My customers are always looking for new servants and workers, so business is flourishing... except for that crabgrass called mayor Donson. That bastard keeps raising taxes every time I ask for a favor... This is fucking annoying because might as well declare a fucking bankruptcy!}
{110}{}{我称之为自由职业者协会。我们中的大多数人都是某种罪犯，仅仅是为了盈利而聚集在一起。我们的日常生活始于在荒原上追捕这些野蛮人。我的客户总是在寻找新的仆人和工人，所以生意兴隆。。。除了那个叫唐森市长的螃蟹。每次我请求帮助，那个混蛋就不断加税。。。这他妈的很烦人，因为还不如宣布他妈的破产！}
### {111}{}{I heard you, let me as you something else.}
{111}{}{我听到了，让我为你做点别的吧。}
### {112}{}{No offense man but I don't think you can afford any of these servants. They are well trained... well, you have to whip them a bit [smiles] but once they get to know who's the boss, they won't give you no more human rights bullshit. Tell you what, when I meet demands from my top priority customers then you can check out the rest of my stock. That's the best I can do given the circumstances.}
{112}{}{无意冒犯，但我认为你负担不起这些仆人。他们受过良好的训练。。。好吧，你必须鞭策他们一点[微笑]，但一旦他们知道谁是老板，他们就不会再给你人权废话了。告诉你，当我满足我的首要客户的需求时，你可以查看我的剩余库存。考虑到目前的情况，这是我能做的最好的事情。}
### {113}{}{Alright then.}
{113}{}{好吧。}
### {114}{}{What the hell do you want this time?}
{114}{}{这次你到底想要什么？}
### {115}{}{Did you put on the fucking ear plugs last time we spoke? [Grunts.] Uh... nevermind. I sell hard working servants, well trained and obedient. For a fair price you get only high quality, nothing less.}
{115}{}{上次我们说话时你他妈的戴上耳塞了吗？呃。。。没关系。我卖辛勤工作、训练有素、听话的仆人。只要价格合理，你就能得到高质量的产品。}
### {116}{}{I heard you, let me ask you something else.}
{116}{}{我听到了，让我再问你一件事。}
### {117}{}{I'm in a hurry, so don't bother me with your thinking. Say what you want!}
{117}{}{我赶时间，所以别用你的想法打扰我。想说什么就说什么！}
### {118}{}{I'd like to make some money, maybe work for you?}
{118}{}{我想挣点钱，也许为你工作？}
### {119}{}{I'd like to make some money, do you know how pathetic that sounds!? And who the fuck are you to want something from me? In fact, I'm not selling anything to you wanna be popular bone head and I don't require guards, so get lost scumbag!}
{119}{}{我想赚点钱，你知道这听起来有多可悲吗！？你他妈的是谁想从我这里得到什么？事实上，我不卖任何东西给你想成为受欢迎的骨头头，我不需要警卫，所以迷路的卑鄙小人！}
### {120}{}{Right, let me ask you something else.}
{120}{}{好吧，让我再问你一件事。}
### {121}{}{I'm out of this awful place.}
{121}{}{我离开了这个糟糕的地方。}
### {122}{}{So you want to join!? Never thought someone with your reputation would like to join us from the other side of the law. If you still think you are good enough, let me ask you something first. Do you really think I'm just going to let anyone stick his nose into our business!? }
{122}{}{所以你想加入！？从没想过像你这样有名望的人会从法律的另一边加入我们。如果你仍然认为自己足够优秀，让我先问你一些问题。你真的认为我会让任何人插手我们的生意吗！？}
### {123}{}{Well... I guess not, but I'd like to prove myself.}
{123}{}{好我想不会，但我想证明自己。}
### {124}{}{Forget it. I'm out of here.}
{124}{}{算了，我要离开这里。}
### {125}{}{You're damn right! Until you prove yourself to be trust worthy, you'll get your hands dirty, no excuses! One more thing, if you mess up something or I hear you talking shit to anyone else I will kill you, got it?! Alright now, let's get started. You need to head south to a small place called Silting...}
{125}{}{你说得对！除非你证明自己值得信任，否则你会弄脏你的手，没有任何借口！还有一件事，如果你搞砸了什么，或者我听到你和其他人说脏话，我会杀了你，明白吗？！好了，现在让我们开始吧。你需要向南去一个叫“淤积”的小地方。。。}
### {126}{}{Go on...}
{126}{}{继续}
### {127}{}{My sources told me they run some kind of trading business, but it's all a great fucking cover up. During the night they shift large amounts of weapon boxes in and out of the heavily guarded cave entrance. Now, one must be very stupid not to figure this is where they keep all those goods. So I want to know what else they have inside that fortress, and more important, is it for sale. Because that's our damn way in! If they won't let you see the stock then fucking do whatever you can and find out anything about their doings. Just don't get yourself into trouble or you'll be sorry! Go now.}
{127}{}{我的消息来源告诉我，他们经营着某种交易业务，但这一切都是他妈的掩盖。夜间，他们在戒备森严的洞穴入口处转移大量武器箱。现在，人们一定很愚蠢，没有想到这是他们存放所有货物的地方。所以我想知道他们在堡垒里还有什么，更重要的是，它是待售的。因为那是我们该死的进去的路！如果他们不让你看到股票，那就他妈的尽你所能，找出他们的所作所为。别惹麻烦，否则你会后悔的！现在就去。}
### {128}{}{[Leave.]}
{128}{}{[离开]}
### {129}{}{About that job...}
{129}{}{关于那份工作。。。}
### {130}{}{What are you doing here?! I don't want to see your face in this room again without any information. You got it, stupid fuck!?}
{130}{}{你在这里干什么？！如果没有任何信息，我不想再在这个房间里看到你的脸。你明白了，他妈的！？}
### {131}{}{Sorry.}
{131}{}{很抱歉}
### {132}{}{I've had enough of you. Time to die, slaver scum!}
{132}{}{我受够了你。该死了，奴隶贩子渣滓！}
### {133}{}{What is it? Speak!}
{133}{}{它是什么？谈}
### {135}{}{Still working on it.}
{135}{}{还在努力。}
### {136}{}{I have the information you need, this account book. It's all here...}
{136}{}{我有你需要的资料，这本账簿。都在这里。。。}
### {137}{}{This is very good, you earned yourself a little bonus. So I'll give you $2500 instead of $2450... That's what I call a little bonus! Hahaha! Now get lost!}
{137}{}{这很好，你为自己赢得了一点奖金。所以我会给你2500美元，而不是2450美元…这就是我所说的小奖金！哈哈哈！现在迷路！}
### {138}{}{Right.}
{138}{}{正确的}
### {139}{}{I demand a raise right now!}
{139}{}{我现在就要求加薪！}
### {140}{}{So you want to join us!? Why would I let some rat-head who despises slavery join us? Words about your involvement in that Valley-something traveled fast. On the other hand... that bastard was our competition, so you actually did us a favor.}
{140}{}{所以你想加入我们！？我为什么要让一个蔑视奴隶制的老鼠头加入我们？关于你参与那个山谷的消息传得很快。另一方面那个混蛋是我们的对手，所以你实际上帮了我们一个忙。}
### {141}{}{So that's a good thing, right?}
{141}{}{所以这是一件好事，对吧？}
### {142}{}{I can get things done, ask anyone.}
{142}{}{我可以把事情做完，问任何人。}
### {143}{}{I have their transactions list, here...}
{143}{}{我有他们的交易清单，在这里。。。}
