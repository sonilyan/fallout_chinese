### {101}{}{Hello there, kid. Haven't seen strangers for years. But can't really talk right now, I'm in a big hurry. My damn plow broke down, then my shovel went missing, and now I'm not gonna finish my gardening on time. I can barely walk and now this... Ugh. Hey, kid... [Looking at you.] Wanna help an old fella?}
{101}{}{你好，孩子。多年没见过陌生人了。但我现在真的不能说话，我很着急。我那该死的犁坏了，然后我的铲子不见了，现在我不能按时完成园艺了。我几乎不能走路，现在。。。啊。嘿，孩子。。。[看着你。]想帮助一个老家伙吗？ -- Hello there, kid. Haven't seen strangers for years.

[sighs] and there's no way for me to survive without my harvest. It's all I got. So listen, kid, I need a shovel, any kind will do just fine. If you find one or buy me a new one, I will be forever grateful. I really don't have any money to pay for it, but if it means something to you I could give you some food or something to drink because it's all I got and all I ever needed.}
{104}{}{好吧，我的这些老腿再也不能让我站起来走动了。我可以在我的领域工作，多年的努力让我习惯了这一点，但其他任何事情。。。没有收获，我就无法生存。这就是我的全部。听着，孩子，我需要一把铲子，任何一种都可以。如果你找到一个或给我买一个新的，我将永远感激你。我真的没有钱支付，但如果这对你有意义，我可以给你一些食物或饮料，因为这是我所拥有的，也是我所需要的。 -- Well, these old legs of mine won't let me stand up and walk around no more.

### {111}{}{You know, sonny, that shovel has really helped me. But I have a problem with my well. The water is pouring out every time I try to take some of it.

I need a new rope and someone to fix the well. Please, I need that water or my plants are gonna get dry and die. Can you find a new rope for me, sonny?}
{111}{}{你知道，孩子，那把铲子真的帮了我。但我的井有问题。每次我试着拿水的时候，水都会倾泻而出。这是水桶，它一团糟。我试着自己修，但我太老了，不能修。更糟糕的是，当我摆弄吊绳时，吊绳解开掉到了井里。现在。。。我需要一根新绳子和一个人来修井。求你了，我需要这些水，否则我的植物就会干枯。你能给我找一根新绳子吗，孩子？ -- You know, sonny, that shovel has really helped me.

### {118}{}{Howdy, sonny! Nice to see you again. Hey, this old fella heard that some flowers could be used to make some powerful healing stuff. If this is really true, I want to try it myself. When I was younger I used to study chemicals and potions. Ooh, the old times... Yeah, there was one time I made an antidote for radscorpion poison! As I remember, I used the very poison from the scorpion's tail. Folks around know that and they are asking me to make some antidote for them... all the time. But I need a larger number of those broc flowers and a sample of radscorpion poison. Could you get me five flowers and about three scorpion tails?}
