### {222}{}{How do you like her training?}
{222}{}{你觉得她的训练怎么样？}
### {223}{}{Very tiring. But it will benefit in the conditions of a hungry desert. It's a shame that we, the cadets, are not allowed to shoot serious weapons. I've been dreaming about him since the very beginning of my studies. And even after receiving the badge, we will have to save ammo. Annoying.}
{223}{}{很累。但在饥饿的沙漠条件下，它会受益。遗憾的是，我们这些学员不被允许发射严重的武器。我从一开始学习就梦想着他。即使收到徽章，我们也必须节省弹药。烦人的}

### {239}{}{We were really going to get the gun back. But the shooting attracted the radscorpions. I had to run, and the gun was left lying in the desert. It is not possible to return for him without arousing suspicion yet. Besides, the quartermaster, as luck would have it, has started reinventarization.}
{239}{}{我们真的要把枪拿回来。但这次枪击吸引了蝎子。我不得不逃跑，而枪却被丢在了沙漠里。回来找他还不可能不引起怀疑。此外，幸运的是，这位四分卫已经开始了重塑。}
### {240}{}{Well, I can understand you. Although others will judge.}

{244}{}{如果你把枪还给我，我会把剩下的子弹给你。我会想办法把它偷偷带回仓库，这样我们的屁股就不会受伤。武器放在农场对面的一个大仙人掌下。你怎么说？}
