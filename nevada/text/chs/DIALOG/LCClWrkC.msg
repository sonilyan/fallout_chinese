#{116}{}{[Simon listens to the story with his mouth open] That son of a bitch! This nigga's too tricky to have the right to live on this planet! And you know what I gonna do now? Oh, no, I'm not going to punch him in the face! He tried to outsmart me, and now I will outsmart him.}
{116}{}{[西蒙张嘴听故事]那个狗娘养的！这个黑鬼太狡猾了，没有权利在这个星球上生活！你知道我现在要做什么吗？哦，不，我不会打他的脸！他想比我聪明，现在我要比他聪明。}
#{117}{}{What do you have in mind?}
{117}{}{你有什么想法？}
#{118}{}{Well, let's say. I need a man who would throw the keys to that nigga's pocket, and then tell about it to that old woman. I'll pay! Of course, I could have done that myself, but, in my case, it is unsafe - can arouse suspicion. And you're a new man, nobody will suspect a thing. Well, what do you say?}
{118}{}{好吧，我们说吧。我需要一个男人把钥匙扔到那个黑鬼的口袋里，然后告诉那个老妇人。我会付钱的！当然，我自己也可以这么做，但在我的情况下，这是不安全的-会引起怀疑。你是个新人，没人会怀疑。你说呢？}

#{123}{}{Sure, you can just leave. All good. But think about it - I would pay good money and, perhaps, could sneak something off the factory for you. What can this old woman and fat nigger offer? I'm not in a hurry. Think about it. When you're ready - act.}
{123}{}{当然，你可以走了。一切都很好。但是想想看，我会付很多钱，也许，我可以帮你从工厂偷点东西。这个老妇人和胖黑鬼能提供什么？我不急。好好想想。当你准备好的时候-表演。}

{126}{}{我们说好的，我告发了那个黑人。现在他被解雇了。}
#{127}{}{It feels damn nice, when people are brilliantly doing their job! Oh yeah... I always keep my word. 250 bucks for this. Of course, this is not the best money in the world, so I can only offer gas protection suit in addition. It can be sold for good money on the market. Believe me, that nigga would not give you more than that.}
{127}{}{当人们出色地完成他们的工作时，感觉真是太好了！哦，是的。。。我总是信守诺言。250块买这个。当然，这不是世界上最好的钱，所以我只能提供额外的气体保护服。它可以在市场上卖到好价钱。相信我，那个黑鬼不会给你更多的。}
#{128}{}{That's right! Well, let's split up, as if we never met. Take care.}
