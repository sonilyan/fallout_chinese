{200}{}{你看到一个老男人，他在对你微笑。}
#{250}{}{You see Jonathan, he's smiling at you.}
{250}{}{你看乔纳森，他在对你微笑。}
#{400}{}{Better stop it before my darlings rip you to pieces.}
{400}{}{最好在我的宝贝们把你撕成碎片之前停下来。}
#{500}{}{Hello there, what brings you to this part of the wasteland?}
{500}{}{你好，什么风把你吹来了这片荒地？}
#{501}{}{Hello, I'm }
{501}{}{你好，我是}
#{502}{}{Are you Jonathan?}
{502}{}{你是乔纳森吗？}
#{503}{}{Just passing by, see you.}
{503}{}{只是路过，再见。}

#{506}{}{Bye-bye.}
{506}{}{再见。}
#{550}{}{Oh, so rude of me to not introduce myself. I'm Jonathan. You know how it is, I don't get many visits 'round here.}
{550}{}{哦，我真没礼貌，不作自我介绍。我是乔纳森。你知道的，我在这附近很少有人来看我。}
#{551}{}{You don't meet any travelers here? How about problems with raiders?}
{551}{}{你在这里没遇到过客吗？突袭者有什么问题吗？}
#{552}{}{What is this place?}
{552}{}{这是什么地方？}
#{553}{}{What do you do here?}
{553}{}{你在这里做什么？}
#{554}{}{Charlie sent me, I hope you know him. He said you'll pay me for the junk I bought from him.}
{554}{}{查理派我来的，希望你认识他。他说你会为我从他那里买的垃圾付钱的。}
#{555}{}{Charlie sent me, I hope you know him. He said you'll pay me for the junk I bought from him.}
{555}{}{查理派我来的，希望你认识他。他说你会为我从他那里买的垃圾付钱的。}
#{556}{}{I'll be going, then.}
{556}{}{那我就去。}
#{600}{}{This is my home. It used to be a scrapyard before the war; this was where cars were brought and then scrapped or stripped. It just needed a bit of touching up here and there and it's a nice little place, don't you think?}
{600}{}{这是我的家。战前这里曾是一个废品场；这里是汽车被运到这里，然后被报废或剥离的地方。只是需要在这里和那里稍加修饰，这是个不错的小地方，你不觉得吗？}
#{601}{}{You don't meet any travelers here? How about problems with raiders?}
{601}{}{你在这里没遇到过客吗？突袭者有什么问题吗？}
#{602}{}{And what do you do here?}

#{605}{}{I'll be going then.}
{605}{}{那我就去。}
#{650}{}{The land's kind of empty 'round here, there's nothing as far as the eye sees; in fact, nobody stops by and the raiders just leave me alone. I got nothing they might want. You're the first person to show up here in a long time.}
{650}{}{这里的土地有点空旷，肉眼看不到任何东西；事实上，没有人路过，掠夺者只留下我一个人。我没有得到他们想要的东西。你是很久以来第一个出现在这里的人。}
#{651}{}{So what is this place?}
{651}{}{这是什么地方？}
#{652}{}{What about wild animals?}
{652}{}{野生动物呢？}
#{653}{}{And what do you do here?}
{653}{}{你在这里做什么？}
#{654}{}{Charlie sent me, I hope you know him. He said you'll pay me for some junk I bought from him.}
{654}{}{查理派我来的，希望你认识他。他说你会付钱给我买一些我从他那里买的垃圾。}

#{656}{}{I'll be going then.}
{656}{}{那我就去。}
#{700}{}{Yeah, they do give me a little trouble now and then. But me and my dogs have always dealt with them so far. They are my darlings.}
{700}{}{是的，他们偶尔会给我一些麻烦。但到目前为止，我和我的狗一直在对付他们。他们是我的宝贝。}
#{701}{}{So what do you do here?}
{701}{}{你在这里做什么？}

{704}{}{查理派我来的，希望你认识他。他说你会付钱给我买一些我从他那里买的垃圾。}
#{705}{}{See you, then.}
{705}{}{那么再见。}
#{750}{}{What do you mean? I live here, I like peacefulness. But I'm always glad to see someone. It's good to have someone around to spare a word with.}
{750}{}{你什么意思？我住在这里，我喜欢安静。但我总是很高兴见到某人。有人在身边跟你说几句话真好。}
#{751}{}{You don't get to see any travelers here? How about problems with raiders?}
{751}{}{你在这里看不到任何旅行者？突袭者有什么问题吗？}

#{755}{}{See you then.}
{755}{}{到时候见。}
#{800}{}{Yep, I'm Jonathan. What brings you here?}

#{803}{}{Nothing, really. Just asking.}
{803}{}{没什么，真的。只是问问而已。}
#{850}{}{OK, show me what you got.}
{850}{}{好吧，让我看看你有什么。}
#{851}{}{[Give him everything you bought from Charlie.]}
{851}{}{[把你从查理那里买的东西都给他。]}
#{852}{}{Damn, I must have dropped it somewhere.}
{852}{}{妈的，我一定是掉在什么地方了。}
#{900}{}{OK, show me what you got.}
{900}{}{好吧，让我看看你有什么。}
#{901}{}{[Give him everything you bought from Charlie.]}
{901}{}{[把你从查理那里买的东西都给他。]}
#{902}{}{Damn, I must have dropped it somewhere.}
{902}{}{妈的，我一定是掉在什么地方了。}
#{950}{}{So what's this all about? You've got nothing on you. Try looking for the stuff, I'm sure we'll figure something out.}
{950}{}{这是怎么回事？你身上什么都没有。试着找东西，我相信我们会找到办法的。}
#{951}{}{Can I ask you about something else?}
{951}{}{我能问你点别的事吗？}
#{952}{}{Can I ask you about something else?}
{952}{}{我能问你点别的事吗？}
#{953}{}{Yeah, I'll do that.}
{953}{}{是的，我会的。}
#{1000}{}{Junk you say! Look at this. [He takes out a rusty object.] This might come mighty useful. And this! [He jabbed at an unidentifiable part.] That's what I call a nice catch! How much did Charlie say this is worth?}
{1000}{}{你说的垃圾！看看这个。[他拿出一个生锈的东西]这可能非常有用。还有这个！[他戳了戳一个无法辨认的部位。]这就是我所说的漂亮接球！查理说这个值多少钱？}
#{1001}{}{ caps.}
{1001}{}{瓶盖。}
#{1002}{}{ caps.}
{1002}{}{瓶盖。}
#{1050}{}{Yep, that'll do. This catch's worth it. Here they are.}
{1050}{}{是的，就这样。这次抓捕是值得的。他们来了。}
#{1051}{}{Thanks, can I ask you something else?}
{1051}{}{谢谢，我能问你点别的吗？}
#{1052}{}{Thanks, can I ask you something else?}
{1052}{}{谢谢，我能问你点别的吗？}
#{1053}{}{Thanks, I'll be going, then.}
{1053}{}{谢谢，那我就去。}
#{1054}{}{Thanks, I'll be going, then.}
{1054}{}{谢谢，那我就去。}
#{1100}{}{These are some solid things but }
{1100}{}{这些东西很坚固，但是}
#{1101}{}{ is too much. Here, take }
{1101}{}{太多了。来，拿着}
#{1102}{}{, you'll still earn good money on this.}
{1102}{}{，你还是可以赚很多钱的。}
#{1103}{}{Fine then, can I ask you something else?}
{1103}{}{好吧，我能问你点别的吗？}
#{1104}{}{Fine then, can I ask you something else?}
{1104}{}{好吧，我能问你点别的吗？}
#{1105}{}{Well, OK, I'd better go, then.}
{1105}{}{好吧，那我还是走吧。}
#{1106}{}{Well, OK, I'd better go, then.}
{1106}{}{好吧，那我还是走吧。}
#{1150}{}{That's a lot. But to hell with it! It's been a long time since Charlie managed to get his hands on stuff like this, here, take the caps. [Jonathan pays you.]}
{1150}{}{太多了。但见鬼去吧！查理很久没弄到这样的东西了，来，拿着瓶盖。[乔纳森付钱给你。]}
#{1151}{}{Thanks, can I ask you something else?}
{1151}{}{谢谢，我能问你点别的吗？}
#{1152}{}{Thanks, can I ask you something else?}

{1153}{}{谢谢，那我就去。}
#{1154}{}{Thanks, I'll be going, then.}
{1154}{}{谢谢，那我就去。}
#{1200}{}{Sure you can. I'm glad I can waggle my tongue at somebody once again.}

#{1201}{}{I'm surprised there's someone willing to pay for garbage.}
{1201}{}{我很惊讶有人愿意付垃圾费。}
#{1202}{}{What do you know about Charlie? He seemed a little strange.}
{1202}{}{你对查理了解多少？他看起来有点奇怪。}
#{1203}{}{I think I'd better get going.}
{1203}{}{我想我该走了。}
#{1204}{}{Actually, I think I'll be on my way.}
{1204}{}{实际上，我想我会上路的。}
#{1250}{}{Call it what you like but these things are still useful. Everybody's living on the garbage of the past but they're acting just like before the war. They throw stuff away, stuff that's still good for something.}
{1250}{}{随便你怎么说，但这些东西还是有用的。每个人都生活在过去的垃圾里，但他们的行为和战前一样。他们扔掉一些东西，那些仍然有用的东西。}
#{1251}{}{And Charlie? What do you know about him? He seemed a little strange.}
{1251}{}{查理呢？你对他了解多少？他看起来有点奇怪。}
#{1252}{}{I'll be going, then.}
{1252}{}{那我就去。}
#{1253}{}{I'll be going, then.}
{1253}{}{那我就去。}
#{1300}{}{I don't get to see Charlie often but he's a good boy. He collects stuff for me, wherever he manages to, then sells it to me. I haven't seen him for a long time, I was getting worried. But it seems he ran into a good spot.}
{1300}{}{我不常见到查理，但他是个好孩子。他为我收集东西，不管他到哪里，然后卖给我。我好久没见到他了，我很担心。但他似乎遇到了一个好地方。}
#{1301}{}{I'm surprised there's someone willing to pay for garbage.}
{1301}{}{我很惊讶有人愿意付垃圾费。}
#{1302}{}{I'll be going, then.}
{1302}{}{那我就去。}
#{1303}{}{I'll be going, then.}
{1303}{}{那我就去。}
#{1350}{}{Wait. Since you're here, could you help me with something? I'd pay you handsomely, of course.}
{1350}{}{等待。既然你来了，你能帮我做点什么吗？当然，我会给你丰厚的报酬。}
#{1351}{}{What do you need?}
{1351}{}{你需要什么？}
#{1400}{}{Wait. Since you're here, could you help me with something? I'd pay you handsomely, of course.}
{1400}{}{等待。既然你来了，你能帮我做点什么吗？当然，我会给你丰厚的报酬。}
#{1401}{}{What do you need?}
{1401}{}{你需要什么？}
#{1450}{}{See, some strange mutated creatures have been showing up lately. Sometimes, when it's dark, they even attack. They never used to be around here before. In fact, I haven't seen anything like them until now. I think it has something to do with that guy living in a cave not far from here. He's never really bothered me before, the truth is I've only seen him once, but he's the only person who might know more about this.}
{1450}{}{看，最近出现了一些奇怪的变异生物。有时候，天黑的时候，它们甚至会攻击。他们以前从没在这附近住过。事实上，直到现在我还没见过像他们这样的人。我想这和住在离这儿不远的山洞里的那个家伙有关。他从来没有真正打扰过我，事实上我只见过他一次，但他是唯一一个可能知道更多这方面的人。}
#{1451}{}{So what do you want me to do?}
{1451}{}{那你想让我怎么做？}
#{1500}{}{I'll show you the map, mark the cave's location - you'd never find it without that. Find out as much as you can and try to get rid of those creatures for me if you can. I think I'll find something to pay you with.}
{1500}{}{我会给你看地图，标出洞穴的位置-没有它你永远找不到它。尽你所能找出更多，如果可以的话，帮我把那些生物除掉。我想我会找点东西给你的。}
#{1501}{}{OK, we have a deal.}
{1501}{}{好吧，我们说好了。}
#{1502}{}{That sounds too dangerous. I'm not interested.}
{1502}{}{听起来太危险了。我不感兴趣。}
#{1550}{}{Good, it's not far from here. [Shows you the location on the map.] Good luck, then.}
{1550}{}{很好，离这儿不远。[告诉你地图上的位置]祝你好运。}
#{1551}{}{Thanks.}
{1551}{}{谢谢。}
#{1600}{}{Oh well, I can't force you to help me.}
{1600}{}{我不能强迫你帮我。}
#{1601}{}{Goodbye.}
{1601}{}{再见。}
#{1650}{}{Ah, it's you. How are you, tell me. What brings you here again?}

#{1656}{}{I've brought you that stuff from Charlie if you're still want it. [Give it to him.]}

#{1657}{}{I'll deal with those mutated creatures for you. If you're still interested.}

#{1900}{}{So, what did you find out? I really want to get rid of those creatures.}
{1900}{}{那么，你发现了什么？我真的很想除掉那些生物。}
#{1901}{}{They were really coming from that man's cave. His name was Asmodeus and he used to be a Child of the Cathedral. He was taking care of those creatures and doing some experiments on them but they killed him.}

#{2350}{}{See, some strange mutated creatures have been showing up lately. Sometimes, when it's dark, they even attack. They never used to be around here before. In fact, I haven't seen anything like them until now. I think that guy living in a cave not far from here's got something to do with them. Or he just might know something. Show me the map on your Pip-Boy, yes, on that thing, I'll mark you the cave's location.}
{2350}{}{看，最近出现了一些奇怪的变异生物。有时候，天黑的时候，它们甚至会攻击。他们以前从没在这附近住过。事实上，直到现在我还没见过像他们这样的人。我想住在离这儿不远的山洞里的那个家伙和他们有关系。或者他可能知道些什么。给我看看你的皮普小子的地图，是的，在那东西上，我会给你标出洞穴的位置。}

#{2502}{}{Bye-bye.}

#{2550}{}{I know a few people, mostly from caravans. They stop by now and then when they need something fixed. Of course, they pay me for it. Doesn't happen very often but I got nothing to spend that money on. I got all I need, so they just pile up.}
{2550}{}{我认识几个人，大部分是商队的。当他们需要修理东西时，他们偶尔会停下来。当然，他们付钱给我。不常发生，但我没钱花。我有我所需要的，所以它们就堆起来了。}
#{2551}{}{I see. Thanks for the caps, I'll use them well. Take care.}
{2551}{}{我懂了。谢谢你的瓶盖，我会好好用的。当心。}
