#{100}{}{You see a citizen.}
{100}{}{你看到一个公民。}
#{101}{}{You see an ordinary resident of the slums.}
{101}{}{你看到一个贫民窟的普通居民。}
#{102}{}{Whatever you want, I'm not in the mood.}
{102}{}{不管你想要什么，我都没心情。}
#{103}{}{Fine, maybe I'll come back later.}
{103}{}{好吧，也许我晚点再来。}
#{104}{}{I'll make this quick.}
{104}{}{我会尽快的。}
#{105}{}{My husband does the talking in this house.}
{105}{}{我丈夫在这房子里说话。}
#{110}{}{Someone is badmouthing Harding. I want to know who and why.}
{110}{}{有人在说哈丁的坏话。我想知道是谁，为什么。}
#{111}{}{[He raises his eyebrows in surprise] You're seriously here on *his* behalf? Alright, here's what I've got to say: }
{111}{}{[他惊讶地扬起眉毛]你真的是代表他来的？好吧，我要说的是：}
#{112}{}{FUCK that sack of shit! And FUCK you, too! }
{112}{}{去他妈的！去你妈的！}
#{113}{}{Harding doesn't deserve to have someone like you looking out for him. }
{113}{}{哈丁不配有你这样的人照顾他。}
#{114}{}{Harding's a weak little bitch and he deserves everything he gets. Maybe if he wasn't so pathetic, he'd get more respect. But instead of fighting for respect like a man, he'd rather mope and whine and whatever he does at that secret club he goes to every Friday. Guys like him just won't ever improve themselves. }
{114}{}{哈丁是个软弱的小婊子，他得到的一切都是他应得的。也许如果他不那么可怜，他会得到更多的尊重。但他宁愿闷闷不乐，发牢骚，不管他在那个秘密俱乐部做什么，而不是像男人一样为尊重而战。像他这样的人永远也无法提高自己。}
#{115}{}{Now get out of my house, you simpering, bleeding-heart pussy!}
{115}{}{现在滚出我的房子，你这个傻笑的，流血的女人！}
#{116}{}{Now, with all due respect, please leave my house.}

#{117}{}{What secret club?}
{117}{}{什么秘密俱乐部？}
#{118}{}{Some weird out-of-towner is gathering up all the local rejects and holding weekly meetings. He says he just wants to help them out of the goodness of his heart, which is always a good sign someone's up to no good.}
{118}{}{一些奇怪的外地人聚集了当地所有的反对者，每周开一次例会。他说他只是出于内心的善良想帮助他们，这总是一个好迹象，表明有人在做坏事。}
#{119}{}{I should discuss this with Harding.}
{119}{}{我应该和哈定商量一下。}
#{120}{}{Hey, did you know your son lost Patrick's mail?}
{120}{}{嘿，你知道你儿子丢了帕特里克的邮件吗？}
#{121}{}{Oh, so that holier-than-thou shitbird didn't get his mama's cookies? Cry me a fucking river. Not so high and mighty anymore, is he?}
{121}{}{哦，那个比你还神圣的混蛋没有得到他妈妈的饼干？他妈的给我哭一场。他不再那么高大威武了，是吗？}
#{122}{}{Don't be rude. I'm leaving.}
{122}{}{别这么粗鲁。我要走了。}
#{123}{}{Watch your mouth! Do you know who I work for?}
{123}{}{小心你的嘴！你知道我为谁工作吗？}
#{124}{}{All I need is a letter. I'll pay money for it.}
{124}{}{我只需要一封信。我会付钱的。}
#{125}{}{You're playing with fire, you know. Patrick can only be so patient.}
{125}{}{你在玩火，你知道的。帕特里克只能如此耐心。}
#{126}{}{[He pales] Uhh - I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I just got a little carried away. Look, there's no package here. We never saw a package. All we have is this letter, see? Here, you take it! I'm cooperating, see?}
{126}{}{[他脸色苍白]呃-对不起！我很抱歉！我只是有点忘乎所以。看，这里没有包裹。我们从没见过包裹。我们只有这封信，明白吗？给，你拿着！我在合作，明白吗？}
#{127}{}{Don't let this happen again. Remember, in this city there's two types of people - those with guns, and those that work for them. Now get out of my way.}
{127}{}{别让这种事再发生了。记住，在这个城市里有两种人――持枪的和为他们工作的。现在给我让开。}
#{128}{}{Money? I like money. How much money are we talking?}
{128}{}{钱？我喜欢钱。我们谈的是多少钱？}
#{129}{}{I'll give you 100 dollars for the letter.}
{129}{}{我给你100美元买这封信。}
#{130}{}{Heh! Easiest hundred bucks I ever made! Here's the letter. Don't bother looking for the rest of the package, it's long gone.}
{130}{}{嘿！我赚了一百块！这是信。别费心找剩下的包裹了，早就不见了。}
#{131}{}{I'm not surprised. Give me the letter.}
{131}{}{我并不惊讶。把信给我。}
#{132}{}{Ha-ha-ha! Shut the fuck up. I've heard him talk - "oh, please, thank you, God bless you!" Spineless little prick. He'll never survive here.}
{132}{}{哈哈哈！他妈的闭嘴。我听过他说：“哦，求你了，谢谢你，上帝保佑你！”没骨气的小混蛋。他在这里活不下去了。}
#{133}{}{He's lasted this long. Even though he has no weapons, even though he's from out of town, even though he's interfering with the local politics, he's still alive. In fact, he doesn't look like he's even broken a sweat. And someone's sending him packages from out of town. What does that tell you?}
{133}{}{他坚持了这么久。即使他没有武器，即使他来自外地，即使他干涉了当地的政治，他仍然活着。事实上，他看起来一点也没出汗。有人从外地给他寄包裹。这说明了什么？}
#{134}{}{It - uh - [he suddenly looks very agitated] That package... Someone's spending a *lot* of money on him... Uh, hey, listen. The package is gone. I have this letter, though. Why don't you give it to him? Tell him, uh, I'm sorry for the delay. Really, really sorry.}
{134}{}{它-呃-[他突然看起来很激动]那个包裹。。。有人在他身上花了很多钱。。。呃，嘿，听着。包裹不见了。不过，我有这封信。你为什么不给他？告诉他，呃，很抱歉耽搁了。真的，真的很抱歉。}
#{135}{}{I'll give him this letter and you're apology. Watch yourself from now on - you won't be the only one.}
{135}{}{我把这封信给他，你就可以道歉了。从现在开始注意你自己-你不会是唯一的一个。}
#{136}{}{Forget it, I'm leaving.}

#{161}{}{You see a ragged woman. You'd say she looks lost in thought, but on second thought, you think she's just lost.}
{161}{}{你看到一个衣衫褴褛的女人。你可能会说她看起来陷入了沉思，但仔细想想，你认为她只是迷失了方向。}
#{162}{}{You see a ragged woman. She's looking at something a thousand miles away.}
{162}{}{你看到一个衣衫褴褛的女人。她在看千里之外的东西。}

#{215}{}{No, I don't believe you. Better luck next time.}
{215}{}{不，我不相信你。祝你下次好运。}
#{216}{}{Okay, I don't know anything about this girl. But there was a creepy guy living in this house before us. I got a look at his things when he was moving out. There was an album full of pictures of girls, and every one of them had holes burnt in their eyes!}
{216}{}{好吧，我对这个女孩一无所知。但在我们之前有个毛骨悚然的家伙住在这房子里。他搬出去的时候我看了他的东西。有一本全是女孩照片的相册，每个女孩的眼睛都被烧焦了！}
