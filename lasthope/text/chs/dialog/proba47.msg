{100}{}{你看：一个老农民。}
### {101}{}{Hello there, kid. Haven't seen strangers for years. But can't really talk right now, I'm in a big hurry. My damn plow broke down, then my shovel went missing, and now I'm not gonna finish my gardening on time. I can barely walk and now this... Ugh. Hey, kid... [Looking at you.] Wanna help an old fella?}
{101}{}{你好，孩子。多年没见过陌生人了。但我现在真的不能说话，我很着急。我那该死的犁坏了，然后我的铲子不见了，现在我不能按时完成园艺了。我几乎不能走路，现在。。。啊。嘿，孩子。。。[看着你。]想帮助一个老家伙吗？}
### {102}{}{Sure thing oldie... What do you need?}
{102}{}{老掉牙。。。你需要什么？}
### {103}{}{I'll be back later.}
{103}{}{我稍后回来。}
### {104}{}{Well, these old legs of mine won't let me stand up and walk around no more. I can work my field alright, years of hard work got me used to that, but anything else... [sighs] and there's no way for me to survive without my harvest. It's all I got. So listen, kid, I need a shovel, any kind will do just fine. If you find one or buy me a new one, I will be forever grateful. I really don't have any money to pay for it, but if it means something to you I could give you some food or something to drink because it's all I got and all I ever needed.}
{104}{}{好吧，我的这些老腿再也不能让我站起来走动了。我可以在我的领域工作，多年的努力让我习惯了这一点，但其他任何事情。。。没有收获，我就无法生存。这就是我的全部。听着，孩子，我需要一把铲子，任何一种都可以。如果你找到一个或给我买一个新的，我将永远感激你。我真的没有钱支付，但如果这对你有意义，我可以给你一些食物或饮料，因为这是我所拥有的，也是我所需要的。}
### {105}{}{I will return when I've found you a shovel.}
{105}{}{我给你找了铲子就回来。}
### {106}{}{Hey, sonny, have you brought me the shovel?}
{106}{}{嘿，孩子，你把铲子给我拿来了吗？}
### {107}{}{No, sir, still looking.}
{107}{}{没有，先生，还在看。}
### {108}{}{Yep, I got it, it's right here... [Show him the shovel.]}
{108}{}{是的，我明白了，就在这里。。。[给他看铲子。]}
### {109}{}{My goodness, what a nice shovel! Thank you so much. Here's some fruits from my garden. They are really fresh. You're gonna feel great after eating them.}
{109}{}{天哪，多么漂亮的铲子！非常感谢。这是我花园里的一些水果。它们真的很新鲜。吃了它们你会感觉很棒的。}
### {110}{}{Thanks, oldie. See ya later.}
{110}{}{谢谢，老爹。回头见。}
### {111}{}{You know, sonny, that shovel has really helped me. But I have a problem with my well. The water is pouring out every time I try to take some of it. It's the bucket, it's seriously messed up. I tried to fix it myself, but I'm too old for that. What's worse the bucket rope got untied and fell down into the well while I was messing with it. Now... I need a new rope and someone to fix the well. Please, I need that water or my plants are gonna get dry and die. Can you find a new rope for me, sonny?}
{111}{}{你知道，孩子，那把铲子真的帮了我。但我的井有问题。每次我试着拿水的时候，水都会倾泻而出。这是水桶，它一团糟。我试着自己修，但我太老了，不能修。更糟糕的是，当我摆弄吊绳时，吊绳解开掉到了井里。现在。。。我需要一根新绳子和一个人来修井。求你了，我需要这些水，否则我的植物就会干枯。你能给我找一根新绳子吗，孩子？}
### {112}{}{Yeah, I can do that.}
{112}{}{是的，我能做到。}
### {113}{}{Nah, I'm really busy right now.}
{113}{}{不，我现在真的很忙。}
### {114}{}{Have you fixed the well?}
{114}{}{你修井了吗？}
### {115}{}{Yep, it's done. Your well is working fine now.}
{115}{}{是的，已经完成了。你的水井现在运转良好。}
### {116}{}{No luck yet, still needs a rope.}
{116}{}{运气还不好，还需要一根绳子。}
### {117}{}{Fresh water from the well, just reminds me of the old days when I was just about your age. Hehe... You made this old man happy like nobody else has for quite some time! This was a real favor, kid. Here's some money I managed to collect. For your trouble. [Smiling.] Fine job indeed, sonny!}
{117}{}{井里的淡水，让我想起了我和你差不多大的时候的旧时光。呵呵。。。在相当长的一段时间里，你让这个老人感到前所未有的快乐！这真是帮了你一个忙，孩子。这是我设法筹到的一些钱。为了你的麻烦。干得不错，孩子！}
### {118}{}{Howdy, sonny! Nice to see you again. Hey, this old fella heard that some flowers could be used to make some powerful healing stuff. If this is really true, I want to try it myself. When I was younger I used to study chemicals and potions. Ooh, the old times... Yeah, there was one time I made an antidote for radscorpion poison! As I remember, I used the very poison from the scorpion's tail. Folks around know that and they are asking me to make some antidote for them... all the time. But I need a larger number of those broc flowers and a sample of radscorpion poison. Could you get me five flowers and about three scorpion tails?}
{118}{}{你好，孩子！很高兴再次见到你。嘿，这个老家伙听说一些花可以用来做一些强大的治疗物质。如果这真的是真的，我想自己试试。当我年轻的时候，我曾经学习化学药品和药水。哦，过去。。。是的，有一次我做了一种毒蝎的解药！我记得，我用的正是蝎子尾巴上的毒药。周围的人都知道这一点，他们要求我为他们做一些解药。。。总是但我需要更多的那些布洛克花和一个蛇蝎毒的样本。你能给我五朵花和大约三条蝎子尾巴吗？}
### {119}{}{You got it, grandpa.}
{119}{}{你明白了，爷爷。}
### {120}{}{Not now, grandpa. I'm in a hurry.}

{123}{}{是的，我就在这儿。给你。}
### {124}{}{Thatta boy! [Examines the flowers.] Very nice specimens. These fine folks gonna appreciate it, I'd better get down to work. Hey! I got some old bullets, I don't need 'em. Maybe you could sell 'em or somethin', I'm sure you'll get some money for them. Until next time, farewell, sonny.}
{124}{}{Thatta男孩！[检查花朵。]非常漂亮的标本。这些好人会感激的，我最好开始工作。嘿我有一些旧子弹，我不需要。也许你可以卖掉它们什么的，我相信你会得到一些钱。直到下一次，再见，孩子。}
