### {100}{}{Here is Sancho.}

### {101}{}{You see a slave. If you look closely, you will recognize in his dirty, emaciated face your fellow tribesman.}
{101}{}{你看到一个奴隶。如果你仔细看，你会从他那张又脏又瘦的脸上认出你的部落同胞。}
### {102}{}{Oops, I hope no one at the Villa finds out about this...}
{102}{}{哎呀，我希望别墅里没有人知道这件事...}
### {103}{}{The traitor! You're possessed by Diablo!}
{103}{}{叛徒！你被暗黑破坏神附身了！}

#The first dialog
### {200}{}{? It's you? What a surprise! And we already thought we were finished.}
{200}{}{？是你吗？真是个惊喜！我们已经以为我们完了。}
### {201}{}{I'm here to set you free.}
{201}{}{我是来放你自由的。}
### {202}{}{Great, you're just in time. Help us get to the exit. Then we will find our own way.}
{202}{}{太好了，你来得正是时候。帮我们到出口。然后我们会找到自己的路。}
### {203}{}{We're at the entrance. Freedom is very close.}
{203}{}{我们在入口处。自由是非常接近的。}
### {204}{}{Where are the others?}
{204}{}{其他人在哪里？}
### {205}{}{How did you end up in this trap?}
{205}{}{你是怎么掉进这个陷阱的？}
### {206}{}{How did you manage to remove the collars?}
{206}{}{你是怎么把项圈取下来的？}
### {207}{}{What can you tell us about these mines?}
{207}{}{关于这些矿井，你能告诉我们什么？}
### {208}{}{Sancho, I remember you disliked me at the Villa and called me a "one-legged mantis".}
{208}{}{桑乔，我记得你在别墅里不喜欢我，还说我是“独腿螳螂”。}
### {209}{}{Okay, let's go.}
{209}{}{好吧，我们走吧。}

### {210}{}{We were separated when we were brought to this city. Some were left in the pen, including se?ora Maria, your madre. The others were taken away somewhere, I haven't seen them since.}
{210}{}{当我们被带到这个城市时，我们被分开了。有些被留在了围栏里，包括你的夫人塞诺拉・玛丽亚。其他人被带到了什么地方，从那以后我再也没见过他们。}
### {211}{}{It was a failed plan. We wanted to dig a tunnel right into the wasteland and run through it, and for this we had to steal explosives. But everything went wrong. The explosion caused a chain of collapses, and we were cut off from the world.}
{211}{}{这是一个失败的计划。我们想在荒地里挖一条隧道，穿过它，为此我们不得不偷炸药。但一切都出了问题。爆炸造成了一连串的坍塌，我们与世界隔绝了。}
### {212}{}{One of the slaves said that collars do not work in the mines. }
{212}{}{其中一个奴隶说项圈在矿井里不工作。}
### {213}{}{Just a deep, damp hole. And there are these giant rodents all around. You won't find them in our Villa. They say that there are even more. Lucky we didn't come across them.}
{213}{}{只是一个又深又湿的洞。周围都是这些巨大的啮齿动物。你在我们的别墅里找不到他们。他们说还有更多。幸运的是，我们没有遇到他们。}
### {214}{}{Why did the mercenaries bring you here?}
{214}{}{雇佣军为什么把你带到这里？}
### {215}{}{They made me shovel the damn ore. At the top, it is cleaned and taken to another city. They say that it gives energy, but how it happens - I never understood. We have firewood and oil in our Villa for this, but you can't set fire to the stones! We're probably just being fooled.}
{215}{}{他们让我铲那该死的矿石。在顶部，它被清理干净，然后被带到另一个城市。他们说它能提供能量，但它是如何发生的――我从来都不明白。我们的别墅里有柴火和油，但你不能放火烧石头！我们可能只是被愚弄了。}
### {216}{}{Okay, okay, I was wrong! Let's forget what happened, we're from the same village! I won't say another bad word about you. Honestly.}
{216}{}{好吧，好吧，我错了！让我们忘记发生了什么，我们来自同一个村庄！我不会再说一句关于你的脏话了。真的}
### {217}{}{Wait, first tell me what happened.}
{217}{}{等等，先告诉我发生了什么。}

### {220}{}{What?}
{220}{}{什么}
### {221}{}{That rat was fucking huge!}
{221}{}{那只老鼠他妈的太大了！}
### {222}{}{Ugh, thanks for the help! Then we'll find our own way. It will be easier for a small group to escape from the mercenaries. In the meantime, take care of saving the rest of the residents of the Villa. We would have helped, but you understand that we are of little use after what we have experienced. Good luck.}
{222}{}{啊，谢谢你的帮助！然后我们会找到自己的路。一小群人会更容易逃离雇佣军。与此同时，请注意拯救别墅的其他居民。我们本可以提供帮助，但你知道，在经历了这些之后，我们没有什么用处。祝你好运}
### {223}{}{Okay. We'll meet at the Villa.}
{223}{}{可以我们将在别墅见面。}
### {224}{}{Yes, you know, I wouldn't want this tragedy to happen again. Try to blow up these damned mines. Maybe then the company will go bankrupt and stop looking for new slaves.}
{224}{}{是的，你知道，我不希望这种悲剧再次发生。试着炸毁这些该死的地雷。也许到那时，公司就会破产，不再寻找新的奴隶。}
### {225}{}{Blow up the mines? I like this idea!}
{225}{}{炸掉地雷？我喜欢这个主意！}
### {226}{}{Very doubtful. This will only add work to the slaves.}
{226}{}{非常可疑。这只会增加奴隶的工作量。}
### {227}{}{That's good. Explosives are in a warehouse inside the mine, and the administrator keeps the key to the warehouse with him. Good luck.}
{227}{}{这很好。炸药在矿井内的一个仓库里，管理员随身携带仓库的钥匙。祝你好运}
### {228}{}{Yes, leaving these mines is like feeding a rat king! The enterprise will simply find new slaves and continue its inhuman work. Don't you understand? Or are you still shaking from what you've been through? Okay, you think about it, and it's time for us to hit the road. Good luck.}
{228}{}{是的，离开这些矿井就像喂老鼠王一样！企业只会找到新的奴隶，继续其不人道的工作。你不明白吗？或者你还在为你所经历的一切而颤抖？好吧，你想一想，现在是我们上路的时候了。祝你好运}
### {229}{}{I'll think. Now get out of here.}
{229}{}{我会考虑的。现在离开这里。}
