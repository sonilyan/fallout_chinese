And no matter how high a title you hold in your "sect", it doesn't matter here! Do you understand that? Now get lost.}
{212}{}{就是这样。（逐渐提高了声音）现在你认为你可以闯入实验室，分散我的注意力？！（又提高了声音）明白了，你这个社会腐朽的家伙，这个实验室的工作最重要的是你在大教堂里的大惊小怪！无论你在你的“门派”中拥有多高的头衔，在这里都无关紧要！你明白吗？现在迷路吧。}
### {1212}{}{That's it. (gradually raises his voice) And now you think you can break into the lab and distract ME from my business?!

#Questions about yourself
### {310}{}{I'm sorry, but who are you?}
{310}{}{对不起，你是谁？}
### {311}{}{ (waves his hand in frustration) That's what it means to be in the shadows... My name is Zach Zimmer. Professor Zach Zimmer. And I'm in charge of this research department. Practically, I am the third person in the whole church, after Aaron and the Counselor. You don't have to bend the knee.}
{311}{}{（沮丧地挥手）这就是在阴影中的意义。。。我的名字叫扎克・齐默。Zach Zimmer教授。我负责这个研究部门。实际上，我是整个教会的第三个人，仅次于亚伦和辅导员。你不必弯曲膝盖。}

### {312}{}{A scientist in our time is unusual.}
{312}{}{在我们这个时代，科学家是不寻常的。}
### {313}{}{That's why I'm sitting in a Vault under the protection of the largest organization. Scientists without patrons can not survive in our time.}
{313}{}{这就是为什么我坐在一个受最大组织保护的保险库里。没有赞助人的科学家无法在我们这个时代生存。}
### {314}{}{And the Professor is the name?}
{314}{}{教授的名字是什么？}
### {315}{}{(sighs) Stupider question I have not heard.}
{315}{}{（叹气）这个愚蠢的问题我没听说过。}
### {316}{}{Professor is a title. And it is issued collectively.}
{316}{}{教授是一个头衔。它是集体发布的。}
### {317}{}{What an insight! I'll tell you a secret - at one time I took courses in a little-known organization in these parts. That's where I was awarded this title.}
{317}{}{多么有洞察力！我要告诉你一个秘密――有一段时间，我在一个鲜为人知的组织学习这些方面的课程。这就是我被授予这个称号的地方。}
### {318}{}{And how did you end up here, Professor?}
{318}{}{你是怎么来到这里的，教授？}
### {319}{}{You must have a very interesting story.}
{319}{}{你一定有一个非常有趣的故事。}
### {320}{}{It's a long story, and it's not for your ears. Let's just say there wasn't enough room for my ambitions in the West.}
{320}{}{说来话长，不适合你听。我们只能说，我在西方的雄心没有足够的空间。}
### {321}{}{In the west of California. I don't think you could have crossed the desert that separates us.}
{321}{}{在加利福尼亚州的西部。我认为你不可能穿越我们之间的沙漠。}
### {322}{}{Ahem. You ask too many questions.}
{322}{}{嗯。你问的问题太多了。}
### {323}{}{I'm a member of the Brotherhood of Steel. Surely, there is a detailed dossier on you at the base.}
{323}{}{我是钢铁兄弟会的成员。当然，基地里有关于你的详细档案。}
### {324}{}{It changes a lot. Yes, I came here with the Brotherhood of Steel. And he received the title from the Followers of the Apocalypse in the Burial Ground. But my colleagues and I disagreed, and I had to leave for Arizona.}
{324}{}{它变化很大。是的，我是和钢铁兄弟会一起来的。他获得了墓地启示录追随者的称号。但我和同事们意见相左，我不得不前往亚利桑那州。}
### {325}{}{What were the contradictions?}
{325}{}{矛盾是什么？}
### {326}{}{Let's put it this way... The followers of the Apocalypse are too soft. They oppose experiments on living people. And this slowed down many medical projects.}

### {327}{}{And what kind of Burial Ground?}
{327}{}{什么样的墓地？}
### {328}{}{Ruins to the west, beyond the Sonoran Desert. It's very far away, you can't get there.}
{328}{}{索诺兰沙漠以西的废墟。它很远，你到不了那里。}

### {330}{}{So you're also a Follower of Fire?}
{330}{}{所以你也是火的追随者？}
### {331}{}{What nonsense is this? I'm a scientist, not a preacher! Besides, many things in the teaching seem to me just ridiculous.}

{337}{}{哦它变化很大。。。那你最好和辅导员谈谈，而不是我。}
### {338}{}{This will remain between us.}
{338}{}{这将留在我们之间。}
### {339}{}{Aaron would have been nothing if he hadn't been put in charge of the city and the church. He still feels like a puppet, sometimes it pisses him off... However, I'm talking too much today.}
{339}{}{如果不是让亚伦掌管这座城市和教堂，他将一事无成。他仍然觉得自己像个木偶，有时会让他生气……然而，我今天说得太多了。}
### {340}{}{You can't trust anyone here.}
{340}{}{你不能相信这里的任何人。}
### {341}{}{For example?}
{341}{}{例如}
### {342}{}{I'm already tired of explaining simple things to all these monks. Better read the scientific literature.}
{342}{}{我已经厌倦了向这些僧侣解释简单的事情。最好读科学文献。}
### {343}{}{For example, the deification of elementary particles?}
{343}{}{例如，基本粒子的神化？}
### {344}{}{Precisely! What kind of ridiculous fiction is this, that a certain deity punished people with a Fiery Flood for their sins? It was a nuclear war! That is, an ordinary war with very powerful bombs.}
{344}{}{精确地这是什么荒谬的小说，某个神用洪水惩罚人们的罪行？那是一场核战争！也就是说，一场普通的战争，有非常强大的炸弹。}
### {345}{}{Don't they know that?}
{345}{}{难道他们不知道吗？}
### {346}{}{I'm afraid too much time has passed. The events of a bygone era are overgrown with myths and legends. On the other hand, the faith of Followers is useful for society... so far, it is not going against progress.}
{346}{}{恐怕时间过得太久了。过去时代的事件充斥着神话传说。另一方面，信徒的信仰对社会有益。。。到目前为止，这并没有妨碍进展。}

### {350}{}{Why are you snapping at subordinates?}
{350}{}{你为什么对下属大发雷霆？}
### {351}{}{Because I'm tired of idiots and ignorant monkeys.}

{353}{}{我不打算讨论这个问题。}
### {354}{}{I think this is a projection of unfulfilled hopes. Aren't you being given proper freedom?}
{354}{}{我认为这是未实现的希望的投射。你没有得到适当的自由吗？}

### {355}{}{(adjusts glasses in perplexity) Well, wow! Look, the first psychologist of a post-nuclear civilization! Leave these sweet consoling speeches to those who are sitting at the top. If they paid more RESPECT to my cause, I wouldn't have to raise my voice to everyone I met.}
{355}{}{（困惑地调整眼镜）哇！看，后核文明的第一位心理学家！把这些甜蜜的安慰演讲留给那些坐在最高层的人吧。如果他们更加尊重我的事业，我就不必向我遇到的每一个人大声说话了。}
### {356}{}{Of course, whatever you say.}
{356}{}{当然，不管你说什么。}
### {357}{}{What is a "monkey"?}

### {359}{}{[Science 20] They say that labor has made people out of monkeys.}
{359}{}{[科学20]他们说劳动使人脱离了猴子。}
### {360}{}{Nonsense! I managed to find old texts where it is clearly stated that these are two different branches of evolution with the same ancestors. However... it is much more important that I hear it from the mouth of a commoner.}
{360}{}{胡说我设法找到了一些古老的文本，其中明确指出这是进化的两个不同分支，有着相同的祖先。然而更重要的是，我是从一个平民的口中听到这句话的。}

#Questions about the bomb
### {378}{}{And you designed all this yourself?}
{378}{}{这一切都是你自己设计的？}
### {379}{}{Of course. Many years of painstaking work of a handful of scientists.}
{379}{}{当然少数科学家多年的辛勤工作。}
### {380}{}{Is that a nuclear bomb you have? Impressive.}
{380}{}{你有核弹吗？给人印象深刻的}
### {381}{}{Perhaps this is the most difficult thing we have managed. No one, up to California and Texas, could have done it. And we are on the verge of completion! It remains only to wait for some details from Two-Sun.}
{381}{}{也许这是我们处理过的最困难的事情。除了加利福尼亚州和得克萨斯州，没有人能做到这一点。我们即将完成！它只是等待两个太阳的一些细节。}
### {382}{}{California and... Texas?}
{382}{}{加利福尼亚州和。。。得克萨斯州？}
### {383}{}{(disappointed) Texas! These are parts of a bygone country, dumbass. Maybe they are called differently now, but before the War they were called that way.}
{383}{}{（失望）得克萨斯州！这些都是过去国家的一部分，蠢蛋。也许他们现在的称呼有所不同，但在战争之前，他们是这样称呼的。}
### {384}{}{But you wouldn't be able to construct it without instructions.}
{384}{}{但如果没有指令，你就无法构建它。}
### {385}{}{Hmm, you catch on the fly! Without instructions, we wouldn't have been able to get anything but cancer and leukemia. And the instructions were brought by order from an old military base, it's very far from here.}
{385}{}{嗯，你抓得很快！如果没有指示，除了癌症和白血病，我们什么都得不到。指示是根据一个旧军事基地的命令发出的，离这里很远。}
### {386}{}{And where do you get nuclear material?}
{386}{}{你从哪里得到核材料？}
### {387}{}{From Flagstaff, there is an operating uranium mine and a processing plant. The quality is low and the production is slow, but we have no other sources.}
{387}{}{弗拉格斯塔夫有一座正在运营的铀矿和一家加工厂。质量低，生产缓慢，但我们没有其他来源。}
### {388}{}{Why do you need such a powerful weapon?}
{388}{}{你为什么需要这么强大的武器？}
### {389}{}{Good question. Let's just say there are many reasons. And all of them are known only to one person in all of Phoenix - the Adviser himself.}
{389}{}{好问题。就说原因有很多吧。所有这些都只有菲尼克斯的一个人知道――顾问本人。}

#Research questions
### {400}{}{What kind of research does the laboratory do?}
{400}{}{实验室做什么样的研究？}
### {401}{}{Different, obviously. (goes into his thoughts) Our mission is... in order to first provide the Followers of Fire with everything they need... yes. And then take up the reconstruction of the city and its industrial facilities. After all, we need workers... And this is only the first part of the plan. The most important thing now is to eliminate the shortage of food and clean water in Phoenix.}
{401}{}{显然不同。（进入他的思想）我们的使命是……首先为火的追随者提供他们所需要的一切。。。对然后着手重建城市及其工业设施。毕竟，我们需要工人。。。这只是计划的第一部分。现在最重要的事情是消除菲尼克斯的食物和清洁水短缺问题。}
### {402}{}{And how are you doing?}
{402}{}{你过得怎么样？}
### {403}{}{There is progress, but it is too slow. The city is badly destroyed, old equipment is destroyed or worn out, and the production base of this Vault will only be enough to provide for the Cathedral. Add to this squabbles between individual clans in the city, illiteracy and a whole list of other problems. And if you don't have any more stupid questions, then I'll go back to finding solutions.}
{403}{}{有进展，但太慢了。这座城市被严重摧毁，旧设备被摧毁或磨损，这个金库的生产基地只够建造大教堂。再加上城市里各个部族之间的争吵、文盲和一大堆其他问题。如果你没有任何愚蠢的问题，那么我会回去寻找解决方案。}
### {404}{}{It seemed to me that the Followers were not so generous as to distribute food.}
{404}{}{在我看来，追随者们并没有慷慨地分发食物。}
### {405}{}{What are you talking about? No one is going to feed this rabble on the streets! Food and water are unconditional power over the whole city. In exchange for food, the locals are ready to do any job, and we need cheap workers.}
{405}{}{你在说什么？没有人会在街上喂这些乌合之众！食物和水是整个城市无条件的力量。作为食物的交换，当地人愿意做任何工作，我们需要廉价的工人。}
### {406}{}{Power? What a banality.}
{406}{}{权力多么平庸啊。}
### {407}{}{What narrowness of views! Power is just a mechanism. When we created the cult of Fire, there was no power in this city. And there were pathetic primates feuding among themselves over a dead rat. And look at the city now. With our submission, electricity and currency returned here, industry and education were born, even gambling appeared! And all this thanks to the heavy hand of the cult, which put the local monkeys straight.}
{407}{}{视野多么狭窄！权力只是一种机制。当我们创建火崇拜时，这个城市没有权力。可怜的灵长类动物为了一只死老鼠而互相争斗。现在看看这座城市。随着我们的屈服，电力和货币回到了这里，工业和教育诞生了，甚至赌博也出现了！这一切都要归功于邪教的重拳出击，他们让当地的猴子挺直了腰板。}
### {408}{}{[Science 100] How confident are you that society is ready for such innovations?}
{408}{}{【科学100】你对社会已经为这种创新做好了准备有多大信心？}
### {409}{}{I've been thinking about it a lot......}
{409}{}{我想了很多。。。。。。}
