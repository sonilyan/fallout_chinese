{100}{}{Yes, can I help you?}
{101}{}{Do you sell something here?}
{102}{}{What is this place?}
{103}{}{No, I was just leaving.}
#sell...
{104}{}{Of course, you must be looking for some of our finest laborers. They are hard working and well trained slaves.
 You aren't going to find such a good offer anywhere else. Please, take your time. So, want to see our stock?}
{105}{}{No thanks, let me ask you something.}
{106}{}{Actually, I have to be going now.}
#something...
{107}{}{Alright, just be quick about it.}
#this place...
{108}{}{This is our storage facility. We've got two sectors, one at the upper level and this one. Well, we got a third
 level below but we have no use for it. This place was a real mess when we first came. Some cleaning did the job pretty
 well. We were surprised to see all critical life support systems working, guess we were lucky.}
{109}{}{Sure, see you later.}
#
{110}{}{Not yet, so you got a lot of work lately?}
#
{111}{}{You bet. Every day, we can barely keep our stock full... But it's pure profit. Sometimes it can be a real pain in
 the ass. For example, I hate office paperwork... But my boss insists. I have to carry this account book with me all day
 long, because the boss said so... Bastard!}
{112}{}{Sorry to hear that, I'll be going now.}
#
{113}{}{You said you sell slaves here?}
#
{114}{}{Thanks for the story, can I ask you something?}
#
{115}{}{I see, I want to ask you something.}
#
{116}{}{It's you again, what can I do for you?}
#
{117}{}{Nothing, I was just leaving.}
