#{101}{}{Before you stands the trader - Roger Quok.}
{101}{}{在你站在交易者面前-罗杰・库克。}
#{109}{}{What now?}
{109}{}{现在怎么办？}
#{110}{}{Hello, wanderer! The Quok brothers always have a lot of useful stuff for the road. Choose, you won't regret it!}
{110}{}{你好，流浪者！库克兄弟总是有很多有用的东西。选择，你不会后悔的！}
#{111}{}{Oh! Good choice! Though, I'm sorry, I had to raise prices, because some kind of scoundrel robbed us...}
{111}{}{哦！不错的选择！尽管如此，我很抱歉，我不得不提高价格，因为一些无赖抢劫了我们。。。}
#{112}{}{[Trade]}
{112}{}{[贸易]}
#{113}{}{Hey! I just saw someone jumping to our yard! I think it was a thief!}
{113}{}{嘿！我刚看见有人跳到我们的院子里！我想是小偷！}
#{114}{}{There is one poor guy that can't find a job. Maybe you could put him somewhere in the back room? He does not need much...}
{114}{}{有一个可怜的家伙找不到工作。也许你可以把他放在后面房间的某个地方？他不需要太多。。。}
#{115}{}{Thanks, but no.}
{115}{}{谢谢，不过不用了。}
#{116}{}{Work, you say? Well, if you think about it, there is something. Not for the soft handed. You tell him, to come to us, we'll talk.}
{116}{}{工作，你说？好吧，如果你仔细想想，肯定有什么。不适合手软的人。你告诉他，来找我们，我们谈谈。}
#{117}{}{Okay!}
{117}{}{可以！}
#{118}{}{Are you sure you don't need anything?}
{118}{}{你确定你什么都不需要吗？}
#{119}{}{Let's see what you have one more time...}
{119}{}{让我们再看看你还有什么。。。}
#{120}{}{No, bye.}
{120}{}{不，再见。}
#{129}{}{Shit! I'll show him!!..}
{129}{}{倒霉！我会给他看的！！。。}
#{130}{}{[Look as they catch the thief]}
{130}{}{[看着他们抓住小偷]}
#{131}{}{You ratted your partner!}
{131}{}{你出卖了你的搭档！}
#{132}{}{Hey, wanderer! Come here, I have a question.}
{132}{}{嘿，流浪汉！过来，我有个问题。}
#{133}{}{Hold it right there! I have a shotgun!}
{133}{}{别动！我有一把猎枪！}
#{134}{}{NO!!! NOT THIS!!!}
{134}{}{不！！！不是这个！！！}
#{135}{}{You should've thought earlier! Now come out.}
{135}{}{你早该想到的！现在出来。}
#{136}{}{You did the right thing to tell us. The sheriff was looking for him for a long time. Now the city will become more calm. You know, in our time people usually don't do something for the sake of good. I do not know why you did it, but I consider myself obligated to repay you. Here's 500 bucks for honesty and one of my favorite guns. I hope you like it.}
{136}{}{你告诉我们是对的。警长找了他很长时间。现在城市将变得更加平静。你知道，在我们这个时代，人们通常不会为了利益而做一些事情。我不知道你为什么这样做，但我认为我有义务报答你。这是500美元的诚实和我最喜欢的枪之一。希望你喜欢。}
#{137}{}{This gun is amazing!}
{137}{}{这把枪太棒了！}

{138}{}{[下一步]}
#{139}{}{No competitors, my friend, I promise. And my word in these parts means something.}
{139}{}{没有竞争对手，我的朋友，我保证。我的话在这些地方有意义。}
#{140}{}{Sorry, but with such products and prices, I can only get out. Although, wait, maybe you know how to make money around here?}
{140}{}{对不起，这样的产品和价格，我只能下车了。不过，等等，也许你知道怎么在这赚钱？}
#{141}{}{Hmm, I know of one place where you can make good money. But I'm not sure about you - you may run to competitors!}
{141}{}{嗯，我知道有一个地方你可以赚很多钱。但我不确定你-你可能会跑到竞争对手那里！}
#{142}{}{Not sure? Hey, I'm not a trader! I see - you won't change your mind...}
{142}{}{不确定？嘿，我不是商人！我明白了-你不会改变主意的。。。}
#{143}{}{I see you're really a person of action... I'll give you the coordinates of that place. Get inside, take everything that you see, and bring it to me. Then we will trade.}
{143}{}{我看你真的是一个行动的人。。。我给你那个地方的坐标。进去，把你看到的东西都拿给我。那我们就交易。}
#{144}{}{Great. What is the place?}
{144}{}{伟大的。什么地方？}
#{145}{}{It's in the mountains, on the other side of the salt valley. Some unusual person lives there since the Great War. It is said that it is an eerie sight to see, and that bullets don't hurt him. And his name is Harrelson. But most importantly - he supposedly has untold riches, which he collected after the War. Many went hunting after him, but few returned. His den is about here. [Shows on the map]}
{145}{}{在山里，在盐谷的另一边。自大战以来，有个不寻常的人住在那里。据说这是一个可怕的景象，子弹不会伤害他。他的名字叫哈勒森。但最重要的是，据说他拥有数不清的财富，这些财富是他在战后收集的。许多人去追捕他，但很少有人回来。他的书房就在这附近。[在地图上显示]}
#{146}{}{Fine, I'll think about it.}
{146}{}{好吧，我会考虑的。}
#{147}{}{It's pretty silly to miss this chance.}
{147}{}{错过这个机会真是太傻了。}
#{148}{}{No, that won't do.}
{148}{}{不，那不行。}
#{149}{}{Come on, all the caravans know me as a reliable partner.}
{149}{}{拜托，所有的商队都知道我是可靠的搭档。}
#{150}{}{Hey, those are mine!}
{150}{}{嘿，那些是我的！}
#{151}{}{Really?! In any case, it's not my problem - I got these things in an honest fair way. Therefore, if you want something - buy it.}
{151}{}{真正地？！无论如何，这不是我的问题-我是以诚实公正的方式得到这些东西的。因此，如果你想要什么-买它。}
#{152}{}{Grm...}
{152}{}{Grm。。。}
#{161}{}{Yes I do need something, but you don't have it. Actually, you don't have a lot of things.}
{161}{}{是的，我确实需要一些东西，但你没有。事实上，你没有很多东西。}
#{162}{}{Be thankful that we have what we have. It's not the times to ask for a lot.}
{162}{}{感谢我们拥有我们所拥有的。现在不是要求太多的时候。}
#{163}{}{Yeah... But it seemed to me that in such a large city the assortment should be many times more diverse, than in the settlements. There is something you're not telling me.}
{163}{}{是 啊。。。但在我看来，在这样一个大城市里，各种各样的东西应该比在定居点里多样化许多倍。有件事你没告诉我。}
#{164}{}{Well, it's not that it's a secret. It's just... Usually, no one understands where the goods come from and how hard it is to get it. Why do you care?}
{164}{}{嗯，这不是秘密。只是。。。通常，没人知道货物从哪里来，要拿到有多难。你为什么在乎？}
#{165}{}{You see, I also do business from time to time, trading in different cities. So I'm interested in the local market.}
{165}{}{你看，我也经常做生意，在不同的城市交易。所以我对本地市场感兴趣。}
#{166}{}{Just curious. Don't mind me.}
{166}{}{只是好奇。别介意我。}
#{167}{}{Hmm, you seem like someone I can trust. Okay, listen. Salt Lake was destroyed in 2077 by thirteen nuclear explosions. Almost the entire northern half of the city was burnt. Add to this "troubled times" and unsanitary conditions - and you will have a beautiful picture of our current situation.}
{167}{}{嗯，你看起来是我可以信任的人。好吧，听着。盐湖城在2077年被13次核爆炸摧毁。几乎整个城市的北半部都被烧毁了。再加上这个“动乱时期”和不卫生的条件，你就会对我们目前的状况有一个美丽的了解。}
#{168}{}{[Next]}
{168}{}{[下一步]}
#{169}{}{Things are worn out, factories are destroyed, medicines are all used up... But on the other hand, we have a lot of equipment left from the old city. Unlike Vegas or Reno. They have other crafts there, and we have ours. Caravans bring machinery for repair or purchase some parts, and in exchange they trade medicines and other important things.}
{169}{}{东西破旧了，工厂被毁了，药品都用光了。。。但另一方面，我们还有很多老城区遗留下来的设备。不像维加斯和雷诺。他们还有别的手艺，我们也有。商队带着机器来修理或购买一些零件，作为交换，他们买卖药品和其他重要物品。}
#{170}{}{And what about marauders? Don't they try to loot the northern ruins?}
{170}{}{那劫掠者呢？他们不想洗劫北方的废墟吗？}
#{171}{}{Marauders? Perhaps you are talking about prospectors? We usually call them that. But the sheriff does not like them. He strictly forbids anyone to go to the northern part of the city. And those who dare are punished rather harshly, including pillars of shame, fines and even short-term hard labor. True, this is not the only prospectors problem, more often you have to deal with people from Denver.}
{171}{}{劫掠者？也许你说的是探矿者？我们通常这样称呼他们。但是警长不喜欢他们。他严格禁止任何人到城市的北部去。而那些胆敢的人将受到相当严厉的惩罚，包括耻辱柱、罚款甚至短期苦役。诚然，这不是唯一的探矿者的问题，更多的时候你必须与来自丹佛的人打交道。}
#{172}{}{Do you even check things that you get?}
{172}{}{你有没有检查过你拿到的东西？}
#{173}{}{Tell me about Denver.}
{173}{}{告诉我丹佛的事。}
#{174}{}{Why does the sheriff prohibit such a "practice" in the ruins of Salt Lake?}
{174}{}{为什么警长禁止在盐湖城废墟上这样的“做法”？}
#{175}{}{Thanks for the review. I will now keep it in mind. See you.}
{175}{}{谢谢你的评论。我现在要记住这一点。再见。}
#{176}{}{Well, of course! I have a Geiger counter in the back room, I often use it to check the goods.}
{176}{}{好吧，当然！我在后面的房间里有一个盖革计数器，我经常用它来检查货物。}
#{177}{}{This city was also unlucky. It was partially destroyed and held some pre-war riches. The difference is, there is much more in Denver, than here. Those are the riches the prospectors are trying to find. As far as I know, they have a full blown turf wars going on there. Sometimes a caravans come from there with decent loot, but it's sometimes radioactive or in poor condition. In any way, it is better than nothing.}
{177}{}{这个城市也很不幸。它被部分摧毁，并持有一些战前的财富。不同的是，丹佛比这里多得多。这些是勘探者们试图寻找的财富。据我所知，那里正在进行一场全面的地盘争夺战。有时一个大篷车从那里来了体面的战利品，但它有时是放射性或在恶劣的条件。无论如何，总比什么都没有强。}
#{178}{}{He says it's dangerous and that any thing from there can be contaminated with radiation or some kind of fatal infection. I'll tell you how it is - it really happened, though not often. But I think he's more afraid that someone would find something special. Something from the army past of Salt Lake City. Here in fact there was a large military base in the north. It was bombed seventy years ago.}
{178}{}{他说这是危险的，那里的任何东西都可能受到辐射或某种致命的感染。我来告诉你这是怎么发生的，虽然不经常发生。但我觉得他更害怕有人会发现一些特别的东西。盐湖城军队过去的事。事实上，这里在北方有一个大型军事基地。它是七十年前被炸的。}
#{179}{}{You got 200 experience points for successfully applying the trade skill in talking about business processes in Salt Lake.}
{179}{}{你在盐湖城成功运用贸易技巧谈论业务流程，获得200个经验点。}
#{180}{}{Right.}
{180}{}{正确的。}
#{1110}{}{Hello, wanderer! The Quok brothers always have a lot of useful stuff for the road. Choose, you won't regret it!}
{1110}{}{你好，流浪者！库克兄弟总是有很多有用的东西。选择，你不会后悔的！}
#{1113}{}{Hey! I just saw someone jumping to our yard! I think, it was a thief!}
{1113}{}{嘿！我刚看见有人跳到我们的院子里！我想，是小偷！}
#{1132}{}{Hey, wanderer! Come here, I have a question.}
{1132}{}{嘿，流浪汉！过来，我有个问题。}
#{1136}{}{You did the right thing to tell us. The sheriff was looking for him long ago. Now the city will become calmer. You know, in our time people usually don't do something for the sake of good.
