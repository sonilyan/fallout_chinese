### {201}{}{Ok.}
{201}{}{好啊}
### {202}{}{Why on earth would I listen to you?}
{202}{}{我到底为什么要听你的？}
### {203}{}{Are you looking for death or are you not friends with your head? So twist a little convolutions. This is OUR territory. Find yourself another factory and do whatever you want there. And don't get in here.}
{203}{}{你是在寻找死亡，还是你的头脑不是朋友？所以稍微扭转一下。这是我们的领土。找另一家工厂，在那里做任何你想做的事。别进来。}
### {204}{}{OK.}
{204}{}{好啊}
### {205}{}{It was yours, and now it will be mine. It's simple.}
{205}{}{它是你的，现在将是我的。这很简单。}
### {206}{}{Where are you going? Have you lost all fear? Get out of here!}
{206}{}{你要去哪里？你失去了所有的恐惧吗？滚出去！}
### {1206}{}{Where are you going? Have you lost all fear? Get out of here!}
{1206}{}{你要去哪里？你失去了所有的恐惧吗？滚出去！}
### {207}{}{Stop! This is our te... Damn, super mutant! All ready to fight!}
{207}{}{停止这是我们的...该死，超级变种人！一切准备战斗！}

{208}{}{哦，不，不，等等...}
### {209}{}{OK. It's your own fault, asshole...}
{209}{}{好吧，这是你自己的错，混蛋...}

### {210}{}{I know what's going on here. You work without the permission of the Old City. And besides, you have enslaved the ghouls.}
{210}{}{我知道这里发生了什么。你未经老城允许就工作。此外，你还奴役了食尸鬼。}
### {211}{}{Yes. And what?}

### {215}{}{Why do you need ghouls?}
{215}{}{你为什么需要食尸鬼？}
### {216}{}{Because we are not made of steel. Do you understand? We don't have enough protection to work in a toxic zone. And ghouls can work there for hours without harm to their health. So let them work, they bring benefits to people.}
{216}{}{因为我们不是钢做的。你明白吗？我们没有足够的保护来在有毒区域工作。食尸鬼可以在那里工作数小时而不会损害他们的健康。所以让他们工作，他们给人们带来好处。}
### {217}{}{Clear.}
{217}{}{清楚的}
### {218}{}{Why do you refuse to receive Seth's Seal?}
{218}{}{你为什么拒绝接受赛斯的封印？}

{219}{}{旧时代的财富属于发现它们的人。这很公平。这是正确的。我们对他们和亡灵有同样的权利。我们要把这些财富留给他们！}
### {220}{}{What are you looking for here anyway?}
{220}{}{你在这里找什么？}
### {221}{}{Everything that will be useful for sale in the Hub. But the most relish here is the chips. There are guys in the north who will pay well for them.}
{221}{}{所有有用的东西都可以在Hub中出售。但这里最令人津津乐道的是薯片。北方有些人会为他们付出高昂的代价。}
### {222}{}{And now I want to know, what do you care about ghouls and our factory?}
{222}{}{现在我想知道，你关心食尸鬼和我们的工厂吗？}
### {223}{}{None. Can I just leave?}

{226}{}{见鬼去吧，我把枪装上子弹，把你们都射了。}
### {227}{}{Uh, no, this job is not for me.}
{227}{}{不，这份工作不适合我。}
### {228}{}{Then get out of our territory!}
{228}{}{那就滚出我们的地盘！}
### {229}{}{OK.}

### {232}{}{Agreed.}
{232}{}{同意。}
### {233}{}{You've become quite impudent. It will be easier to take all of you out of here feet first!}
{233}{}{你变得相当厚颜无耻。先把你们带出去会更容易！}
### {234}{}{I'm still waiting for the chip. Come on, surprise me!}
{234}{}{我还在等芯片。来吧，给我一个惊喜！}
### {235}{}{Fuck you!}
{235}{}{操你！}
### {236}{}{I'm really trying. Soon they will be at your feet.}

{241}{}{pcs。来吧，行动起来。}
### {242}{}{The last one? Ho-ho, and you're quicker than these guys. Great. You can have fun with your green-skinned friends. There's nothing else for us to do here. Ringing caps and hub women are waiting for us in the Maltese Falcon! Hey, brothers, get on your horses!}
{242}{}{最后一个？呵呵，你比这些家伙快。太棒了你可以和你的绿皮肤朋友玩得很开心。我们在这里没有别的事可做。Ringing caps和hub women在马耳他猎鹰号等着我们！嘿，兄弟们，快骑上你们的马！}
### {243}{}{I don't think anyone will miss you here.}
{243}{}{我想没有人会在这里想念你。}
### {244}{}{Bye.}
{244}{}{再见}
### {245}{}{Ugh! I thought you were another ghoul. And you're just a freak. We don't need them. Get out of here.}
{245}{}{啊！我以为你是另一个食尸鬼。而你只是个怪胎。我们不需要它们。离开这里。}

### {250}{}{I was sent by the mayor of the Old Town.}
{250}{}{我是老城区市长派来的。}
### {251}{}{Yes? And what does he want?}
{251}{}{对他想要什么？}
### {252}{}{Nothing. I just had to see what you were doing here.}
{252}{}{没有什么我只是想看看你在这里做什么。}
### {253}{}{He had some kind of suggestion. But I forgot which one. And it doesn't matter ? I was going to kill you all anyway!}
{253}{}{他提出了一些建议。但我忘了是哪一个。这并不重要? 无论如何，我都要杀了你们！}
### {1253}{}{He had some kind of suggestion. But I forgot which one. And it doesn't matter ? I was going to kill you all anyway!}
{1253}{}{他提出了一些建议。但我忘了是哪一个。这并不重要? 无论如何，我都要杀了你们！}
### {254}{}{He has a suggestion. He will give you the Seal of Set and open a collaboration. But you have to collect chips from this factory for him in a short time and release the forced ghouls.}
{254}{}{他有个建议。他会给你封印并开启合作。但你必须在短时间内为他从这家工厂收集芯片，并释放被强迫的食尸鬼。}
### {255}{}{So chips are important to gulichek, right? Ha, yes, we hit a gold mine! Okay, Seth's seal is an important thing, if you think about it. We won't have to carry tons of things far, we won't be oppressed and in general ? we will now become important people in the city, right? There's just one "but".}
{255}{}{所以芯片对古利切克很重要，对吧？哈，是的，我们碰到金矿了！好吧，如果你仔细想想，赛斯的印章是一件重要的事情。我们不必把很多东西带得很远，我们不会被压迫，而且总的来说? 我们现在将成为这个城市的重要人物，对吧？只有一个“但是”。}
### {256}{}{What is it?}
{256}{}{它是什么？}
### {257}{}{This factory is one fucking mole?rat hole! There are a lot of dangers and high radiation in places. And I also don't know a damn thing about all this technology. That's why I make ghouls work ? they don't care about radiation and they know well what's what. Therefore, if the "big boss" wants to fulfill the contract quickly, someone will have to work with pens in the danger zone.}
{257}{}{这家工厂是一个该死的鼹鼠?老鼠洞！有些地方有很多危险和高辐射。而且我对这些技术一无所知。这就是为什么我让食尸鬼工作? 他们不在乎辐射，他们很清楚什么是辐射。因此，如果“大老板”想迅速履行合同，就必须有人在危险地带用笔工作。}
### {258}{}{Apparently, only I can speed up this process.}
{258}{}{显然，只有我才能加快这个过程。}
### {259}{}{Great. Bring 10 chips.}

### {260}{}{Agreed.}
{260}{}{同意。}
### {261}{}{Completely oborzel? I'll collect the chips and give them to you instead. Get the fuck out of here!}
{261}{}{完全是oborzel？我会把筹码收集起来交给你。滚出去！}
### {262}{}{The last one? Ho-ho, and you're quicker than these guys. Great. You can have fun with your green-skinned friends. There's nothing else for us to do here. Ringing caps and hub women are waiting for us in the Maltese Falcon! Hey, brothers, get on your horses!}
{262}{}{最后一个？呵呵，你比这些家伙快。太棒了你可以和你的绿皮肤朋友玩得很开心。我们在这里没有别的事可做。Ringing caps和hub women在马耳他猎鹰号等着我们！嘿，兄弟们，快骑上你们的马！}
### {263}{}{The last one? Ho-ho, and you turned out to be more agile than these guys. Then we'll figure it out for ourselves. Jangling caps and booze are waiting for us in the Old Town. Hey, brothers, get on your horses!}
{263}{}{最后一个？呵呵，原来你比这些家伙更敏捷。然后我们自己想办法。喧闹的瓶盖和酒在老城区等着我们。嘿，兄弟们，快骑上你们的马！}
### {264}{}{It's done. It's really time to go back to the Old Town.}
{264}{}{它完成了。是时候回到老城区了。}
### {265}{}{Don't get cocky. Now the ghouls are the masters here. You will work for them and follow their rules.}
{265}{}{不要自大。现在食尸鬼是这里的主人。你将为他们工作并遵守他们的规则。}
