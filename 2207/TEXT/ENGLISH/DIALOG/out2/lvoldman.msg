### {120}{}{[Looks like he gazes through you] It is so good that you are alive! I believed, I knew you would make it to the Olympus and one day you will show up with good news, just as you promised. Nothing for so long... Mary didn't make it, I buried her recently, poor sob. She would be so glad. She felt very nervous, was thinking that you disappeared somewhere in the wasteland or forgot about your old folks. She was even saying that there's no salvation in Olympus, it's all fairy tales. Can you imagine? But for me, I believed, I hoped! And not in vain! How are the girls, how's Sam? Must be grown up by now. How are the others? }

### {130}{}{You know, Billy, you were right back then to leave this place, together with everyone in the village, and to look for salvation in the Olympus. We wouldn't make it in here. The well went completely dry, we barely had enough water for me and Mary. And the soil went bad - even the dillweed didn't grow. The jackals were always coming for us, looking for food. No one even wandered in here. It was a hard time. Our only hope was that you've made it to the tower and now are safe. This hope is all we had all these years. [He sighs] Sometimes, we were sitting together on the top of the hill with Mary, looking at the Olympus, thinking about how huge it is if you can see it from such a distance. And that means you and your family should find a place there. I miss them so much, my little grandchildren. I wonder how big are they now... [he closes his eyes and sinks into his thoughts]}
{130}{}{你知道，比利，你当时正和村里的每个人一起离开这个地方，去奥林匹斯山寻找救赎。我们进不了这里。井完全干涸了，我们几乎没有足够的水给我和玛丽喝。然后土壤变差了――连连野草都没长出来。豺狼总是来找我们，寻找食物。甚至没有人在这里闲逛。那是一段艰难的时光。我们唯一的希望是你已经到达了塔楼，现在安全了。这是我们这些年来的全部希望。[他叹了口气]有时，我们和玛丽一起坐在山顶上，看着奥林匹斯山，想着如果你能从这么远的地方看到它有多大。这意味着你和你的家人应该在那里找到一个地方。我非常想念他们，我的小孙子。我想知道它们现在有多大。。。[他闭上眼睛陷入沉思] -- You know, Billy, you were right back then to leave this place, together with everyone in the village, and to look for salvation in the Olympus.
