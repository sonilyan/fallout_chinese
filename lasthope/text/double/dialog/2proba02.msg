{100}{}{Greetings stranger. Can I help you with anything?}
{101}{}{What can you tell me about this place?}
{102}{}{What do you do here?}
{103}{}{Nothing. Just passing by.}
#about this place
{104}{}{About this place? Actually, I don’t know much. You see, all I know is that this was a military base and for
 some strange reason it was abandoned. I think it had something to do with the research they carried out in there.}
#
{105}{}{What kind of research?}
{106}{}{Alright. Thanks for the info.}
#
{107}{}{A secret one... including a genetic virus or something. There's a research lab below ground level, which
 was sealed after the accident. The virus spread through the air all over the base and there were some casualties, but
 we couldn't find a [...smiles...] volunteer to "investigate". The truth is, we don't have appropriate suits for that kind of
 contaminated environment. And personally, I wouldn't risk my ass only to find out there's nothing worth going
 down for. I strongly "recommend" you stay away. If that shit spreads outside... then God help us all.}
#
{108}{}{You said virus?! And... erm... genetic?! Whoa... I'm outta here!}
{109}{}{I'm going in to find out what happened to those casualties you mentioned. We should not just leave them to
 rot.}
#going there
{110}{}{You are dumber than you look! I can't let some smartass poking around with that deadly shit just a few meters
 below us. Everyone... it's time to teach this nosy parker some free shooting lessons!}
{111}{}{You first, shithead!}
#what do you do here
{112}{}{Because of the situation we've got here, we are keeping this base protected from anyone stupid enough to
 release that virus which by the way can't and will not reach the surface, not on my watch.}
#
{113}{}{What if someone tries to go down anyway?}
{114}{}{Thanks, I'll be going now.}
#
{115}{}{It's clear that person would jeopardize all of our lives and we will be forced to take some drastic measures.
 That goes for you too, got it?}
#
{116}{}{Hm, sure.}
#
{117}{}{You're back... Keeping things in order? Yep... what can I help you with?}
{118}{}{Here I am, enjoying this place... Well, actually I'm not. Anyway, what can I do for you?}
#backup generator down...
{119}{}{I've shut down the backup power generator. I'm heading down!}
#
{120}{}{What the...?! You dumb fuck. You're not going anywhere... Guards!!}
#
{121}{}{Oops... did I just say I was going to release that virus?}
#
{122}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
#
{123}{}{Alright. Be quick about it.}
