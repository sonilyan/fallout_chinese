#{100}{}{You see a man.}
{100}{}{你看到一个男人。}
#{150}{}{You see Gregory.}
{150}{}{你看到格雷戈里了。}
#{200}{}{You see a man, he's always scribbling something.}
{200}{}{你看一个男人，他总是乱涂乱画。}
#{250}{}{You see Gregory, the clerk of Sedit.}
{250}{}{你看看格雷戈里，赛迪特的职员。}
#{400}{}{Eehm... Police!}
{400}{}{嗯。。。警方！}
#{500}{}{[He continues to scribble something down. He doesn't even raise his head from the papers to look at you.] I'd say you got the wrong door. This is no public house, hotel or a guns shop, so please leave.}
{500}{}{[他继续乱涂乱画。他甚至不从报纸上抬起头看你]我得说你走错门了。这里没有公共场所、酒店或枪支商店，请离开。}
#{501}{}{What is this place, then?}
{501}{}{那这是什么地方？}
#{502}{}{Where can I find a bar?}
{502}{}{哪里有酒吧？}
#{503}{}{Where can I find a hotel?}
{503}{}{我在哪能找到旅馆？}
#{504}{}{Where can I find a shop selling weapons?}
{504}{}{哪里有卖武器的商店？}
#{505}{}{I apologize.}
{505}{}{我道歉。}
#{506}{}{Shmoodle!}
{506}{}{嘘！}
#{550}{}{A bar called Crater's been recently very popular with the people of your kind. They have the cheapest drinks. You can find it on Main Street. You just get out of here and go right along the street opposite to you. You can't miss it after that.}
{550}{}{最近有一家叫Crater的酒吧很受你们这种人的欢迎。他们有最便宜的饮料。你可以在大街上找到它。你只要离开这里，沿着你对面的街道走就行了。在那之后你不会错过的。}
#{551}{}{What do you mean, people of my kind?!}
{551}{}{你什么意思，我这种人？！}
#{552}{}{Thanks for the help.}
{552}{}{谢谢你的帮助。}
#{600}{}{You travel through the wasteland, sleep wherever the night catches you and you earn your living by doing what's available at the moment. Am I right?}
{600}{}{你在荒地里旅行，在夜幕降临的地方睡觉，你靠做当下可以得到的事情来谋生。我说得对吗？}
#{601}{}{Well, yes. So what?}
{601}{}{嗯，是的。那又怎么样？}
#{602}{}{Definitely not!}
{602}{}{绝对不是！}
#{650}{}{So nothing. I'm just telling you Crater's the place that should suit you.}
{650}{}{所以没什么。我只是告诉你火山口是适合你的地方。}
#{651}{}{I don't like the way you speak to me! I think I'll blow your brain out of your head.}
{651}{}{我不喜欢你跟我说话的方式！我想我会把你的脑袋打爆的。}
#{652}{}{I see, thanks for your help.}
{652}{}{我明白了，谢谢你的帮助。}
#{700}{}{Oh, really? That's interesting. I'm busy, though, and have no time to talk to you. Good-bye.}
{700}{}{哦，真的吗？那很有趣。不过，我很忙，没有时间和你说话。再见。}
#{701}{}{I don't like the way you speak to me! I think I'll blow your brain out of your head.}
{701}{}{我不喜欢你跟我说话的方式！我想我会把你的脑袋打爆的。}
#{702}{}{Good-bye.}
{702}{}{再见。}
#{750}{}{Gosh, please stop talking in that terrible wilderness lingo. You're in a town now, the police are right next door. It's true they're not a band of nice boys but I'm a respected citizen, important civil servant and clerk, in fact the only clerk in town and they won't let me get hurt in any way.}
{750}{}{天哪，请不要用那种可怕的荒野术语说话。你现在在城里，警察就在隔壁。他们确实不是一群好孩子，但我是一个受人尊敬的公民，重要的公务员和办事员，事实上是镇上唯一的办事员，他们不会让我受到任何伤害。}
#{751}{}{We'll see!}
{751}{}{我们拭目以待！}
#{752}{}{In that case, I'll be going.}
{752}{}{那样的话，我就走了。}
#{800}{}{If you get out of the door and turn left, you'll get to Little Hub, where you can find Falcon's Flight. It's a restaurant and hotel in one. I hope you don't mind the presence of ghouls. You can smell them in this hot climate over here, but that's not something you should be troubled about, I guess.}
{800}{}{如果你出了门向左拐，就到了小中心，在那里你可以找到猎鹰的航班。这是一个餐厅和酒店在一起。我希望你不介意有僵尸。在这里炎热的气候里你可以闻到它们的味道，但我想这不是你应该担心的。}
#{801}{}{You're trying to say I stink?! You'll pay for this!}
{801}{}{你想说我臭？！你要为此付出代价！}
#{802}{}{Well, thanks a lot.}
{802}{}{好吧，非常感谢。}
#{850}{}{Try Sabrina on Main Street. They say her weapons are the best. You just get out of here and go right along the street opposite to you. You can't miss it after that.}
{850}{}{试试大街上的萨布丽娜。他们说她的武器是最好的。你只要离开这里，沿着你对面的街道走就行了。在那之后你不会错过的。}
#{851}{}{Oh, thanks.}
{851}{}{哦，谢谢。}
#{900}{}{You could call it the town's administrative building. This is the place where town council meetings take place. At the same time it is my house and workplace. I am the chief and in fact the only town's clerk. My purpose is to provide records from the meetings and other things you would hardly understand. Unfortunately, I also have to provide basic information about the town.}
{900}{}{你可以称之为镇上的行政大楼。这是镇议会开会的地方。同时它也是我的家和工作场所。我是镇长，事实上是镇上唯一的办事员。我的目的是提供会议记录和其他你很难理解的东西。不幸的是，我还必须提供有关该镇的基本信息。}
#{901}{}{Great! I have some questions.}
{901}{}{太好了！我有一些问题。}

{956}{}{嘘！}
#{1000}{}{Oh, another impossible product of these terrible times. Please leave. Shoo, shoo!}
{1000}{}{哦，又是一个不可能的产物。请离开。嘘，嘘！}
#{1001}{}{Huh.}
{1001}{}{呵呵。}
#{1050}{}{[He sighs tiredly, stops writing and finally looks at you.] This town's name is Sedit, but you probably already know that, so what questions are you going to tire me with?}
{1050}{}{[他疲倦地叹了口气，停止写作，最后看着你]这个小镇的名字叫塞迪特，但你可能已经知道了，那你有什么问题要问我？}
#{1051}{}{What's the history of Sedit?}
{1051}{}{赛迪特有什么历史？}
#{1052}{}{Who runs the place?}
{1052}{}{谁经营这个地方？}
#{1053}{}{Where can I find work?}
{1053}{}{我在哪里能找到工作？}
#{1054}{}{What's in that cave to the north?}
{1054}{}{北边那个山洞里有什么？}
#{1055}{}{I've heard rumors a new sheriff's been elected, is that true?}
{1055}{}{我听说新警长当选了，是真的吗？}
#{1056}{}{You spend all your time in this building?}
{1056}{}{你把所有的时间都花在这栋楼里？}
#{1057}{}{Forget it.}
{1057}{}{算了吧。}
#{1058}{}{I think I saw a cave north from this quarter. What's in it?}
{1058}{}{我想我看到了北边的一个山洞。里面有什么？}
#{1059}{}{I think I saw a cave north from this quarter. What's in it?}
{1059}{}{我想我看到了北边的一个山洞。里面有什么？}
#{1100}{}{I don't know much about the period when no one kept any records and I doubt anyone will tell you much more. The town was created just like other towns do these days, it was built on pre-war ruins. There were conflicts at first, which is something that doesn't surprise me a bit in these primitive times. But I surely don't have to remind you of that. It was Nicol who managed to get a firm grip on things, if I may say it so. She established a caravan company and the police, mainly to protect the company.}
{1100}{}{我不太了解那段没有人保存任何记录的时期，我怀疑有人会告诉你更多。这座城镇是在战前的废墟上建立起来的，就像现在其他城镇一样。一开始有冲突，这在原始时代一点也不奇怪。但我不必提醒你。如果我可以这么说的话，是尼科尔设法牢牢控制住了局面。她成立了商队公司和警察，主要是为了保护公司。}
#{1101}{}{What happened then?}
{1101}{}{后来发生了什么？}
#{1102}{}{What town stood here before the war?}
{1102}{}{战前这里是哪个城镇？}
#{1103}{}{I have another question.}
{1103}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{1150}{}{As the town prospered thanks to its suitable location, there was greater demand for caravans. And where there's demand, supply will soon follow. Ehm, how to say it so you'll understand. Well, another caravan company was established ?? Frederyk's Dream. Sedit traded with lots of towns, our caravans traveled even to the distant Hub. Before that unfortunate thing happened.}
{1150}{}{由于地理位置优越，该镇繁荣发展，因此对商队的需求量更大。有需求的地方，很快就会有供应。嗯，怎么说才能让你明白。好吧，另一个商队公司成立了――弗雷德里克的梦想。塞迪特与许多城镇进行贸易，我们的商队甚至前往遥远的中心。在那不幸的事情发生之前。}
#{1151}{}{What thing?}
{1151}{}{什么东西？}
#{1152}{}{What cities?}
{1152}{}{什么城市？}
#{1153}{}{I have another question.}
{1153}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{1200}{}{Almost two years after our contacts with the Hub started, it was destroyed by a huge group of supermutants. Those dreadful creatures spread all over the wasteland after the Master's death, destroying whole towns. Lots of people that survived that attack, or ran away before it, settled here. They live in the quarter that's now called Little Hub on account of that. That's also where the third caravan company, the Crimson Caravan, is located. The Crimson Caravan was the most successful of the Hub's companies and with its destruction, its owners lost everything. They managed to take up a very strong position here nevertheless.}
{1200}{}{在我们与中心的接触开始近两年后，它被一大群超级变种人摧毁了。主人死后，那些可怕的生物遍布荒地，摧毁了整个城镇。很多在那次袭击中幸存下来的人，或者在袭击前逃跑的人，都定居在这里。他们住在现在被称为小中心的地区。这也是第三大篷车公司，深红大篷车所在地。深红色大篷车是最成功的枢纽公司和它的破坏，它的主人失去了一切。尽管如此，他们还是设法在这里占据了非常有利的地位。}
#{1201}{}{In what way?}
{1201}{}{以什么方式？}
#{1202}{}{Why did they decide to stay in distant Sedit?}
{1202}{}{他们为什么决定留在遥远的塞迪特？}
#{1203}{}{Interesting, but I have a different question.}
{1203}{}{有意思，但我有一个不同的问题。}
#{1250}{}{[He sighs wearily again.] I was hoping you knew at least something about the town, but I see that it was indeed a false hope. In order to prevent disputes or even fighting, the town council was established. Its purpose is to make decisions with relation to the town. Frederyk managed to influence its establishment, so now we have three council members, just as there are three caravan companies. Each caravan owner has one vote. Don't try to count them, I'll tell you right away it adds up to three votes, so in order to pass a decision, two votes are required.}
{1250}{}{[他又疲倦地叹了口气]我本希望你至少对这座城市有所了解，但我发现这确实是一个错误的希望。为了防止纠纷甚至打架，成立了镇议会。它的目的是作出与城镇有关的决定。弗雷德里克设法影响了它的建立，所以现在我们有三个理事会成员，就像有三个大篷车公司一样。每个房主有一票。别想数一数，我马上告诉你总共有三票，所以要通过一个决定，需要两票。}
#{1251}{}{Can you tell me more about the town council?}
{1251}{}{你能告诉我更多关于市议会的情况吗？}
#{1252}{}{I want to ask about something else.}
{1252}{}{我想问些别的事。}
#{1300}{}{How am I supposed to know? There's not even enough left of it for anyone to say what its name was. I presume it was some small town where two highways met.}
{1300}{}{我怎么知道？剩下的东西都不足以让人说出它的名字。我猜那是一个小镇，两条公路在那里交汇。}
#{1301}{}{I see, so what happened after the caravan company was established?}
{1301}{}{我明白了，那么商队公司成立后发生了什么？}
#{1302}{}{I see, I have another question.}
{1302}{}{我明白了，我还有一个问题。}
#{1350}{}{Didn't it occur to you to ask them about it? In fact no, it didn't. I'm sure they all had their reasons. For example so they would get away from the area threatened by mutants. Moreover, Sedit offered the same possibilities as the Hub. It's also been said that some felt threatened by an expansion of that area's organization known as the Brotherhood of Steel. But I don't know how much credit to give this, I'd not be happy to spread rumors.}
{1350}{}{你没想到要问他们这件事吗？事实上，没有。我相信他们都有自己的理由。例如，这样他们就可以逃离突变体威胁的地区。此外，Sedit提供了与Hub相同的可能性。也有人说，一些人感到威胁扩大该地区的组织称为钢铁兄弟会。但我不知道有多少功劳，我不乐意散布谣言。}
#{1351}{}{How did the Crimson Caravan secure a good position here?}
{1351}{}{深红色大篷车是如何在这里占据有利位置的？}
#{1352}{}{I have another question.}
{1352}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{1400}{}{At least some kind of order is kept by the police. But the decisions relating to the town are in the hands of the town council. They are also responsible for electing a new sheriff. Its members are the owners of the individual caravan companies.}
{1400}{}{至少警察维持了某种秩序。但有关该镇的决定权在市议会手中。他们还负责选举新警长。它的成员是各个商队公司的所有者。}
#{1401}{}{Where can I find the sheriff?}
{1401}{}{我在哪能找到警长？}
#{1402}{}{Can you tell me more about the town council?}
{1402}{}{你能告诉我更多关于市议会的情况吗？}
#{1403}{}{Interesting, but I have a different question.}
{1403}{}{有意思，但我有一个不同的问题。}
#{1450}{}{It's hard to miss that big wall surrounding the sheriff's plot where you can also find his villa. Very nice estate, not just a single small room such as I have to endure. The construction of that villa was ordered by the town council and is always the residence of the current sheriff, but the improvements it boasts were made by the current sheriff - Carpenter.}
{1450}{}{这是很难错过的大墙周围的警长的阴谋，你也可以找到他的别墅。很不错的庄园，不只是一间像我这样的小房间。这座别墅是由市议会下令建造的，一直是现任治安官的住所，但它所吹嘘的改进是由现任治安官卡彭特所做的。}
#{1451}{}{How do I get to him?}
{1451}{}{我怎么找到他？}
#{1452}{}{Interesting, but I have a different question.}
{1452}{}{有意思，但我有一个不同的问题。}
#{1500}{}{You? Bah, you'll hardly be able to get to him. If you have any business with the police, go the station and find the sheriff's deputy Tyler Morrow. I'm sure he'll be just as excited by your visit as I am.}
{1500}{}{你呢？呸，你很难找到他。如果你和警察有什么事，去警察局找副警长泰勒・莫罗。我相信他会和我一样对你的来访感到兴奋。}
#{1501}{}{Maybe I'll go see him but I still have some questions right now.}
{1501}{}{也许我会去看他，但我现在还有一些问题。}
#{1550}{}{As I've said, the members are all owners of caravan companies. Nicol from Sedit Caravan, Demetre from the Crimson Caravan and Frederyk from Frederyk's Dream. A decision is made by majority, so it's enough for two to agree. Still, to agree sometimes seems an unimaginable problem and so they only meet in exceptional cases. They met quite recently but it was after an extended period of time.}
{1550}{}{正如我所说，成员都是商队公司的老板。塞迪特商队的尼科尔，深红色商队的德米特里和弗雷德里克的梦中的弗雷德里克。一个决定是由多数人作出的，所以两个人同意就足够了。尽管如此，达成一致有时似乎是一个难以想象的问题，因此它们只在例外情况下才会相遇。他们是最近才见面的，但那是在很长一段时间之后。}
#{1551}{}{Why did they meet?}
{1551}{}{他们为什么见面？}
#{1552}{}{Interesting, but I have a different question.}
{1552}{}{有意思，但我有一个不同的问题。}
#{1600}{}{Falcon's Flight was becoming a frequent target of all sorts of attacks. It's horrible but not suprising, really. The police didn't show any interest so the council voted 2 to 1 for the sheriff to place special guards around Falcon's Flight to prevent these attacks.}
{1600}{}{猎鹰的飞行正成为各种攻击的频繁目标。这很可怕，但并不令人惊讶，真的。警方没有表现出任何兴趣，所以议会以2比1的票数通过了治安官在猎鹰的航班周围设置特别警卫以防止这些袭击。}
#{1601}{}{Who voted against?}
{1601}{}{谁投了反对票？}
#{1602}{}{I see, I have another question.}
{1602}{}{我明白了，我还有一个问题。}
#{1650}{}{Excuse me! I'm not in a position to provide you with such information.}
{1650}{}{请原谅我！我不能向你提供这样的信息。}
#{1651}{}{And what if I beat it out of you?}
{1651}{}{如果我打败你呢？}
#{1652}{}{I'm sorry, I'll ask about something else, then.}
{1652}{}{对不起，那我再问问别的事。}
#{1700}{}{Sedit is a caravan town, so how about you try asking at one of the caravan companies, hm? You already stink no better than a brahmin.}
{1700}{}{塞迪特是一个大篷车镇，你去问问其中一家大篷车公司怎么样？你已经臭得跟双头牛一样了。}
#{1701}{}{I don't like the way you speak to me! I think I'll shoot your brain out of your head.}
{1701}{}{我不喜欢你跟我说话的方式！我想我会把你的脑袋打爆的。}

#{1750}{}{You can find Frederyk's Dream on Short Lane, the Crimson Caravan in Little Hub, and Sedit Caravan have their headquarters directly on the Main Street. You just pick one and go see them, preferably right now.}
{1750}{}{你可以在短道上找到弗雷德里克的梦想，在小中心的深红色大篷车和塞迪特大篷车的总部就在大街上。你只要选一个去看他们，最好现在就去。}
#{1751}{}{Where do caravans travel?}

#{1752}{}{Great, I have another question.}

#{2252}{}{What happened to Frederyk?}
{2252}{}{弗雷德里克怎么了？}
#{2253}{}{How did Kevin get to run Sedit Caravan?}
{2253}{}{凯文是怎么经营塞迪特商队的？}
#{2254}{}{Interesting, but I have a different question.}
{2254}{}{有意思，但我有一个不同的问题。}
#{2300}{}{Oh, that's not a cave. It leads to the other side of those rocks. To a place we call the Lost Town. It's not really a part of the town, it's not governed by the police and it's mainly filled with lost souls. I guess I'm correct when I think you'll go there no matter what I tell you? Well, it might just be the place for you.}
{2300}{}{哦，那不是洞穴。它通向岩石的另一边。去一个我们称之为失落之城的地方。它不是镇上的一部分，也不受警察的控制，这里主要充满了迷失的灵魂。我想我是对的，不管我告诉你什么你都会去那里？好吧，那也许正是你的地方。}
#{2301}{}{Why do the police stay away from there?}
{2301}{}{为什么警察要远离那里？}
#{2302}{}{I see, I have another question.}
{2302}{}{我明白了，我还有一个问题。}
#{2350}{}{They say they wouldn't be able to keep the place in check due to a large number of hostile people, and its problematic access. It's quite a long way if you want to get in by going around the rocks, and the tunnel access is filled with deathclaws, so the police's only interest in the thing you call a cave is keeping deathclaws from coming out of it.}
{2350}{}{他们说他们无法控制这个地方，因为这里有很多敌对的人，而且出入不便。如果你想绕着岩石进去的话，这条路相当长，而且隧道通道里到处都是死爪，所以警察对你所说的洞穴唯一的兴趣就是不让死爪从里面出来。}
#{2351}{}{You don't sound like you actually believe that.}
{2351}{}{你听起来不像真的相信。}
#{2352}{}{I see, I have another question.}
{2352}{}{我明白了，我还有一个问题。}
#{2400}{}{I don't care how I sound. I'm not entitled to doubt what our police say and I don't mean to.}
{2400}{}{我不在乎我的声音。我无权怀疑我们警察说的话，我也不是有意的。}
#{2401}{}{I see, I have another question.}
{2401}{}{我明白了，我还有一个问题。}
#{2450}{}{Yes, that's true. Bruce Carpenter has died, most probably of heart attack. The town council unanimously voted Tyler Morrow, his deputy, the new sheriff. One of the companies wasn't interested in the election at all but they wouldn't have been able to change anything, anyway.}
{2450}{}{是的，没错。布鲁斯・卡彭特死了，很可能是心脏病发作。市议会一致选举他的副手泰勒・莫罗为新警长。其中一家公司对选举根本不感兴趣，但无论如何，他们也无法改变任何事情。}
#{2451}{}{Which company?}
{2451}{}{哪个公司？}
#{2452}{}{Interesting, I have another question.}
{2452}{}{有意思，我还有一个问题。}

#{2506}{}{You spend all your time in this building?}
{2506}{}{你把所有的时间都花在这栋楼里？}
#{2507}{}{With nothing.}
{2507}{}{一无所有。}
#{2550}{}{I spend most of my time here or in my personal room at the back of the house. I don't understand why you're asking.}
{2550}{}{我大部分时间都呆在这里或房子后面的私人房间里。我不明白你为什么这么问。}
#{2551}{}{There've been some people here quite recently, but not you.}
{2551}{}{最近这里有些人，但不是你。}
#{2552}{}{Interesting, I have another question.}
{2552}{}{有意思，我还有一个问题。}
#{2600}{}{Impossible. But now that you mention it, Nicol recently asked me to clear the premises, she had some kind of private meeting in here. I hope you didn't waste her time. I can see you're very capable of doing that.}
{2600}{}{不可能的。但既然你提到了，尼科尔最近让我清理了房间，她在这里开了个私人会议。我希望你没有浪费她的时间。我看得出你很有能力做到这一点。}
#{2601}{}{I don't need to know more, I'll ask about something else.}
{2601}{}{我不需要知道更多，我会问其他的。}
#{2650}{}{Impossible. But now that you mention it, Nicol recently asked me to clear the premises, she had some kind of private meeting in here. I hope you didn't waste her time. I can see you're very capable of doing that.}

{2807}{}{我不喜欢你跟我说话的方式！我想我会把你的脑袋打爆的。}
#{2808}{}{Forget it.}
{2808}{}{算了吧。}
#{2850}{}{[He sighs tiredly, stops writing and finally looks at you. His expression suddenly changes to a friendly one.] Oh, hello, welcome to Sedit. My name is Gregory, can I know the name you go by?}
{2850}{}{[他疲倦地叹了口气，停止了写作，最后看着你。他的表情突然变得友好起来。]哦，你好，欢迎来到赛迪特。我叫格雷戈里，你叫什么名字？}
#{2851}{}{Uh, my name's }
{2851}{}{呃，我叫}
#{2852}{}{My name's not important.}
{2852}{}{我的名字不重要。}
#{2900}{}{Still, I'd like to know it.}
{2900}{}{不过，我还是很想知道。}
#{2901}{}{Very well then, my name's }
{2901}{}{很好，我叫}
#{2902}{}{Just forget about my name, got it?!}
{2902}{}{忘了我的名字，明白吗？！}
#{2950}{}{Oh, I was simply trying to be polite. You seemed like a very nice man, but I guess I was wrong. What is it you want, then?}
{2950}{}{哦，我只是想礼貌一点。你看起来是个很好的人，但我想我错了。那你想要什么？}

{2957}{}{我不喜欢你跟我说话的方式！我想我会把你的脑袋打爆的。}
#{2958}{}{Forget it.}
{2958}{}{算了吧。}
#{3000}{}{Nice name, nice like you. It's a pleasure to meet you. Why don't we put the questions aside? I'd like if the two of us could get to know each other better, if you're interested.}
{3000}{}{名字不错，很像你。很高兴见到你。我们为什么不把问题放在一边？如果你感兴趣的话，我想我们俩能不能更好地了解对方。}
#{3001}{}{I think I'll ask about the history of Sedit, instead.}
{3001}{}{我想我应该问问赛迪的历史。}
#{3002}{}{I'm more interested in who's in charge in the town.}
{3002}{}{我更感兴趣的是镇上谁负责。}
#{3003}{}{Could you tell me where to find a job instead?}
{3003}{}{你能告诉我在哪里找工作吗？}
#{3004}{}{I'm actually more interested in that cave to the north. What's inside?}
{3004}{}{我其实对北边的那个山洞更感兴趣。里面是什么？}
#{3005}{}{People say a new sheriff's been elected, is that true?}
{3005}{}{有人说新警长当选了，是真的吗？}
#{3006}{}{You spend all your time in this building?}
{3006}{}{你把所有的时间都花在这栋楼里？}
#{3007}{}{Getting to know you better sounds good. What exactly do you have in mind?}
{3007}{}{更好地了解你听起来不错。你到底在想什么？}
#{3008}{}{Ehm, maybe some other time.}
{3008}{}{嗯，也许改天吧。}
#{3009}{}{I'm actually more interested in that cave I think I saw north from this quarter. What's in it?}
{3009}{}{实际上我对这个洞更感兴趣，我想我是从这个季度看到的。里面有什么？}
#{3050}{}{I don't know much about the period when no one kept any records and I doubt anyone will tell you much more. The town was created just like other towns do these days, it was built on pre-war ruins. There were conflicts at first, which is something that doesn't surprise me a bit in these primitive times. It's horrible. It was Nicol who managed to get a firm grip on things, if I may say it so. She established a caravan company and the police, mainly to protect the company.}
{3050}{}{我不太了解那段没有人保存任何记录的时期，我怀疑有人会告诉你更多。这座城镇是在战前的废墟上建立起来的，就像现在其他城镇一样。一开始有冲突，这在原始时代一点也不奇怪。太可怕了。如果我可以这么说的话，是尼科尔设法牢牢控制住了局面。她成立了商队公司和警察，主要是为了保护公司。}
#{3051}{}{What happened then?}
{3051}{}{后来发生了什么？}
#{3052}{}{What town stood here before the war?}
{3052}{}{战前这里是哪个城镇？}
#{3053}{}{I have another question.}
{3053}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{3100}{}{As the town prospered thanks to its suitable location, there was greater demand for caravans. And where there's demand, supply will soon follow and so another caravan company saw the day of light ?? Frederyk's Dream. Sedit traded with lots of towns, our caravans traveled even to the distant Hub. Before that unfortunate thing happened.}
{3100}{}{由于地理位置优越，该镇繁荣发展，因此对商队的需求量更大。有需求的地方，很快就会有供应，于是另一家商队公司看到了光明之日――弗雷德里克的梦想。塞迪特与许多城镇进行贸易，我们的商队甚至前往遥远的中心。在那不幸的事情发生之前。}
#{3101}{}{What thing?}
{3101}{}{什么东西？}
#{3102}{}{What cities?}
{3102}{}{什么城市？}
#{3103}{}{I have another question.}
{3103}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{3150}{}{Almost two years after our contacts with the Hub started, it was destroyed by a huge group of supermutants. Those dreadful creatures spread all over the wasteland after the Master's death, destroying whole towns. Lots of people that survived that attack or ran away before it settled here. They live in the quarter that's now called Little Hub on account of that. That's also where the third caravan company ?? the Crimson Caravan ?? is located. The Crimson Caravan was the most successful of the Hub's companies and with its destruction, its owners lost everything. They managed to take up a very strong position here nevertheless.}
{3150}{}{在我们与中心的接触开始近两年后，它被一大群超级变种人摧毁了。主人死后，那些可怕的生物遍布荒地，摧毁了整个城镇。很多人在那次袭击中幸存下来或者在袭击发生之前逃跑了。他们住在现在被称为小中心的地区。这也是第三大篷车公司“深红篷车”所在地。深红色大篷车是最成功的枢纽公司和它的破坏，它的主人失去了一切。尽管如此，他们还是设法在这里占据了非常有利的地位。}
#{3151}{}{In what way?}
{3151}{}{以什么方式？}
#{3152}{}{Why did they decide to stay in the distant Sedit?}
{3152}{}{为什么他们决定留在遥远的塞迪特？}
#{3153}{}{Interesting, but I have a different question.}
{3153}{}{有意思，但我有一个不同的问题。}
#{3200}{}{I'm surprised someone hasn't told you already. Some people are impossibly rude. So, in order to prevent conflicts or even fighting, the town council was established. Its purpose is to make decisions with relation to the town. Frederyk managed to influence its establishment, so now we have three council members, just as there are three caravan companies. Each caravan owner has one vote, so two votes are required to pass a decision.}
{3200}{}{我很惊讶有人还没告诉你。有些人非常粗鲁。因此，为了防止冲突甚至战斗，成立了镇议会。它的目的是作出与城镇有关的决定。弗雷德里克设法影响了它的建立，所以现在我们有三个理事会成员，就像有三个大篷车公司一样。每个房主有一票，所以要通过一个决定需要两票。}
#{3201}{}{Can you tell me more about the town council?}
{3201}{}{你能告诉我更多关于市议会的情况吗？}
#{3202}{}{I want to ask about something else.}
{3202}{}{我想问些别的事。}
#{3250}{}{I'm very sorry but I have no idea. There's not even enough left of it for anyone to say what its name was. I presume it was some small town where two highways met.}
{3250}{}{很抱歉，我不知道。剩下的东西都不足以让人说出它的名字。我猜那是一个小镇，两条公路在那里交汇。}
#{3251}{}{I see, so what happened after the caravan company was established?}
{3251}{}{我明白了，那么商队公司成立后发生了什么？}
#{3252}{}{I see, I have another question.}
{3252}{}{我明白了，我还有一个问题。}
#{3300}{}{I'm sure they all had their reasons. For example so they would get away from the area threatened by mutants. Moreover, Sedit offered same possibilities as the Hub. It's also been said that some felt threatened by an expansion of that area's organization known as the Brotherhood of Steel. But I don't know how much credit to give this, I'd not be happy to mislead you with false information.}
{3300}{}{我相信他们都有自己的理由。例如，这样他们就可以逃离突变体威胁的地区。此外，Sedit提供了与Hub相同的可能性。也有人说，一些人感到威胁扩大该地区的组织称为钢铁兄弟会。但我不知道有多少功劳给这个，我不会高兴地误导你与虚假信息。}
#{3301}{}{How did the Crimson Caravan secure a good position here?}
{3301}{}{深红色大篷车是如何在这里占据有利位置的？}
#{3302}{}{Fine, I have another question.}
{3302}{}{好吧，我还有一个问题。}
#{3350}{}{The decisions relating to town are in the hands of the three members of the town council. They are also responsible for electing a new sheriff. Its members are the owners of the individual caravan companies. The role of the police then is to secure order. To be honest, they mainly tend to protect those who pay them well. But do not worry, you're safe with me, I'm very important for the town.}
{3350}{}{有关城镇的决定权在镇议会的三名成员手中。他们还负责选举新警长。它的成员是各个商队公司的所有者。警察的职责就是维持秩序。老实说，他们主要倾向于保护那些给他们高薪的人。但别担心，你和我在一起很安全，我对镇上很重要。}
#{3351}{}{Where can I find the sheriff?}
{3351}{}{我在哪能找到警长？}
#{3352}{}{Can you tell me more about the town council?}
{3352}{}{你能告诉我更多关于市议会的情况吗？}
#{3353}{}{Interesting, but I have a different question.}
{3353}{}{有意思，但我有一个不同的问题。}
#{3400}{}{The sheriff lives in a beautiful villa behind that large wall. Very nice estate. I only have one small room, but it's very cozy. [He winks at you.] The building of that villa was ordered by the town council and is always the residence of the current sheriff, but the improvements it boasts were made by the current sheriff - Carpenter.}
{3400}{}{治安官住在那堵大墙后面一栋漂亮的别墅里。很不错的庄园。我只有一个小房间，但很舒适。[他向你眨了眨眼]那栋别墅是镇议会下令建造的，一直是现任警长的住所，但它吹嘘的改进是由现任警长卡彭特完成的。}
#{3401}{}{How do I get to him?}
{3401}{}{我怎么找到他？}
#{3402}{}{Interesting, but I have a different question.}
{3402}{}{有意思，但我有一个不同的问题。}
#{3450}{}{It's nearly impossible to get to him and it's not worth the trouble, anyway. If you have any business with the police, you can visit the police station where you'll find the sheriff's deputy, Tyler Morrow, but I wouldn't recommend this option. Morrow isn't a very friendly person. You'd do better to stay here.}
{3450}{}{要找到他几乎是不可能的，无论如何，这也不值得费心。如果你和警察有什么关系，你可以去警察局找副警长泰勒・莫罗，但我不建议你这样做。莫罗不是一个很友好的人。你最好呆在这儿。}
#{3451}{}{We'll see, I have a few more questions first.}
{3451}{}{我们拭目以待，我还有几个问题要问。}
#{3500}{}{As I've said, the members are all owners of caravan companies. Nicol from Sedit Caravan, Demetre from the Crimson Caravan and Frederyk from Frederyk's Dream. A decision is made by majority, so it's enough for two to agree. Still, to agree sometimes seems an unimaginable problem and so they only meet in exceptional cases. They met quite recently but it was after an extended period of time.}
{3500}{}{正如我所说，成员都是商队公司的老板。塞迪特商队的尼科尔，深红色商队的德米特里和弗雷德里克的梦中的弗雷德里克。一个决定是由多数人作出的，所以两个人同意就足够了。尽管如此，达成一致有时似乎是一个难以想象的问题，因此它们只在例外情况下才会相遇。他们是最近才见面的，但那是在很长一段时间之后。}
#{3501}{}{What happened?}
{3501}{}{怎么搞的？}
#{3502}{}{Interesting, but I have a different question.}
{3502}{}{有意思，但我有一个不同的问题。}
#{3550}{}{Falcon's Flight was becoming a frequent target of all sorts of attacks. It's horrible but not suprising, really. The police didn't show any interest so the council voted 2 to 1 for sheriff to place special guards around Falcon's Flight to prevent these attacks.}
{3550}{}{猎鹰的飞行正成为各种攻击的频繁目标。这很可怕，但并不令人惊讶，真的。警方没有表现出任何兴趣，所以议会以2比1的票数通过了治安官在猎鹰的航班周围设置特别警卫以防止这些袭击。}
#{3551}{}{Who voted against?}
{3551}{}{谁投了反对票？}
#{3552}{}{I see, I have another question.}
{3552}{}{我明白了，我还有一个问题。}
#{3600}{}{I'm very sorry but I'm not entitled to provide such information.}
{3600}{}{很抱歉，我无权提供这些信息。}
#{3601}{}{What if I ask you very nicely?}
{3601}{}{如果我很客气地问你呢？}
#{3602}{}{I'll ask about something else, then.}
{3602}{}{那我再问问别的事。}
#{3650}{}{Well, fine, if you insist. It was Demetre from the Crimson Caravan, he's not particularly fond of ghouls.}
{3650}{}{好吧，如果你坚持的话。那是深红色大篷车里的德米特里，他不是特别喜欢僵尸。}
#{3651}{}{There's something else I'd like to know about.}
{3651}{}{还有件事我想知道。}
#{3700}{}{Sedit is a caravan town, so you'd do best to ask at one of the caravan companies. Working as a caravan guard is very dangerous, though. You should be very careful.}
{3700}{}{塞迪特是一个大篷车镇，所以你最好去一家大篷车公司问问。不过，当商队警卫是非常危险的。你应该非常小心。}
#{3701}{}{Which companies are those and where do I find them?}
{3701}{}{这些是哪些公司？我在哪里可以找到它们？}
#{3702}{}{Where do the caravans travel?}
{3702}{}{商队在哪里旅行？}
#{3703}{}{No worries. There's something else I want to ask about.}
{3703}{}{别担心。我还有件事要问。}
#{3750}{}{You can find Frederyk's Dream on Short Lane, the Crimson Caravan in Little Hub, and Sedit Caravan have their headquarters directly on the Main Street.}
{3750}{}{你可以在短道上找到弗雷德里克的梦想，在小中心的深红色大篷车和塞迪特大篷车的总部就在大街上。}
#{3751}{}{Where do the caravans travel?}
{3751}{}{商队在哪里旅行？}
#{3752}{}{Great, I have another question.}
{3752}{}{太好了，我还有一个问题。}

#{3804}{}{I have another question.}
{3804}{}{我还有一个问题。}
#{3850}{}{I'm very sorry but I have no idea. And it certainly wouldn't be a good idea trying to find out, you'd do better to stay here.}
{3850}{}{很抱歉，我不知道。你最好呆在这里，想办法弄清楚这一点肯定不是个好主意。}
#{3851}{}{Can you show me their locations on the map?}
{3851}{}{你能告诉我他们在地图上的位置吗？}
#{3852}{}{I'll ask about something else, then.}
{3852}{}{那我再问问别的事。}
#{3900}{}{Of course I can. Your wish is my command. [He points on the map.] This is Corath and this is Albuquerque.}

{4051}{}{嗯，谢谢。我想问些别的事。}
#{4100}{}{As I've said, the members are all owners of caravan companies. Nicol from Sedit Caravan, Demetre from the Crimson Caravan and Frederyk from Frederyk's Dream. A decision is made by majority, so it's enough for two to agree. Still, to agree sometimes seems an unimaginable problem and so they only meet in exceptional cases. They met quite recently but it was after an extended period of time. Oh, I almost forgot, Sedit Caravan's recently been taken over by Kevin.}
{4100}{}{正如我所说，成员都是商队公司的老板。塞迪特商队的尼科尔，深红色商队的德米特里和弗雷德里克的梦中的弗雷德里克。一个决定是由多数人作出的，所以两个人同意就足够了。尽管如此，达成一致有时似乎是一个难以想象的问题，因此它们只在例外情况下才会相遇。他们是最近才见面的，但那是在很长一段时间之后。哦，我差点忘了，塞迪特车队最近被凯文接管了。}
#{4101}{}{What happened?}
{4101}{}{怎么搞的？}
#{4102}{}{How did Kevin get to run Sedit Caravan?}
{4102}{}{凯文是怎么经营塞迪特商队的？}
#{4103}{}{Interesting, but I have a different question.}
{4103}{}{有意思，但我有一个不同的问题。}
#{4150}{}{That's their internal business. Even the police don't meddle with that so it's better to keep away from asking questions about that.}
{4150}{}{那是他们的内部事务。即使是警察也不会插手这件事，所以最好不要问这个问题。}
#{4151}{}{Thanks for the tip. I have another question.}
{4151}{}{谢谢你的小费。我还有一个问题。}

Moreover, Kevin's now in charge of Sedit Caravan now.}
{4200}{}{正如我所说，成员都是商队公司的老板。塞迪特商队的尼科尔，深红色商队的德米特里和弗雷德里克的梦中的弗雷德里克。一个决定是由多数人作出的，所以两个人同意就足够了。尽管如此，达成一致有时似乎是一个难以想象的问题，因此它们只在例外情况下才会相遇。他们是最近才见面的，但那是在很长一段时间之后。哦，我差点忘了。现在，在弗雷德里克可怕的死后，蒂姆掌管着他的公司。而且，凯文现在负责塞迪特商队。}
#{4201}{}{What happened?}
{4201}{}{怎么搞的？}
#{4202}{}{What happened to Frederyk?}
{4202}{}{弗雷德里克怎么了？}
#{4203}{}{How did Kevin get to run Sedit Caravan?}
{4203}{}{凯文是怎么经营塞迪特商队的？}
#{4204}{}{Interesting, but I have a different question.}
{4204}{}{有意思，但我有一个不同的问题。}
#{4250}{}{Oh, that's not a cave. It leads to the other side of those rocks. To a place we call the Lost Town. It's not really a part of the town, it's not governed by the police and it's mainly filled with lost souls. Terrible place, steer clear from it.}
{4250}{}{哦，那不是洞穴。它通向岩石的另一边。去一个我们称之为失落之城的地方。它不是镇上的一部分，也不受警察的控制，这里主要充满了迷失的灵魂。可怕的地方，远离它。}
#{4251}{}{Why do the police stay away from there?}
{4251}{}{为什么警察要远离那里？}
#{4252}{}{I see, I have another question.}
{4252}{}{我明白了，我还有一个问题。}
#{4300}{}{They say they wouldn't be able to keep the place in check due to a large number of hostile people, and its problematic access. It's quite a long way if you want to get in by going around the rocks, and the tunnel access is filled with deathclaws, so the police's only interest in the tunnel is keeping deathclaws from coming out of it.}
{4300}{}{他们说他们无法控制这个地方，因为这里有很多敌对的人，而且出入不便。如果你想绕着岩石进去的话，这条路相当长，而且隧道通道里到处都是死爪，所以警察对隧道唯一的兴趣就是不让死爪从里面出来。}
#{4301}{}{That sounds like a feeble excuse.}
{4301}{}{那听起来像是个无力的借口。}
#{4302}{}{I see, I have another question.}
{4302}{}{我明白了，我还有一个问题。}
#{4350}{}{I have the same opinion, but don't speak about it aloud, I wouldn't want anything to happen to you. A man they call senor Rodriguez rules the Lost Town and it's quite possible he bribes the police to leave him alone. It's best not to show interest and stay as far away from the Lost Town as possible.}
{4350}{}{我也有同样的意见，但不要大声说出来，我不想你出什么事。一个被称为罗德里格斯参议员的人统治着这个失落的小镇，他很有可能贿赂警察让他一个人呆着。最好不要表现出兴趣，尽量远离失落的小镇。}
#{4351}{}{Fine, I want to ask about something else.}
{4351}{}{好吧，我想问点别的。}
#{4400}{}{Yes, that's true. Bruce Carpenter has died, most probably of heart attack. The town council unanimously voted Tyler Morrow, his deputy, the new sheriff. One of the companies wasn't interested in the election at all but they wouldn't have been able to change anything, anyway.}
{4400}{}{是的，没错。布鲁斯・卡彭特死了，很可能是心脏病发作。市议会一致选举他的副手泰勒・莫罗为新警长。其中一家公司对选举根本不感兴趣，但无论如何，他们也无法改变任何事情。}
#{4401}{}{Which company?}
{4401}{}{哪个公司？}
#{4402}{}{Interesting, I have another question.}
{4402}{}{有意思，我还有一个问题。}
#{4450}{}{I'm very sorry but I'm not entitled to provide such information.}
{4450}{}{很抱歉，我无权提供这些信息。}
#{4451}{}{What if I ask you very nicely?}
{4451}{}{如果我很客气地问你呢？}
#{4452}{}{I'll ask about something else, then.}
{4452}{}{那我再问问别的事。}
#{4500}{}{Well, fine, if you insist. It was the Crimson Caravan. They showed no interest in the election of the new sheriff.}
{4500}{}{好吧，如果你坚持的话。那是一辆深红色的大篷车。他们对新警长的选举不感兴趣。}
#{4501}{}{Thanks. I have another question.}
{4501}{}{谢谢。我还有一个问题。}
#{4550}{}{Of course, I spend most of my time here or in my personal room at the back of the house. You can come visit me anytime you wish, I'd be delighted to have you.}
{4550}{}{当然，我大部分时间都在这里或是在房子后面的私人房间里度过。你可以随时来看我，我很高兴见到你。}
#{4551}{}{I've been here recently and there were some people here, but not you.}
{4551}{}{我最近来过这里，这里有一些人，但不是你。}
#{4552}{}{I see, can I have another question?}
{4552}{}{我明白了，我能再问一个问题吗？}
#{4600}{}{Hm, that's not possible. But now that you mention it, Nicol recently asked me to clear the premises, she had some kind of private meeting in here. I hope she wasn't very rude to you, since you disturbed her from something very important. Don't worry, meetings like that happen very rarely here.}
{4600}{}{嗯，那不可能。但既然你提到了，尼科尔最近让我清理了房间，她在这里开了个私人会议。我希望她对你不是很粗鲁，因为你打扰了她一些非常重要的事情。别担心，这样的会议在这里很少发生。}
#{4601}{}{I don't need to know more, I'll ask about something else.}

#{5250}{}{Just a boring dirty farmer, but thanks to the place where he lives, he's frequently the first person in Sedit newcomers get to see.

At least he spares me some work, this way I don't get that many of those dull people in here.}
