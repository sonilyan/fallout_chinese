### {100}{}{[As you walk inside, the first thing you notice is a big gun barrel pointed at your head.] What the hell are you doing here? I almost fried your sorry ass!}
{100}{}{[当你走进来的时候，你首先注意到的是一个大枪管指着你的头。]你在这里干什么？我差点炸了你的屁股！}
### {101}{}{What's going on here?}
{101}{}{这是怎么回事？}
### {102}{}{Do you mind... moving that thing off my face, please?}
{102}{}{你介意吗。。。请把那东西从我脸上移开？}
### {103}{}{Back off buddy, I ain't telling you shit!}
{103}{}{退后，伙计，我不会告诉你的！}
### {104}{}{Have you been living under a rock... Hey wait. [Looking closely at you.] You must be that newcomer... Jerry said a few things about you. [He puts down the gun.] Sorry about that, formality, you know... Say, how did you get past those things?}
{104}{}{你一直生活在岩石下吗。。。嘿，等等。[仔细看你。]你一定是那个新来的。。。杰瑞说了一些关于你的事。[他放下枪。]很抱歉，拘谨，你知道。。。比方说，你是怎么克服这些事情的？}
### {105}{}{Well, I killed them...}
{105}{}{我杀了他们。。。}
### {106}{}{Well, I managed to sneak past them...}
{106}{}{嗯，我设法从他们身边溜走了。。。}
### {107}{}{Damn, you shouldn't have done that. You see I am, hmm... was... conducting some research on deathclaw migration. Jerry asked me to track down the individuals, find patterns in their movement, anything that could lead us to their nest. Of course, we'll put them down eventually because they are too close to our homes to be ignored. [He looks at you.] Don't worry, more will come, however, it's very important that I finish my work before they start coming in much greater numbers.}
{107}{}{该死，你不该那样做。你看我是，嗯…曾经。。。对死亡爪迁徙进行一些研究。杰瑞让我追踪这些个体，找到它们的运动模式，任何能把我们带到它们巢穴的东西。当然，我们最终会把它们放下，因为它们离我们家太近了，不容忽视。[他看着你。]别担心，还会有更多的人来，但是，在他们开始大量到来之前，我完成我的工作是非常重要的。}
### {108}{}{I understand. Tell me what happened here.}
{108}{}{我理解。告诉我这里发生了什么。}
### {109}{}{Old story... You see, miners used to live in these buildings. This was once a densely populated area but since the mine became more and more dangerous to work at, and some say it also got unprofitable, people started leaving, searching for a better life. Sadly, most of them failed...}
{109}{}{老故事。。。你看，矿工以前住在这些建筑里。这曾经是一个人口稠密的地区，但由于矿山工作变得越来越危险，有些人说它也无利可图，人们开始离开，寻找更好的生活。遗憾的是，他们大多数都失败了。。。}
### {110}{}{Why?}
{110}{}{为什么？}
### {111}{}{I see, thanks for the story.}
{111}{}{我明白了，谢谢你的故事。}
### {112}{}{You could ask them the same question but I doubt they will hear you. Because they are dead, that's why!}
{112}{}{你可以问他们同样的问题，但我怀疑他们会听到你的。因为他们已经死了，这就是为什么！}
### {113}{}{Oh, sorry, I didn't know that.}
{113}{}{哦，对不起，我不知道。}
### {114}{}{Don't be, I had a lot of time to deal with the loss. Now it's time to move on and make sure things get better or at least try not to make them any worse. See you later, I have to finish some reports.}
{114}{}{别这样，我有很多时间来处理这次损失。现在是时候继续前进了，确保事情变得更好，或者至少不要让事情变得更糟。回头见，我得完成一些报告。}
### {115}{}{Sure thing.}
{115}{}{当然可以}
### {116}{}{What if I don't... Who are you?}
{116}{}{如果我不。。。你是谁？}
### {117}{}{Well, I'm a traveler from the north.}
{117}{}{嗯，我是一个来自北方的旅行者。}
### {118}{}{It's none of your damn business!}
{118}{}{这不关你的事！}
### {119}{}{Then you need to know that this is a restricted area and... Hey, wait a second! [Looking closely at you.] You must be that newcomer... Jerry said a few things about you. [He puts down the gun.] Sorry about that, formality, you know... Say, how did you get past those things?}
{119}{}{然后你需要知道这是一个禁区。。。嘿，等一下！[仔细看你。]你一定是那个新来的。。。杰瑞说了一些关于你的事。[他放下枪。]很抱歉，拘谨，你知道。。。比方说，你是怎么克服这些事情的？}
### {120}{}{It wasn't easy but I killed them.}
{120}{}{这并不容易，但我杀了他们。}
### {121}{}{Well, I managed to sneak past them...}
{121}{}{嗯，我设法从他们身边溜走了。。。}
### {122}{}{Well, I have my ways.}
{122}{}{好吧，我有我的方式。}
### {123}{}{Yeah right, and what about those noises I've heard?}
{123}{}{是的，对，我听到的那些噪音呢？}
### {124}{}{Uh... self-defense?}
{124}{}{嗯自卫？}
### {125}{}{Nice to see you again but you should avoid this place in the future. I have a very important research project to work on.}
{125}{}{很高兴再次见到你，但你以后应该避开这个地方。我有一个非常重要的研究项目要做。}
### {126}{}{Can I ask you something?}
{126}{}{我能问你点什么吗？}
### {127}{}{Oh, sure.}
{127}{}{哦，当然。}
### {128}{}{Alright, just be quick about it!}
{128}{}{好吧，快一点！}
### {129}{}{Tell me about this place. Why is it in ruins?}
{129}{}{告诉我这个地方的情况。为什么它成了废墟？}
### {130}{}{What do you do here?}
{130}{}{你在这里做什么？}
### {131}{}{On second thought, there's nothing I need to know right now.}
{131}{}{转念一想，我现在没有什么需要知道的。}
### {132}{}{I am conducting research on deathclaw migration. Jerry asked me to track down the individuals, find their movement pattern and trace it back to the source. You see, eventually, we will have to clean out their nest, wherever it is. [Shakes his head.] All this time they've been breeding and pushing further out, right up to the city limits. If we wait any longer they will start pushing over our homes. Once that happens, there may be no stopping them. That's why it's so important that I finish my work in time.}
{132}{}{我正在进行关于死亡爪迁徙的研究。杰瑞让我追踪这些人，找到他们的运动模式，并追溯到源头。你看，最终，我们将不得不清理它们的巢穴，无论它在哪里。[摇头。]一直以来，它们都在繁殖，并向更远的地方推进，一直到城市的边界。如果我们再等下去，他们就会把我们的房子推倒。一旦发生这种情况，可能无法阻止他们。这就是为什么我及时完成工作如此重要的原因。}
### {133}{}{What happened to the people that used to live here?}
{133}{}{以前住在这里的人怎么了？}
### {134}{}{I'll be going now, thanks for your time.}
{134}{}{我现在就走，谢谢你抽出时间。}
### {135}{}{Miners used to live here. This was once a densely populated area but since the mine became a real working hazard and some say it also got, well, unprofitable, people started to leave town, searching for a better life. Sadly, most of them ended up dead, as we later learned. Some were robbed and killed by raiders while others died of starvation and lack of medical supplies... Either way, a horrible way to end up in the wasteland.}
{135}{}{矿工以前住在这里。这曾经是一个人口稠密的地区，但由于矿井成为一个真正的工作危险，有人说它也变得无利可图，人们开始离开小镇，寻找更好的生活。不幸的是，正如我们后来了解到的那样，他们中的大多数人最终都死了。一些人被袭击者抢劫致死，而另一些人则死于饥饿和缺乏医疗用品。。。不管怎样，这都是一种可怕的结局。}
### {136}{}{Indeed, thanks for the story.}
{136}{}{的确，谢谢你的故事。}
### {137}{}{[Surprised.] I'll be damned. Either you have some serious skills or a stealth boy to waste. I'm impressed. You see, I am tracking these beasts as part of a research project Jerry asked me to do. That is to track down the individuals, find their movement patterns across this area and locate their nest. They have come too close to our homes to be ignored any longer. We need a permanent solution. And we'll need it fast, before they come in numbers we can't handle anymore.}
{137}{}{[惊讶]我会被诅咒的。要么你有一些严肃的技能，要么浪费一个隐秘的男孩。我印象深刻。你看，我正在追踪这些野兽，这是杰瑞让我做的一个研究项目的一部分。那就是追踪这些动物，找到它们在这个地区的运动模式，并找到它们的巢穴。它们离我们的家太近了，再也不能被忽视了。我们需要一个永久的解决方案。我们需要尽快，在他们出现我们无法再应付的人数之前。}
