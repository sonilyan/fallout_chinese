### {202}{}{During the treatment, you were distrustful of pre-war medicine. Why?}
{202}{}{在治疗过程中，你不信任战前的药物。为什么？}
### {203}{}{Our ancestors always taught us not to trust the things of the Old World. They said that these things were cursed by spirits and carried danger. But one of them just saved my life. Now I'm thinking, won't I be cursed?}
{203}{}{我们的祖先总是教导我们不要相信旧世界的东西。他们说这些东西被鬼魂诅咒，带有危险。但其中一个救了我的命。现在我在想，我不会被诅咒吗？}
### {204}{}{But you're still alive. Now rest.}
{204}{}{但你还活着。现在休息。}
### {205}{}{This stranger, of course, knows his business. And I've never been so fresh after an illness! But the ancestors always taught that you can't trust the things and traditions of the Old World. Now everyone will think that I am cursed by spirits!}
{205}{}{这个陌生人当然知道他的事。我从来没有在生病后如此精神抖擞！但祖先总是教导我们不能相信旧世界的事物和传统。现在每个人都会认为我被鬼魂诅咒了！}

### {207}{}{How do you feel after treatment?}
{207}{}{治疗后你感觉如何？}

{208}{}{我以为我完了。但现在一切都好了。你正在创造真正的奇迹。毕竟，别墅里骨折的人很少能活下来。我们以前怎么没注意到你有这个礼物？}

{209}{}{最重要的是你还活着。现在休息。}

### {210}{}{What do you know about the world outside the Villa?}
{210}{}{你对别墅外的世界了解多少？}
### {211}{}{Not much. All my life I have not been further from our desert. And I don't regret it at all. Talk to Jose, he knows something, because he occasionally does business with strangers.}
{211}{}{不多在我的一生中，我从未远离过我们的沙漠。我一点也不后悔。和何塞谈谈，他知道一些事情，因为他偶尔会和陌生人做生意。}
### {212}{}{I'm going on a trip. How can you help me?}
{212}{}{我要去旅行。你能帮我什么？}
### {213}{}{As you can see, I'm of little use. But I can give you this (takes out a handful of cartridges of different calibers). One of the raiders dropped it during the assault, and I hid it. I hope you'll find this useful.}
{213}{}{正如你所看到的，我没什么用。但我可以给你这个（拿出一把不同口径的子弹）。一个袭击者在袭击中扔了它，我把它藏了起来。我希望你会发现这很有用。}
### {214}{}{Thank you.}
{214}{}{非常感谢。}
### {215}{}{Do you know those who have been outside the Villa?}
{215}{}{你认识那些出过别墅的人吗？}
### {216}{}{What are you! Who in their right mind would leave their home and go to the hot desert?}

### {217}{}{Well, yes, I have to practice my skills on someone. Be there.}
