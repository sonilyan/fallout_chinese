### {210}{}{Request for new prisoners.}
{210}{}{请求新囚犯。}
### {211}{}{The report of the mine administration: "Due to a shortage of workers, deadlines have been disrupted again. The mine destroys prisoners too quickly. We'll have to look for new blood in the surrounding settlements. There are rumors about wild tribes in the west. It's worth checking out."}
{211}{}{矿管局的报告称：“由于工人短缺，截止日期再次被打乱。矿井摧毁囚犯的速度太快了。我们将不得不在周围的定居点寻找新的血液。有传言说西部有野生部落。值得一看。”}
### {212}{}{Report on the expedition to the west.}
{212}{}{关于西部探险的报告。}
### {213}{}{The mercenaries returned with new blood. The peasants of the Villa turned out to be surprisingly excellent material - strong, healthy, hardy. Savages are worse, but they will also give odds to prisoners from the south. In addition to the peasants, there were provisions and other useful things in the Villa. On the way we found the town of Garage City; the locals offered a business, we need to think about it.}
{213}{}{雇佣兵带着新血回来了。事实证明，别墅里的农民是惊人的优秀物质――强壮、健康、顽强。野蛮人更糟糕，但他们也会给来自南方的囚犯带来麻烦。别墅里除了农民，还有粮食和其他有用的东西。在路上，我们找到了车库城；当地人提供了一笔生意，我们需要考虑一下。}
### {214}{}{The incident in the mine.}
{214}{}{矿井事故。}
### {215}{}{A group of convicts disappeared in the mine again, they turned out to be the same peasants from the Villa. Either I underestimated these hillbillies, or our defense system is not reliable enough. We will have to carry out punitive prevention among prisoners.}
{215}{}{一群罪犯又在矿井里失踪了，原来他们还是别墅里的农民。要么是我低估了这些乡巴佬，要么是我们的防御系统不够可靠。我们将不得不对囚犯进行惩罚性预防。}
### {216}{}{Sending prisoners to Phoenix.}
{216}{}{把囚犯送到凤凰城。}
### {217}{}{As expected, the fire worshippers immediately bought out the strongest peasants of the Villa and some savages. Compared to the rest of the prisoners, it was the highest quality product. In exchange, we received new weapons and ammunition, which were so lacking. Great deal.}
{217}{}{不出所料，拜火者立即买下了别墅里最强壮的农民和一些野蛮人。与其他囚犯相比，它是最高质量的产品。作为交换，我们得到了新的武器和弹药，而这些武器和弹药是如此缺乏。太好了。}
### {218}{}{Reduction of meat supplies.}
{218}{}{减少肉类供应。}
### {219}{}{Due to problems in San Brahmin, the supply of meat has decreased. We'll have to start hunting for mole rats and get a trapper camp in the mountains. Damn it, more unexpected expenses! On the other hand, this is another incentive for the development of the city.}
{219}{}{由于圣婆罗门的问题，肉类供应减少。我们必须开始寻找鼹鼠，并在山上建立一个狩猎营地。该死，更多的意外开支！另一方面，这也是城市发展的另一个动力。}
### {220}{}{Completion of excavations in Navajo.}
{220}{}{完成纳瓦霍的挖掘工作。}
### {221}{}{The Navajo military camp turned out to be almost useless. Almost all local resources were destroyed by explosions in warehouses. Only the burnt pillars of the old buildings remained. It is unprofitable to extract the remaining resources due to labor losses. The camp will have to be closed. But such a jackpot was planned...}
{221}{}{事实证明，纳瓦霍军营几乎毫无用处。几乎所有的当地资源都被仓库的爆炸摧毁了。只剩下被烧毁的老建筑的柱子。由于劳动力损失，开采剩余资源是无利可图的。营地将不得不关闭。但这样的头奖是有计划的...}
### {222}{}{Personal note.}
