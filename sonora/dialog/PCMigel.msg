#First meeting
### {200}{}{Hey, who let you in? It's closed... }
{200}{}{嘿，谁让你进来的？它关闭了。。。}
### {201}{}{?! I'll be damned, }
{201}{}{？！我会被诅咒的，}
### {202}{}{, what the...}
{202}{}{，什么。。。}
### {203}{}{Uncle Miguel, is that you? Long time no see!}
{203}{}{米格尔叔叔，是你吗？好久不见了！}
### {204}{}{Oh, how you've grown! I didn't recognize you right away. Although the facial features still resemble your padre... But, look, this is so unexpected. What are you doing here?}
{204}{}{哦，你怎么长大了！我没有马上认出你。虽然面部特征仍然像你的牧师。。。但是，看，这太出乎意料了。你在这里干什么？}
### {1204}{}{Oh, how you've grown! I didn't recognize you right away. Although the facial features still resemble your padre... But, look, this is so unexpected. What are you doing here?}
{1204}{}{哦，你怎么长大了！我没有马上认出你。虽然面部特征仍然像你的牧师。。。但是，看，这太出乎意料了。你在这里干什么？}
### {205}{}{I'm looking for my padre. It's a long story. In short, he and the other residents of the Villa were taken away by slavers.}
{205}{}{我在找我的牧师。说来话长。简而言之，他和别墅的其他居民都被奴隶贩子带走了。}
### {206}{}{That's how... I am so sorry. But I don't know anything about it. In any case, it's best if you leave this city as soon as possible.}
{206}{}{这就是为什么。。。我很抱歉。但我对此一无所知。无论如何，你最好尽快离开这个城市。}
### {207}{}{Why are you sending me away? Uncle Miguel, I've come so many miles to find you!}
{207}{}{你为什么要把我打发走？米格尔叔叔，我千里迢迢来找你！}
### {1207}{}{Why are you sending me away? Uncle Miguel, I've come so many miles to find you!}
{1207}{}{你为什么要把我打发走？米格尔叔叔，我千里迢迢来找你！}
### {208}{}{Do you even understand what's going on around you? Phoenix is not a Villa for you, there are completely different mores here. I don't want to put you in danger. If the boss finds out, it will be bad for both of us.}
{208}{}{你知道你周围发生了什么吗？凤凰城对你来说不是别墅，这里有完全不同的习俗。我不想把你置于危险之中。如果老板发现了，对我们俩都不利。}
### {209}{}{Don't worry about it. Don Diego is no more. He had an "accident".}
{209}{}{别担心，圣地亚哥已经不在了。他出了“意外”。}
### {210}{}{Is this your doing? Idiot! Diego was my only means of survival in this city. What am I going to do now?}
{210}{}{这是你干的吗？蠢人迭戈是我在这个城市唯一的生存手段。我现在该怎么办？}
### {1210}{}{Is this your doing? You fool! Diego was my only means of survival in this city. What am I going to do now?}
{1210}{}{这是你干的吗？你这个傻瓜！迭戈是我在这个城市唯一的生存手段。我现在该怎么办？}
### {211}{}{It seemed to me that you were almost in his thrall.}
{211}{}{在我看来，你几乎被他的奴役了。}
### {212}{}{You shouldn't have come here. Everything is too fragile. Diego was a criminal type, it's true. But he was developing the city. And now what? The fire worshippers will surely take control of the casino. Do you know what that means? I can see by my eyes that there isn't.}
{212}{}{你不应该来这里。一切都太脆弱了。迭戈是个罪犯，这是真的。但他正在开发这座城市。现在呢？拜火者肯定会控制赌场的。你知道这意味着什么吗？我可以用眼睛看到没有。}
### {213}{}{So will you help me find the padre?}
{213}{}{你能帮我找到牧师吗？}
### {214}{}{Look, I'm well settled in this city and I don't want any problems. Look for help elsewhere. For example... The Followers of Fire. They're the ones who pay mercenaries all over Arizona for their missionary projects.}
{214}{}{听着，我在这个城市住得很好，我不想有任何问题。在其他地方寻求帮助。例如火的追随者。他们付钱给亚利桑那州各地的雇佣兵做传教项目。}
### {215}{}{Okay. Goodbye, Uncle Miguel.}
{215}{}{可以再见，米格尔叔叔。}
### {216}{}{Don't worry about it. I'm leaving Phoenix soon, my business is already over.}
{216}{}{别担心，我马上就要离开凤凰城了，我的生意已经结束了。}
### {217}{}{Do you think so? I'm afraid things have only just begun at the Villa. This story of enslavement will not pass without a trace. I wonder how you and your padre will cope next.}
{217}{}{你这么认为吗？恐怕维拉的事情才刚刚开始。这个奴役的故事不会毫无痕迹地过去。我想知道你和你的牧师下一步会如何应对。}
### {218}{}{We will try. Goodbye, Uncle Miguel.}
{218}{}{我们会尽力的。再见，米格尔叔叔。}
### {219}{}{Don't worry about it. Don Diego and I have a great relationship.}
{219}{}{别担心，唐和我的关系很好。}
### {220}{}{I'm surprised. And you are much quicker and smarter than your padre. He didn't want to hear about the new opportunities that the rest of the world could give Villa. And now you're here and already making friends with one of the best people in the city. Well done.}
{220}{}{我很惊讶。而且你比你的牧师更快、更聪明。他不想听到世界其他地方给维拉的新机会。现在你在这里，已经和这个城市最好的人之一交上了朋友。干得好。}
### {221}{}{So will you help me find the padre?}
{221}{}{你能帮我找到牧师吗？}
### {222}{}{It's time for me to get back to the Villa. Goodbye, Uncle Miguel.}
{222}{}{我该回别墅了。再见，米格尔叔叔。}
### {223}{}{Are you enslaved to Don Diego?}
{223}{}{你是唐・迭戈的奴隶吗？}
### {224}{}{Slavery? No... No, I don't think so. But if he wants to, he will sell anyone into slavery. He's an important person here, runs the entire business center.}
{224}{}{奴隶身份不…不，我不这么认为。但如果他愿意，他会把任何人都卖为奴隶。他是这里的重要人物，管理着整个商业中心。}
### {225}{}{Even more so. Maybe he can help in the search for the padre?}
{225}{}{更是如此。也许他可以帮助寻找牧师？}
### {226}{}{So you're doing great. And I have to go to the Villa, my business here is already over.}
{226}{}{所以你做得很好。我必须去别墅，我在这里的生意已经结束了。}

### {230}{}{Hey, who let you in? It's closed... }
{230}{}{嘿，谁让你进来的？它关闭了。。。}
### {1230}{}{Hey, who let you in? It's closed... }
{1230}{}{嘿，谁让你进来的？它关闭了。。。}
### {231}{}{?! Damn me, it's my favorite nephew! It's good to see you, especially after all these events.}
{231}{}{？！该死的，这是我最喜欢的侄子！很高兴见到你，尤其是在经历了这么多之后。}
### {1231}{}{?! Damn me, it's my favorite nephew! Glad to see you, especially after all these events.}
{1231}{}{？！该死的，这是我最喜欢的侄子！很高兴见到你，尤其是在经历了这么多之后。}
### {232}{}{It's been a long time, Uncle Miguel.}
{232}{}{已经很久了，米格尔叔叔。}
### {233}{}{And you're growing up. I remember you at table level. A lot has changed since then.}
{233}{}{你在成长。我记得你在餐桌上。从那以后发生了很多变化。}
### {234}{}{Oh yes. And I have something to tell you. About the Villa, about the padre, about the robbers...}
{234}{}{哦，是的。我有话要告诉你。关于别墅，关于牧师，关于强盗。。。}
### {235}{}{Wait, to be honest, I knew about you and your mission. I even wanted to come out of the shadows and help you while you were in Phoenix. But something was missing for me. It seemed to me that the Villa had become the past for me, and now I regret that I was so careless.}
{235}{}{等等，说实话，我知道你和你的任务。当你在凤凰城的时候，我甚至想走出阴影，帮助你。但我缺少了一些东西。在我看来，别墅已经成为我的过去，现在我后悔我这么粗心。}
### {236}{}{Yes, the Villa is not the same as before.}
{236}{}{是的，别墅和以前不一样了。}
### {237}{}{I'm glad. And I am amazed at how you managed to save the Villa in such difficult conditions. You know, it seemed to me that these mouldy old men would sooner or later lead the Villa to extinction. And they almost succeeded if it wasn't for you. I don't know how much more they will last.}
{237}{}{我很高兴。我很惊讶你是如何在如此困难的条件下拯救维拉的。你知道，在我看来，这些发霉的老人迟早会导致别墅灭绝。如果不是因为你，他们几乎成功了。我不知道他们还能坚持多久。}
### {238}{}{I'm glad. But it seems that you didn't manage to convince these mouldy old people of the need for change, right? Yes, I can see it in your eyes. Villa needs people like you and me.}
{238}{}{我很高兴。但你似乎没能说服这些发霉的老人改变的必要性，对吧？是的，我能从你的眼睛里看到。维拉需要像你我这样的人。}
### {239}{}{Does it feel like you don't believe in the future of the Villa?}
{239}{}{你是不是觉得自己不相信维拉的未来？}
### {240}{}{That's why I left my homeland. He became a man without a home, severed all ties with the past. While you're busy with the eternal mouse fuss, you don't think about it. You need to get out of your box and see the world around you to understand this. And you succeeded. You're doing great.}
{240}{}{这就是我离开祖国的原因。他成了一个没有家的人，断绝了与过去的一切联系。当你忙于老鼠的永恒烦恼时，你不会去想它。你需要走出你的盒子，看看你周围的世界，才能理解这一点。你成功了。你做得很好。}
### {241}{}{Thank you, Uncle Miguel.}
{241}{}{谢谢你，米格尔叔叔。}
### {242}{}{No problem. But it's time for you to save the world. I don't want anyone in the casino to find out about our past.}
{242}{}{没问题。但现在是你拯救世界的时候了。我不想让赌场里的任何人知道我们的过去。}
### {243}{}{Goodbye.}
{243}{}{再见}
### {244}{}{It sounds blasphemous coming from you. After all, you left your family when you could help.}
{244}{}{你说这话听起来亵渎神明。毕竟，你在力所能及的时候就离开了家人。}
### {245}{}{Your truth. And I won't change your mind. But it seems it's time for you to save the world. I don't want anyone in the casino to find out about our past.}
{245}{}{你的真相。我不会改变你的主意。但现在似乎是你拯救世界的时候了。我不想让赌场里的任何人知道我们的过去。}
### {246}{}{Goodbye.}
{246}{}{再见}

#Repeat dialog
### {300}{}{Don't even come near me while we're at the casino.}
{300}{}{我们在赌场的时候都不要靠近我。}
### {301}{}{Goodbye.}
{301}{}{再见}

### {310}{}{Do you know what happened at the Villa?}
{310}{}{你知道别墅里发生了什么吗？}
### {311}{}{The news reached me out of the corner of my ear.}
{311}{}{这个消息从我耳边传来。}
### {312}{}{Do you know where our people are being held?}
{312}{}{你知道我们的人被关押在哪里吗？}
### {313}{}{I don't know for sure. The Followers of the Fire in the Cathedral may have this information.}
{313}{}{我不确定。大教堂里的火的追随者可能有这些信息。}
### {314}{}{And what does the Followers have to do with it?}
{314}{}{追随者们和它有什么关系？}
### {315}{}{Slaves are used by mercenaries, and mercenaries perform the tasks of Followers. They are in some way customers or patrons of the slave trade, although not everyone understands this. A colony in Flagstaff, built with the money of the Cathedral, or tinsmiths who signed many contracts with Followers - slaves are needed everywhere now.}
{315}{}{奴隶被雇佣兵使用，雇佣兵执行追随者的任务。他们在某种程度上是奴隶贸易的客户或赞助人，尽管不是每个人都理解这一点。弗拉格斯塔夫的一个殖民地，用大教堂的钱建造，或者是与追随者签订了许多合同的锡匠――现在到处都需要奴隶。}
### {316}{}{Your relatives are being forced to work, and you're talking about it so calmly?}
{316}{}{你的亲戚被迫工作，而你却如此平静地谈论这件事？}
### {317}{}{It's my brother's fault. If he had listened to me, this tragedy would not have happened at all.}
{317}{}{这是我哥哥的错。如果他听我的话，这场悲剧根本不会发生。}
### {318}{}{Everything is clear with you, Uncle. Let's change the subject.}
{318}{}{你一切都很清楚，叔叔。让我们换个话题。}

### {320}{}{Tell me about your escape from the Villa?}
{320}{}{告诉我你逃离别墅的事吗？}
### {321}{}{ESCAPE? Is that what my brother calls it? I knew that he was ready for any meanness to be forgotten about me... Know, dear nephew, that I didn't want to leave, I was KICKED out of there. Although I'm even glad of it.}
{321}{}{逃跑？这就是我哥哥的名字吗？我知道他已经准备好忘记我的任何卑鄙行为了……知道，亲爱的侄子，我不想离开，我被踢出了那里。尽管我甚至为此感到高兴。}
### {1321}{}{ESCAPE? Is that what my brother calls it? I knew that he was ready for any meanness to be forgotten about me... Know, dear niece, that I didn't want to leave, I was KICKED out of there. Although I'm even glad of it.}
{1321}{}{逃跑？这就是我哥哥的名字吗？我知道他已经准备好忘记我的任何卑鄙行为了……知道，亲爱的侄女，我不想离开，我被踢出了那里。尽管我甚至为此感到高兴。}
### {322}{}{Why were you kicked out?}
{322}{}{你为什么被开除？}
### {323}{}{After the death of our padre, your grandfather, Andres, as an older brother, began to manage the Villa. He followed the traditions, but I tried to come up with new ideas. Even then I understood that the Villa had to change.}
{323}{}{在我们的牧师去世后，你的祖父安德烈斯作为一个哥哥开始管理别墅。他遵循传统，但我试图提出新的想法。即使在那时，我也明白维拉必须改变。}
### {324}{}{Why?}
{324}{}{为什么？}
### {325}{}{Even then, we were faced with scoundrels from the wasteland, rangers and caravans from the neighboring town. We knew there was life outside the valley, too. But Andres carefully hid it from the rest of the residents. Just like the other elders did before him.}
{325}{}{即使在那时，我们也面临着来自荒地的恶棍、来自邻近城镇的护林员和大篷车。我们知道山谷外也有生命。但安德烈小心翼翼地把它藏起来，不让其他居民看见。就像他之前的其他长辈一样。}
### {326}{}{And you argued about it?}
{326}{}{你为此争论过吗？}
### {327}{}{We did not agree on the fate of the Villa. I offered to establish contacts with neighboring cities, use old equipment for cultivating the land, but he wouldn't let me open my mouth. He said it wasn't the time, that Diablo had possessed me... In the end, I said I would tell people the truth, but he just kicked me out of the settlement.}
{327}{}{我们对维拉的命运没有达成一致。我提出要和邻近的城市建立联系，用旧设备耕种土地，但他不让我开口。他说现在不是暗黑破坏神附身我的时候……最后，我说我会告诉人们真相，但他只是把我踢出了定居点。}
### {328}{}{What happened then?}
{328}{}{当时发生了什么？}
### {329}{}{I got to the next town. At that time, there was an active mine there, and I managed to make good money there. And at the same time I got acquainted with old technologies. Then the mine was crushed, and I went straight to Phoenix.}
{329}{}{我到了下一个城镇。当时，那里有一个活跃的矿场，我设法在那里赚了不少钱。与此同时，我熟悉了旧技术。然后地雷被砸碎了，我直接去了凤凰城。}
### {330}{}{Go on.}
{330}{}{继续}
### {331}{}{Here I saw all the charm of civilization in its full grandeur! But even here, residents do not understand or appreciate old things well. I was lucky that Don Diego hired me. He needed experts in old technology to set up a casino. I've been here ever since.}
{331}{}{在这里，我看到了文明的全部魅力，它的宏伟！但即使在这里，居民们也不能很好地理解或欣赏旧物。我很幸运，唐・迭戈雇了我。他需要老技术专家来建立赌场。从那以后我一直在这里。}
### {332}{}{So that's what you do here - drink and immerse yourself in women's pleasures?}
{332}{}{所以这就是你在这里所做的――喝酒，沉浸在女人的快乐中？}
### {333}{}{Take your time, dear nephew. I've worked hard enough to live beautifully. Besides, my machine is always ready to work.}
{333}{}{慢慢来，亲爱的侄子。我努力工作过得很漂亮。此外，我的机器随时可以工作。}
### {1333}{}{Take your time, dear niece. I've worked hard enough to live beautifully. Besides, my machine is always ready to work.}
{1333}{}{慢慢来，亲爱的侄女。我努力工作过得很漂亮。此外，我的机器随时可以工作。}
### {334}{}{What kind of machine?}
{334}{}{什么类型的机器？}
### {335}{}{Are you talking about the machine in your pants?}
{335}{}{你在说你裤子里的机器吗？}
### {336}{}{How to say it... I'm doing some technical work for Don Diego.}
{336}{}{怎么说呢…我正在为唐・迭戈做一些技术工作。}
### {337}{}{For example?}
{337}{}{例如}
### {338}{}{Sorry, but the boss won't like me talking about it.}
{338}{}{对不起，老板不喜欢我谈论这件事。}
### {339}{}{Okay, let's change the subject.}
{339}{}{好吧，让我们换个话题。}
### {340}{}{Will this story ever end?}
{340}{}{这个故事会结束吗？}
### {341}{}{"Old technology" is not just slot machines, right?}
{341}{}{“老技术”不仅仅是老虎机，对吧？}
### {342}{}{Heh-heh, and you're smart, plemyash. I'll tell you this - Diego wants to be aware of everything that brings power, strength and power. I was an extremely important find for him.}
{342}{}{呵呵，你很聪明，亲爱的。我要告诉你的是，迭戈希望意识到一切能带来力量、力量和力量的东西。我对他来说是一个极其重要的发现。}
