{100}{}{You see: Dr. Karl.}
{101}{}{He's got a small collection of drugs and medical items. Some seems veterinarian.}
#
{102}{}{Good day. What can Dr. Karl do for you?}
#dude healthy
{103}{}{What do you do here?}
{104}{}{Got any medicine I could buy?}
#dude hurt
{105}{}{I'm hurt.}
#
{106}{}{Well, as a doctor I take care of the community's health. I also sell medical supplies.}
{107}{}{It must be a hard job.}
{108}{}{On the contrary, I really love my work. Helping people gives me a sense of doing something worthwhile with
 my life. And I see the results every day.}
{109}{}{You're one in a million, Doc.}
#
{110}{}{If you ever need any of my services, come again.}
{111}{}{Thanks, Doc, I will.}
#
{112}{}{Hello again! What can Doc Karl do for you?}
{113}{}{I need some stimpaks.}
{114}{}{Nothing today, thanks.}
#
{115}{}{Nice to see you again. Are you interested to help me with something?}
{116}{}{Sure, Doc. What do you need?}
{117}{}{Can I buy some stims first?}
{118}{}{I got to go.}
#
{119}{}{You see this is an isolated town... People around here can hardly get their hands on the most basic supplies,
 and our reserves are tight. We help each other to balance the shortage as best we can, but lately I've run out of some
 medicine that is really needed here. I'm talking about heart pills... For several of my patients. Once, a traveler stopped
 by and he told me I could find some of those in a town east of here. Could you check it for me? I need two packages.
 I would be ever so grateful.}
{120}{}{Yes, I could try and look for them.}
{121}{}{Sorry, Doc, this is not your lucky day.}
#
{122}{}{Have you found some of those heart pills?}
{123}{}{Yep, I got two boxes, here you go.}
{124}{}{Nope. Didn't find any.}
#
{125}{}{Oh, thank God, you found them! These are really going to help. Thank you very much. If you need anything
 come and see me, I'll be glad to help you if I can.}
{126}{}{Thank you. Take care, Doc.}
#
{127}{}{Oh, God! please don't hurt me.}
{128}{}{I want to live.}
{129}{}{Don't hurt my patients, please.}
{130}{}{Take what you want, just don't hurt me.}
#
{131}{}{You have failed to use your steal skill.}
{132}{}{[Chance: }
{133}{}{You delivered the pills Dr. Karl needed. You gain 400 exp. points.}
#
{134}{}{Could you give me directions to that town?}
{135}{}{I'm afraid not, the traveler wasn't in the best of states. East is all I know. However, before you travel too far,
 you may visit Jack, near the gas station, he may have some pills left, but I doubt it.}
