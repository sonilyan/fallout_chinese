{100}{}{Leave me alone, alright. If you're here to ask more questions, you can forget about it. I already told the
 sheriff everything I know.}
#
{101}{}{I thought, if you weren't too busy spending your time in a locked cell, maybe we could talk for a minute?}
{102}{}{Sure, you can go back to whatever you were doing. I don't care.}
#
{103}{}{[Sits down on the bed.] I don't like the sound of it but you got a point. [Sighs.] You know, some bastard
 must've set me up. Problem is, I was so drunk that night I don't remember anyone putting some shit in my pocket. All I
 know is that I had an argument with some drunkard at the bar... Next thing I know, I was lying on the floor covered in
 glass and blood. Son of a bitch hit me on the head with a bottle...}
#
{104}{}{Doesn't sound familiar but I see where this is going. I'm here to get you out, are you all right now?}
{105}{}{Oh, now I see how you got that fancy haircut.}
#
{106}{}{Sure, maybe little numb but I can handle it. So, let's get back to that "get out" part. Why are you risking your
 ass for me anyway? I can't really pay you, I'm left with only a couple of bottle caps in my pockets. [Smiles.] That sure
 isn't going to cover my "release".}
#
{107}{}{A couple of bottle caps!? I'm out of here.}
{108}{}{Actually, your boss sent me to get you out. That's all I'm here for.}
#
{109}{}{Alright, man! You better have some plan because there's hardly room for one in here and it stinks!}
#
{110}{}{Sit tight, you'll be out in no time.}
#
{111}{}{I'm still in here! Get me out!}
#
{112}{}{Thanks man. See you at Basil's...}
#
{113}{}{Alright.}
#
{114}{}{Thanks again for that favor.}
{115}{}{You're always welcome here.}
{116}{}{Thanks man, I owe you big time!}
#
{117}{}{Bye.}
#
{118}{}{Wow, no way...}
#
{119}{}{Get used to it. This is where you belong.}
#
{120}{}{...as if that wasn't enough, the sheriff started asking me some questions. Shit, all I could hear was mumbling.
 You should have seen his face when he found a bag of contraband in my back pocket... he was waiting for something
 like that to happen. You know the rest of the story...}
{121}{}{There's also a part when you get out, I'm writing it right now... So, can you walk?}
{122}{}{Yeah... and his corpse rotted away in jail, happily ever after.}
#bad dude
{123}{}{Just fuck off!}
{124}{}{Wrong person!}
