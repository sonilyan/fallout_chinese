{100}{}{Hey stranger, you ain't from around here, right?}
{101}{}{Nope, I'm new in town. Say, do you live here?}
{102}{}{Sure I am, you can ask anyone.}
{103}{}{It's none of your business.}
#new here...
{104}{}{I came from up north. And after some misfortune, I had nowhere else to go... So I found this old tent, cleaned
 it up a bit and stayed here. It's better than nothing but I can barely get anything to eat. It's hard for me to ask but could
 you borrow me some money? I really need it...}
{105}{}{Sure, how much do you need?}
{106}{}{Sorry I don't have any right now.}
#how much...
{107}{}{I don't know... Maybe $25, I just want to buy something to eat. Man, I haven't eaten for days.}
{108}{}{[You reach into your pockets to give him the money.] OK, here you go.}
{109}{}{[You toss a few caps on the ground.] That's all I have...}
#here you go...
{110}{}{Oh, thanks! [Before you can react, he suddenly pulls out a hypodermic needle and sticks it in your hand.] Don't worry, you're not going to feel a thing. Just relax, struggling won't help you...}
{111}{}{[Just a second later you realize something's wrong but your vision is fading quickly.] ...what... the...?}
#I don't have that much... line 125
{112}{}{That's OK, I'll manage. [You turn around but suddenly the alleged invalid shows a surprising quickness, pulls
 out a hypodermic needle and sticks it in the back of your neck.] Don't worry, you're not going to feel a thing. Just relax,
 struggling won't do you any good...}
{113}{}{[Just a second later you realize something's wrong but you have already lost your balance and fell down.]
 ...what... the...}
#sure I am from around...
{114}{}{Then you probably wonder why I am here. The truth is, I have nowhere else to go... It has been some time
 since I came here from up north. Well, this is better than some places I used to live in. It's only... [sighs]. I barely have
 anything to eat. Could you help...? Lend me a few caps maybe?}
{115}{}{Sure, how much do you need?}
{116}{}{Sorry I don't have any right now.}
#float messages...
{117}{}{[Laughing.] Haha... I knew you'd take the bait.}
{118}{}{You just can't stop being what you are, a well trained puppet!}
{119}{}{...sweet dreams...}
{120}{}{...Oh, youuu...hmmmm...}
{121}{}{...zzzzzz...}
{122}{}{OK, let's go...}
{123}{}{Wait, I have an idea, let's make sure and drag the bastard to the base!}
{124}{}{Yeah! Least we can do after all the mapping the puppet has done for us. ::grins::}
#
{125}{}{I don't have that much right now, I'll come back later.}
#added in 1.04...
{126}{}{Hey, you're alive. [Smiles.] Heh, sorry about that... I had my orders.}
{127}{}{Sure, tell me where can I find Scott.}
{128}{}{Right, see you later.}
#find Scott
{129}{}{I haven't contacted him but he should be at his headquarters down in the base.}
{130}{}{OK, thanks.}
#
{131}{}{Hey! How's it going? Everything all right?}
{132}{}{Hey, nice to see you again. It's hard for me to ask but could I borrow some money? I really need it...}
{133}{}{Hello again stranger, you ain't from around here, right?}
#added in 2021, new path to find the shelter
{134}{}{What's the matter? Can I help you?}
{135}{}{Have any strangers used this tent recently?}
{136}{}{How long have you been here?}
{137}{}{Tell me about yourself.}
{138}{}{I need to be going.}
#strangers?
{139}{}{Not that I recall, and I'm here most of the time [points at his legs] they don't carry me as they used to.}
{140}{}{What happened?}
#...been here?
{141}{}{Not long. I took this tent after the doctors released me, maybe a few months back? Heck, can't remember.
 Recovery 's been slow and dull.}
#about yourself
{142}{}{I'm Gilbert. Used to ride the caravans; trading, guarding, taking care of the animals, whatever needed
 doing, well, until the incident.}
#What happened?
{143}{}{The caravan got ambushed, like most caravans these days, it seems. We tried to fight, but it didn't work, so we
 gave up the wagons and tried to get out alive. Didn't work either, most got shot, caught a bullet myself, smashed right
 through my calf [he points at it], stumbled and fell in a ravine, broke a few bones, and was left for dead. Few days later
 another caravan found me and brought me here. I recovered, but may never walk properly ever again.}
{144}{}{I see, all the best.}
#
{145}{}{Wait! Maybe you can do something for me? I'm outta work and not much use anymore, but I traveled a fair bit
 and some gent asked me to draw a map of the area. Which is all fine and dandy, problem is I can't get around much
 anymore. So, you being on the road a lot, maybe if you could fill in some blanks for me, it would really help.}
{146}{}{What do you need?}
#
{147}{}{Well, maybe you could visit some places for me, as in actually going there, have a look around, and then tell
 me about it, stuff like that. I can't give you directions or anything, some places I've only ever heard of talked about, but
 if you could find those and fill in the gaps, I may do a better map for it.}
{148}{}{What places do you need to know about?}
#
{149}{}{Let's see... an update on places like Miners Town, Farmers Town, Philton, Golden Valley and Duntown would
 be nice, then there's a Military Base I heard rumors about, a Medical Research Center nearby Canville, and last a place
 called Silting. No idea what or where that one is. That's it, I guess. If you could find routes to those and collect some
 information about them like terrain and the settlement itself, I could finish my map and maybe make a few bucks
 more.}
{150}{}{OK, I'm on it.}
#
{151}{}{Great, know what, while you're looking for places, I'll try and have a word with the locals, maybe I can find
 out something about the people you're looking for. How does that sound?}
{152}{}{Sounds like a deal.}
#
{153}{}{You're back. Anything else you want?}
#
{154}{}{I think I found all the information you need.}
#
{155}{}{That's great, thanks a lot, this will really help me make a few bucks, ehm, I hate to ask, but maybe could you
 give me some coins? I'm still struggling a bit, with my crippled leg, and cash flow being as it is... a $100, maybe?}
#
{156}{}{Let's talk about something else.}
{157}{}{What do you want to know?}
