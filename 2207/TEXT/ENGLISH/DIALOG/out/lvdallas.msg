{111}{012}{你知道是谁拿走的吗？}

### {120}{}{[Dallas thinks for a second] Let's see... My parents didn't take it for sure - they just don't need it. Fox also has no interest in a science book. She likes to read only some old magazines, mainly because of pictures. So - it's not McKinseys. Try to ask other families - Hortons or Duntons. }
{120}{}{[达拉斯思考了一下]让我们看看。。。我的父母并不确定――他们只是不需要它。福克斯也对科学书不感兴趣。她只喜欢看一些旧杂志，主要是因为照片。所以，这不是麦金西斯。试着问问其他家庭――霍顿或邓顿。}

{121}{023}{告诉我你的家庭情况。}
### {122}{019}{What can you tell me about other families?}

{123}{999}{我明白了。我去别的地方看看。}

{130}{}{[达拉斯悠闲地开始说话]这个金库大约建于200年前。这里住着四个家庭――施温家、霍顿家、邓顿家和我们麦金西斯家。我们都是名人的后裔。}

{135}{010}{我会问一些其他的事情。}

{140}{}{[达拉斯微笑]利沃斯的居民是这个地方的悲哀和喜悦。一方面，有许多不同的人物和世界观。另一方面，从狂热分子到精神分裂症患者，他们的范围各不相同。}
### {141}{018}{Who in Livos is the fanatic and who is schizophrenic?}
{141}{018}{利沃斯的狂热分子是谁，精神分裂症患者是谁？}
### {142}{019}{Tell me more about inhabitants.}
{142}{019}{告诉我更多关于居民的信息。}
### {143}{016}{Oh yeah, since I have become the inhabitant of Livos, there's plus one more fanatic and schizophrenic!}
{143}{016}{哦，是的，自从我成为利沃斯的居民后，又多了一个狂热分子和精神分裂症患者！}
### {144}{015}{What the dwellers are busy with?}
{144}{015}{居民们在忙什么？}
### {145}{010}{I'd like to ask about something else.}
{145}{010}{我想问一些其他的事情。}

{146}{999}{我刚刚想起我需要做点什么。我们稍后再谈。}

{156}{999}{我现在没有时间聊天。我最好去。}

### {160}{}{[Dallas didn't even flinch] I never doubted it. Only a psycho would run around Radius, which is full of danger, bandits, and radiation. No offense.}
{160}{}{[达拉斯甚至没有退缩]我从来没有怀疑过。只有一个神经病才会在充满危险、土匪和辐射的Radius周围奔跑。无意冒犯。}
### {161}{017}{What if this psycho would want to cave your head in?}
{161}{017}{如果这个神经病想把你的脑袋埋进去怎么办？}
### {162}{010}{Maybe. Let me ask something else.}
{162}{010}{大概让我再问一个问题。}
### {163}{999}{Yes, I'm a psycho. I'd better go, I think I'm being followed.}
{163}{999}{是的，我是个神经病。我最好走了，我想我被人跟踪了。}

### {170}{}{[Dallas makes a gesture with the palm of his hand] No need for aggression. Let's continue the conversation peacefully, without fights.}
{170}{}{[达拉斯用手掌做了个手势]没有必要咄咄逼人。让我们和平地继续对话，不要争吵。}
### {171}{998}{It's too late for that! I'm gonna bash your brains out!}
{171}{998}{太迟了！我要狠狠地揍你一顿！}
### {172}{010}{Okay, I'm calm. I have other questions.}
{172}{010}{好吧，我很冷静。我还有其他问题。}

{183}{999}{我去找他们。再见}

### {1901}{}{I don't think it would be right to talk details about this with... Non-locals. No offense.}
{1901}{}{我认为与…谈论这件事的细节是不对的。。。非本地人。无意冒犯。}
### {1902}{}{Livos is inhabited by four families - Schweins, Hortons, Duntons, and us, McKinseys. Who do you want to know about?}

{195}{010}{事实上，我想谈谈其他事情。}
### {196}{999}{I'm not very interested to hear about it right now. I'll go.}
{196}{999}{我现在对这件事不太感兴趣。我去。}

### {2001}{}{I'm not into rumors. If you want to talk about them, you'd better look for my sister Fox. She likes to blab. It pisses everyone around her, even me. Sometimes, she can stick to me and chirp without end. She is able to talk for hours and give zero useful information.}
{2001}{}{我不喜欢谣言。如果你想谈论他们，你最好去找我的妹妹福克斯。她喜欢胡言乱语。这让她周围的每一个人都很恼火，甚至我也不例外。有时，她会一直粘着我，叽叽喳喳。她能讲上几个小时，却没有提供任何有用的信息。}
### {201}{010}{Okay, I want to ask something else.}
{201}{010}{好吧，我想问别的问题。}
### {202}{999}{I'll go speak to her. Want to learn more about local rumors.}
{202}{999}{我去和她说话。想了解更多关于当地谣言的信息。}
### {2002}{}{I'm not into rumors. If you want to talk about them, you'd better look for my sister Fox. Actually, to be able to do that, you should become the inhabitant of Livos. Edward decides who is worthy to live among us.}
{2002}{}{我不喜欢谣言。如果你想谈论他们，你最好去找我的妹妹福克斯。事实上，要做到这一点，你应该成为利沃斯的居民。爱德华决定谁值得和我们一起生活。}
### {203}{999}{So, it's all that I need to do then... See you around.}
{203}{999}{所以，这就是我需要做的全部。。。回头见。}

### {210}{}{The Schweins are not doing anything helpful. Ludwig sits in his laboratory, trying to turn his fantasies into the reality of the material world. Christopher is an average and greedy vendor, you could see him by the entrance. I can't stand him. Also, need to mention an old man Edward, who thinks that he is the most important person in the vault. When in fact, he just watches the entrance. Even the child could handle this job. Other ones are not worth mentioning.}
{210}{}{施温一家没有做任何有益的事情。路德维希坐在他的实验室里，试图把他的幻想变成物质世界的现实。克里斯托弗是一个普通贪婪的小贩，你可以从门口看到他。我受不了他。此外，还需要提到一位老人爱德华，他认为自己是金库里最重要的人。事实上，他只是看着入口。即使是孩子也能胜任这份工作。其他的则不值一提。}
### {211}{022}{What can you tell me about Duntons?}
{211}{022}{关于邓顿，你能告诉我什么？}
### {212}{028}{I want to know about Hortons.}
{212}{028}{我想了解霍顿的情况。}
### {213}{023}{Can you tell me about your family?}
{213}{023}{你能告诉我你的家庭情况吗？}
### {214}{029}{Why you don't like Christopher?}
{214}{029}{你为什么不喜欢克里斯托弗？}
### {215}{010}{Actually, I'd like to talk about something else.}
{215}{010}{事实上，我想谈谈其他事情。}

### {220}{}{Of all the Dunton family, only Emily is worth mentioning. Bossy and arrogant bitch. Thinks she is better than everyone when in reality she just has overblown self-esteem. She doesn't even take her husband for a living being, not mentioning the others. Emily gives speeches at the meetings, but for the most time, she is worthless.}
{220}{}{在邓顿家族中，只有埃米莉值得一提。傲慢自大的婊子。认为她比所有人都好，而实际上她只是自尊心太强了。她甚至不以丈夫为生，更不用说其他人了。艾米莉在会议上发表演讲，但在大多数情况下，她毫无价值。}
### {221}{021}{What can you tell me about Schweins?}
{221}{021}{关于Schweins你能告诉我什么？}
### {222}{028}{I want to learn about Hortons.}
{222}{028}{我想了解霍顿。}
### {223}{023}{Tell me about your family, McKinseys.}
{223}{023}{告诉我你的家庭，麦金西斯。}
### {224}{010}{I learned what I needed. Let me ask something else.}
{224}{010}{我学到了我需要的东西。让我再问一个问题。}

### {230}{}{[Dallas smiles and proudly continues] It's no secret that our family is the most influential in Livos. We are responsible for the vitally important product - clean water. Nothing compares to this. The head of our family is Boston McKinsey, my father. I'm doing most of the work... Practically everything. Other members of our family you'd better meet personally.}
{230}{}{[达拉斯微笑着自豪地继续说道]我们家在利沃什是最有影响力的，这已经不是什么秘密了。我们负责至关重要的产品――清洁水。没有什么能与之相比。我们家的户主是波士顿麦肯锡，我的父亲。我在做大部分的工作。。。几乎所有的东西。我们家的其他成员你最好亲自去见。}
### {231}{024}{What exactly do you do here?}
{231}{024}{你到底在这里做什么？}
### {232}{028}{Tell me about Hortons.}
{232}{028}{告诉我关于霍顿的事。}
### {233}{021}{What about the Schweins?}
{233}{021}{那施温家呢？}
### {234}{022}{I'd like to know about Duntons.}
{234}{022}{我想了解邓顿的情况。}
### {235}{010}{Let's change the subject. I want to ask something else.}
{235}{010}{让我们换个话题。我想问别的问题。}

### {2401}{}{[Dallas gives you a little smile] Why, patron, can't remember who's doing what? I deal in exports of drinkable water into settlements of Radius. I make contracts and manage the deliveries. With all gallantry, I can say that my job is the most important for the survival of Livos. In exchange, we get the canned food and other goods.}
{2401}{}{[达拉斯给你一个小小的微笑]为什么，赞助人，不记得是谁在做什么了？我经营向Radius定居点出口饮用水的业务。我签订合同并管理交货。尽管如此，我可以说我的工作对利沃斯的生存来说是最重要的。作为交换，我们得到罐头食品和其他商品。}
### {2402}{}{[Dallas points into his papers] I deal in exports of drinkable water into settlements of Radius. I make contracts and manage the deliveries. With all gallantry, I can say that my job is the most important for the survival of Livos. In exchange, we get the canned food and other goods.}
{2402}{}{[达拉斯在他的文件中指出]我经营向Radius定居点出口饮用水的业务。我签订合同并管理交货。尽管如此，我可以说我的工作对利沃斯的生存来说是最重要的。作为交换，我们得到罐头食品和其他商品。}
### {241}{025}{I want to talk about water deliveries to the NWO.}
{241}{025}{我想谈谈向NWO供水的问题。}
### {242}{042}{Can you sell me clean water?}
{242}{042}{你能卖给我干净的水吗？}
### {243}{010}{One more question.}
{243}{010}{还有一个问题。}

### {250}{}{[Dallas raises his eyebrow] Yeah? What's wrong with them? }
{250}{}{[达拉斯扬起眉毛]是吗？他们怎么了？}
### {251}{026}{Water is not good. I want to find out why.}
{251}{026}{水不好。我想找出原因。}
### {252}{027}{The water tastes a little strange. I was asked to find out what's wrong. People are becoming nervous, if it continues - they won't buy as much as they used to. And that means your profits will drop significantly.}
{252}{027}{水的味道有点奇怪。我被要求找出问题所在。如果这种情况持续下去，人们会变得紧张――他们不会像过去那样买那么多了。这意味着你的利润会大幅下降。}

### {260}{}{I won't talk details about water deliveries. If there's taste, then it should be like this. Period.}
{260}{}{我不会谈论供水的细节。如果有味道的话，它应该是这样的。时期}
### {261}{010}{Hm... Alright, I'll ask something else.}
{261}{010}{嗯…好吧，我再问别的问题。}

### {270}{}{[Dallas scratches his chin] Well... We are definitely not interested in profit drops. Okay, I'll tell you about the taste. Due to the large quantities of exported water, we are concerned with the stability of our water filter. So we resorted to the backup option of water processing. We use carbon canisters, charcoal filters. Still, the filtration quality stays at the highest level. You can tell them that our water is good. Nothing to worry about.}
{270}{}{[达拉斯挠了挠下巴]嗯。。。我们对利润下降绝对不感兴趣。好的，我来告诉你味道。由于大量的出口水，我们关心我们的滤水器的稳定性。因此，我们采用了水处理的备用方案。我们使用碳罐，木炭过滤器。尽管如此，过滤质量仍保持在最高水平。你可以告诉他们我们的水很好。没什么好担心的。}
### {271}{999}{Great, I'll tell them everything is alright.}
{271}{999}{太好了，我会告诉他们一切都好。}

### {280}{}{Ashton Horton, the head of the family, makes repairings in the vault. He can't fix serious ones though, only something little. He and his sister, Claudia, are a little off. You'll see what I mean when you talk to them. [His voice suddenly becomes shaky, eyes looking away] And there's Mignon, daughter of Claudia and deceased Peter... A beautiful flower, blooming in the family of schizophrenic...}
{280}{}{阿什顿・霍顿（Ashton Horton）是这个家族的首领，他在金库里进行维修。不过，他不能解决严重的问题，只能解决一些小问题。他和他的妹妹克劳迪娅有点不对劲。当你和他们说话的时候，你就会明白我的意思了。[他的声音突然变得颤抖，目光移开]还有克劳迪娅和已故彼得的女儿米农。。。一朵美丽的花，绽放在精神分裂症患者的家庭。。。}
### {281}{030}{I see you have a thing about Mignon.}
{281}{030}{我看你对米农有点了解。}
### {282}{021}{Tell me about Schweins.}
{282}{021}{告诉我关于施温斯的事。}

{283}{022}{关于邓顿，你能说些什么？}
### {284}{023}{Can you tell me about your family?}
{284}{023}{你能告诉我你的家庭情况吗？}
### {285}{010}{I want to ask something else.}
{285}{010}{我想问别的问题。}

### {2901}{}{He was getting in the way of our relationship with Mignon, but now she will be my wife. All of this - thanks to you!}
{2901}{}{他妨碍了我们与Mignon的关系，但现在她将成为我的妻子。所有这些――感谢你！}
### {2902}{}{[He clenches his fists] Christopher is getting into our relationship with Mignon! Stupid, greedy haggler!}
{2902}{}{[他握紧拳头]克里斯托弗要和米农谈恋爱了！愚蠢贪婪的讨价还价者！}
### {2903}{}{This scumbag stole my Mignon! I hate him!}
{2903}{}{这个卑鄙的家伙偷走了我的Mignon！我恨他！}
### {291}{030}{You and Mignon - are you in a relationship?}
{291}{030}{你和Mignon――你在谈恋爱吗？}
### {292}{010}{I want to ask something else.}
{292}{010}{我想问别的问题。}

### {300}{}{Yes, I'm in love with Mignon, cute little blonde beauty... And I want to marry her. But there's this Christopher Schwein, always getting in our way! He wants to steal her from me! This insolent and rough man doesn't deserve to be a husband of such an extraordinary girl!}
{300}{}{是的，我爱上了Mignon，一个可爱的金发美女。。。我想娶她。但有一个克里斯托弗・施温，总是挡着我们的路！他想把她从我身边偷走！这个粗鲁无礼的男人不配做这样一个非凡女孩的丈夫！}
### {301}{031}{What does Mignon think? Who she wants to be with?}
{301}{031}{Mignon怎么想？她想和谁在一起？}
### {302}{032}{How are you going to get her love?}
{302}{032}{你将如何得到她的爱？}

### {310}{}{She doesn't know yet. She likes the competition we have over her. }
{310}{}{她还不知道。她喜欢我们对她的竞争。}
### {311}{032}{How exactly are you going to make your move?}
{311}{032}{你打算如何行动？}

### {320}{}{Mignon likes romantic things. We can talk for hours - about feelings, beauty, dreams, love. But she also likes straight-forward and brazen men. Christopher is exactly like this, despite not being able to put two words together. If only I could make a romantic evening for her... She would have definitely picked me over him. Or maybe I need her to start hating Christopher for something. That would work too.}
{320}{}{米农喜欢浪漫的东西。我们可以聊上几个小时――关于感情、美丽、梦想、爱情。但她也喜欢直来直去、厚颜无耻的男人。克里斯托弗就是这样，尽管他不能把两个词放在一起。如果我能为她安排一个浪漫的夜晚就好了。。。她肯定会选择我而不是他。或者我需要她开始因为某些事情而憎恨克里斯托弗。这也行得通。}
### {321}{033}{Why don't you organize such an evening?}
{321}{033}{你为什么不组织这样一个晚会？}

### {330}{}{The thing is, we don't have any music disks left in the vault. If I would have found one CD with romantic songs, her heart would definitely be mine.}
{330}{}{问题是，我们的保险库里已经没有音乐光盘了。如果我能找到一张浪漫歌曲的CD，她的心一定是我的。}
### {331}{034}{I could try to look for a CD for you. And what about Christopher?}
{331}{034}{我可以试着给你找一张CD。克里斯托弗呢？}

### {340}{}{Christopher attracts her with his straightforwardness and self-confidence. But in reality, this opportunistic scumbag is willing to sell his own mother for a couple of extra batteries. He tends to have a bit of a temper, so he can be provoked.}
{340}{}{克里斯托弗以他的直率和自信吸引着她。但事实上，这个投机取巧的卑鄙小人愿意为了多买几块电池而卖掉自己的母亲。他往往有点脾气，所以很容易被激怒。}
### {341}{035}{I'd like to help you with this matter.}
{341}{035}{我想帮你处理这件事。}
### {342}{010}{I don't want to get involved in your love games. Let's change the subject.}
{342}{010}{我不想卷入你的爱情游戏。让我们换个话题。}

### {350}{}{You would? That's great! Convince Mignon that Christopher Schwein is not right for her, that he is an aggressive and stale idiot. Or if you find any CD with romantic music, bring it to me!}
{350}{}{你会吗？太棒了！让Mignon相信Christopher Schwein不适合她，他是一个好斗、陈腐的白痴。或者，如果你找到任何带有浪漫音乐的CD，请把它带给我！}
### {351}{999}{Okay, I'll remember that. See you around.}
{351}{999}{好的，我会记住的。回头见。}

### {360}{}{What do you want to talk about?}

### {364}{040}{I talked to Christopher about you and Mignon.}
{364}{040}{我和克里斯托弗谈过你和米农的事。}
### {365}{010}{Nothing for now. I'd like to ask something else.}
{365}{010}{暂时没有。我想问些别的问题。}

### {370}{}{Get me some music CDs or talk Mignon into leaving Christopher. Maybe you can even get him into aggression. }
{370}{}{给我拿些音乐CD，或者说服米农离开克里斯托弗。也许你甚至可以让他变得咄咄逼人。}
### {371}{999}{I'll see what I can do.}
{371}{999}{我看看我能做些什么。}

### {380}{}{Great! That's just what I need! We are going to have a wonderful evening with my lovely Mignon, it will be unforgettable! Here, take this present from me.}
{380}{}{太棒了这正是我所需要的！我们将与我可爱的Mignon度过一个美好的夜晚，这将是难忘的！给，把这份礼物拿走。}
