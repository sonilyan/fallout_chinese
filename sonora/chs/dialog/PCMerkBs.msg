{242}{}{哦，不是。这是一个雇佣兵帮会，不是妓院。多年来，我一直在和火崇拜者一起工作，运送奴隶和罪犯穿越沙漠。突然间，你来阻止我一堆该死的合同。什么鬼东西？}
### {243}{}{I'm telling you, it's personal.}
{243}{}{我告诉你，这是针对个人的。}

{259}{}{（慢慢地把手放在机枪上，凝视着你的眼睛）滚出我的办公室。}

{265}{}{我想重获自由。修补匠们待我不好。}
### {266}{}{Hmm. Tinkerers will not want to buy a runaway slave again at the same price. You're putting me in an awkward position. Well, I'm ready to buy your rights and sign a free one. But it will cost 1000 caps. I doubt you have that amount.}
{266}{}{嗯。修补匠们不会再以同样的价格买一个逃跑的奴隶了。你让我处于尴尬的境地。好吧，我准备买下你的权利并签署一份免费的。但它将花费1000顶帽子。我怀疑你有那么多钱。}

{267}{}{我会找到的。}
### {268}{}{Then there's nothing left for me... I'll kill you.}

### {273}{}{Of course.}
{273}{}{当然}
### {274}{}{Don't even think about it.}
{274}{}{别想了。}
### {275}{}{The mainline workers made me a mediator in the negotiations.}
{275}{}{主要工人让我在谈判中充当调解人。}
### {276}{}{This is a surprise. And if that's true, you might be good. Well, while you're in this city, take care of yourself. After all, the locals are not in the spirit of the mainline workers.}
{276}{}{这是一个惊喜。如果这是真的，你可能很好。好吧，当你在这个城市的时候，照顾好你自己。毕竟，当地人并不符合主线工人的精神。}
### {277}{}{They have a lot of enemies, that's right.}
{277}{}{他们有很多敌人，没错。}
### {278}{}{You know too much, Bruce. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to keep you quiet...}
{278}{}{你知道的太多了，布鲁斯。对不起，我得让你安静。。。}

### {281}{}{A battle trophy.}
{281}{}{战斗奖杯。}
### {282}{}{Hmm. Okay, I can believe it. But it's better not to shine in it in this city. Many people here have heard about highway bandits and may take you for one of them.}

### {285}{}{A gift from a good man.}
{285}{}{一个好人送的礼物。}
### {286}{}{You have dangerous friends. I advise you to hide it away while you're in town. The locals have heard about highway bandits. You can accidentally grab a bullet in the forehead.}
{286}{}{你有危险的朋友。我建议你进城时把它藏起来。当地人听说过高速公路上的土匪。你可能不小心在前额中了一颗子弹。}

### {290}{}{Well, well, and here's another victim of the desert. They say you made a lot of noise in Casa Grande. Is it true?}
{290}{}{好吧，好吧，这是沙漠的另一个受害者。他们说你在格兰德之家制造了很多噪音。这是真的吗？}

{291}{}{你在说什么？我和当地人的关系很好。}
### {292}{}{Don't lie to me, buddy. My sources can't be so wrong.}

### {294}{}{Yes, I had to shut someone's mouth. The locals are too suspicious.}
{294}{}{是的，我不得不闭上别人的嘴。当地人太多疑了。}
### {295}{}{ (raises one eyebrow) Honest confession? This simplifies things.}

### {296}{}{What's the deal?}
{296}{}{怎么回事？}
### {297}{}{You're lucky the locals can't pay for your head. But keep in mind, this can change at any time.}
{297}{}{你很幸运，当地人付不起你的人头。但请记住，这种情况随时可能改变。}

### {327}{}{He's an old friend of mine. And it's not his fault. Let him go.}
{327}{}{他是我的一个老朋友。这不是他的错。放开他。}
### {328}{}{I don't know you, and your word means nothing in this city. And if you interfere with my work, you will end up in the same cage for complicity.}
{328}{}{我不认识你，你的话在这个城市毫无意义。如果你干涉我的工作，你最终会因为同谋而被关进同一个笼子。}
### {329}{}{OK.}
{329}{}{好啊}
### {330}{}{I know that you have detained the red Cardinal.}
{330}{}{我知道你拘留了红衣主教。}
### {331}{}{Yes, let him sit in prison and think about his future. But how do YOU know that? No one except the capture group was aware.}
{331}{}{是的，让他坐在监狱里思考他的未来。但是你怎么知道呢？除了捕获组之外，没有人知道。}
### {332}{}{I have operational sources. What is he accused of?}

### {343}{}{Can I just talk to him? I'll pay 10 caps for it.}
{343}{}{我能和他谈谈吗？我将为此支付10顶帽子。}

### {346}{}{The Cathedral of Fire is concerned about what happened. This guy was part of our intelligence. Let him go. Immediately.}

### {362}{}{Who, for example?}
{362}{}{例如，谁？}
### {363}{}{The main clients are the Flagstaff Colony and the tinsmiths. But I wouldn't call such a commodity slaves. Usually these are criminals serving their sentences. And what is your interest?}
{363}{}{主要客户是弗拉格斯塔夫殖民地和锡匠。但我不会称这种商品为奴隶。通常这些都是正在服刑的罪犯。你感兴趣的是什么？}
### {364}{}{Just curious.}
{364}{}{只是好奇。}
### {365}{}{Mere curiosity arouses suspicion. I hope you understand what that means.}
{365}{}{仅仅是好奇心就引起怀疑。我希望你明白这意味着什么。}

{366}{}{嗯，我想是的。}
### {367}{}{I'm thinking of buying a couple of slaves.}
{367}{}{我在考虑买几个奴隶。}

### {379}{}{It's not worth it, I'll try to figure it out on my own.}
{379}{}{这不值得，我会自己想办法。}
### {380}{}{Something has become clear. Several slaves originally from the Villa actually ended up in the Flagstaff colony. They were bought by fire worshippers and transported to their Cathedral. They must have been damn good slaves if they had to be driven over such distances. What became of them is known only to the monks. }
{380}{}{有些事情已经变得很清楚了。几名来自别墅的奴隶最终被关进了弗拉格斯塔夫殖民地。它们被火崇拜者买下并运到他们的大教堂。如果他们必须被赶过这么长的距离，他们一定是非常好的奴隶。他们的下场只有僧侣们知道。}
### {381}{}{Thank you, Bruce. It's time for me to visit this very Cathedral of Fire. Or whatever his name is.}
{381}{}{谢谢你，布鲁斯。是时候让我参观这座火之大教堂了。或者不管他叫什么名字。}
### {382}{}{Ugh. I would have found out without you.}
{382}{}{啊。如果没有你，我早就知道了。}
### {1382}{}{Ugh. I would have found out without you.}
{1382}{}{啊。如果没有你，我早就知道了。}
### {383}{}{Something has become clear. Several slaves originally from the Villa ended up in the Flagstaff colony. They were bought by fire worshippers and transported to penal servitude in Two-Sun. Apparently, they were damn good slaves if they had to be driven over such distances.}
{383}{}{有些事情已经变得很清楚了。几个最初来自别墅的奴隶最终被关进了弗拉格斯塔夫殖民地。它们被火崇拜者买下，并在二日被流放到劳役所。显然，如果他们必须被赶过这么长的距离，他们就是该死的好奴隶。}
### {384}{}{Thank you, Bruce. It's time for me to visit this dubious town. I hope caravans go there.}
{384}{}{谢谢你，布鲁斯。是时候让我参观这个可疑的小镇了。我希望大篷车能去那里。}
### {385}{}{You know, Bruce, your help wasn't very helpful. Goodbye.}
{385}{}{你知道，布鲁斯，你的帮助不是很有帮助。再见}
### {386}{}{I'll come back later. Now I don't have so many caps with me.}
{386}{}{我稍后再回来。现在我没有那么多帽子了。}

### {390}{}{We need to eliminate one rowdy. His name is George Crook.}
{390}{}{我们需要消除一个吵闹的人。他的名字叫乔治・克鲁克。}
### {391}{}{The same Commander Crook who subdued the Western tribe? Why do you want to remove it?}
{391}{}{就是那个克罗克指挥官制服了西方部落？为什么要删除它？}
### {392}{}{I'm just representing the customer.}
{392}{}{我只是代表客户。}
### {393}{}{Clearly. This old soldier has already managed to annoy many people in the city. Moreover, my best guys defected to his squad at one time. And now Crook just throws the bottlecaps to the wind, not knowing what to do with himself. I don't understand how the casino tolerates his drunken antics.}
{393}{}{清晰地这个老战士已经惹恼了城里的许多人。此外，我最好的人曾经叛逃到他的小队。现在克鲁克只是把瓶子扔到风里，不知道该怎么办。我不明白赌场怎么能容忍他醉酒后的滑稽行为。}
### {394}{}{So will you take on this task?}
{394}{}{那么你会承担这项任务吗？}
### {395}{}{Well, I didn't say that, but for 500 caps the world will forget about his existence.}
{395}{}{好吧，我没有这么说，但对于500场比赛，世界将忘记他的存在。}
### {396}{}{I need to think about it. It's a responsible business, you see.}
{396}{}{我需要考虑一下。你知道，这是一项负责任的业务。}
### {397}{}{Agreed. Here are the bottlecaps. And yes, there was no such conversation.}
{397}{}{同意。这是水瓶。是的，没有这样的对话。}
### {398}{}{Don't worry, we'll take care of everything.}
{398}{}{别担心，我们会处理好一切的。}
### {399}{}{I'm counting on you guys.}
{399}{}{我指望你们。}

#Bounty hunting
### {400}{}{I'm interested in finding criminals. For whom and how much do they pay?}
{400}{}{我对寻找罪犯很感兴趣。他们为谁付了多少钱？}
### {401}{}{(sigh) Another bounty hunter...}
{401}{}{（叹气）又是一个赏金猎人。。。}
### {1401}{}{A bounty hunter in a lace apron? Where are we going...}
{1401}{}{一个穿着蕾丝围裙的赏金猎人？我们要去哪里。。。}
### {402}{}{Is something wrong?}
{402}{}{有什么不对劲吗？}
### {1402}{}{Ahem. Should I remind you that your security guard is a woman?}
{1402}{}{嗯。我应该提醒你你的保安是个女人吗？}
### {403}{}{Ah, isn't it you that the whole city is praising for the last matches in the arena? This changes the case.}
{403}{}{啊，难道不是你在为竞技场上的最后一场比赛而欢呼吗？这改变了情况。}

### {408}{}{I can handle it.}
{408}{}{我能应付。}
### {409}{}{There is a bulletin board on the street. It has the latest information. The system is simple. You find the criminal according to the description, bring his head to me and get a reward for it. Any questions? Then go ahead. Good luck.}
{409}{}{街上有一块公告牌。它有最新的信息。这个系统很简单。你根据描述找到罪犯，把他的头带到我面前，并得到奖励。有什么问题吗？那就继续吧。祝你好运}
### {410}{}{See you later, Bruce Turner.}
{410}{}{回头见，布鲁斯・特纳。}
### {411}{}{I want to talk about bounty hunting.}
{411}{}{我想谈谈赏金狩猎。}

### {420}{}{Here is the head of Hernando Aviles.}
{420}{}{这是埃尔南多・阿维莱斯的头像。}
### {421}{}{Ah, this is our old acquaintance, Hernando. Well, will there be no more jokes in my address, you fucking bastard?}
{421}{}{啊，这是我们的老熟人，埃尔南多。好吧，我的地址里不会再有笑话了，你这个混蛋？}
### {422}{}{Here is the head of Chucho Navarro.}
{422}{}{这是Chucho Navarro的头像。}
### {423}{}{Son of a bitch, there was a lot of noise from him. I am glad that his loud mouth will never make a single sound again.}
{423}{}{狗娘养的，他的声音很大。我很高兴他的大嘴巴再也不会发出任何声音了。}
### {424}{}{Here's Aidy Gorme's head.}
{424}{}{这是艾迪・戈姆的脑袋。}
### {425}{}{Eh, but once she was a beauty and performed in a casino. A strange fate. I don't understand what blew her head off.}
{425}{}{呃，但是有一次她是个美人，在赌场里表演。一个奇怪的命运。我不明白是什么让她大吃一惊。}
### {426}{}{[Next]}
{426}{}{[下一个]}
### {427}{}{Hernando Aviles is dead. But I couldn't get his head.}
{427}{}{埃尔南多・阿维莱斯死了。但我无法理解他的想法。}
### {428}{}{Chucho Navarro is dead. But I could not bring his head.}

### {429}{}{Aidy Gorme is dead. Alas, her head was left lying in the desert.}
{429}{}{艾迪・戈姆死了。唉，她的头被丢在沙漠里了。}
### {430}{}{No head, no reward. But I am glad to hear such news. Until the refutation arrives, we will assume that you are telling the truth.}

{435}{}{我不知道，这种活动太危险了。}

### {440}{}{Wait. So it was the last ataman of Los Panchos? The damn gang has finally fallen. Imagine how this news will spread all over Phoenix. Oh, it's going to be a real celebration for the townspeople.}
{440}{}{等待所以这是洛斯潘乔斯的最后一个共济会教徒？这个该死的团伙终于倒台了。想象一下这个消息将如何传遍凤凰城。哦，这将是一个真正的庆祝市民。}
### {441}{}{Certainly. But aren't there other atamans?}
{441}{}{当然但是难道没有其他的共济会教徒吗？}
### {442}{}{These three held the largest and most dangerous clans of Los Panchos. The others didn't pose much of a threat. Now, without their atamans, their entire empire will disintegrate, and ordinary robbers will be greatly weakened. Surely the clans have already declared war on each other, starting the redistribution of influence.}
{442}{}{这三人控制着洛斯潘乔斯最大、最危险的部族。其他人并没有构成太大的威胁。现在，如果没有他们的阿塔曼人，他们的整个帝国将解体，普通的强盗将被大大削弱。毫无疑问，这些部族已经相互宣战，开始重新分配影响力。}
### {443}{}{It's a little weird. But it is even more strange that the chieftains had the same brand as you and your mercenaries.}
{443}{}{这有点奇怪。但更奇怪的是，酋长们与你和你的雇佣兵有着相同的品牌。}
### {444}{}{Hmm. It had to be revealed sometime... We have embellished their legend a little. In fact, these three worked as mercenaries in our guild. They learned a lot here. But having felt the power and authority over people, they stopped being interested in honest work.}
{444}{}{嗯，总有一天会揭晓的。。。我们对他们的传说做了一些修饰。事实上，这三个人在我们公会当过雇佣兵。他们在这里学到了很多。但在感受到了对人的权力和权威后，他们不再对诚实的工作感兴趣。}
### {445}{}{You should have warned me about this.}
{445}{}{你应该警告我这件事的。}
### {446}{}{These people are a disgrace to the guild. We cannot allow our reputation to suffer because of them.}
{446}{}{这些人是公会的耻辱。我们不能让我们的声誉因为他们而受损。}
### {447}{}{This is reasonable.}
{447}{}{这是合理的。}
### {448}{}{Actually, I don't care.}
{448}{}{事实上，我不在乎。}
### {449}{}{You've had enough of completed contracts. For now, rest and have fun. And I'll think about what other job you can leave.}
{449}{}{你已经受够了已经完成的合同。现在，休息并享受乐趣。我会考虑你还能留下什么其他工作。}

{450}{}{更多的工作？太好了，我很期待。}
### {451}{}{I doubt that after what I've heard, I'll want to work for you. Goodbye, Bruce.}
{451}{}{听了这些，我怀疑我是否愿意为你工作。再见，布鲁斯。}
### {452}{}{Well, that's great news.}

### {457}{}{What about a new job?}
{457}{}{找份新工作怎么样？}

### {460}{}{You're just in time. I was about to send for you. There is a new goal. And this time I'm paying a higher price.}
{460}{}{你来得正是时候。我正要派人来接你。有一个新的目标。这次我要付出更高的代价。}
### {461}{}{It's not hard to guess that a new goal is worth that much money. What did he do wrong?}
{461}{}{不难猜测，一个新目标值那么多钱。他做错了什么？}
### {462}{}{(shows the portrait) This is Gil McCord. He is known as one of the best shooters and trackers. He knows his job well and can get out of any scrape. Therefore, he cannot be left alive.}
{462}{}{（展示肖像）这是吉尔・麦科德。他被认为是最好的射手和追踪者之一。他很了解自己的工作，能摆脱任何困难。因此，不能让他活着。}
### {463}{}{Hmm. This is strange. It's like you're not telling me something. Why are mercenaries chasing a mercenary?}
{463}{}{嗯，这很奇怪。你好像什么都没告诉我。为什么雇佣兵在追逐雇佣兵？}
### {464}{}{(sigh) You see, I embellished our merits a little. In fact, the atamans of Los Panchos were once also our mercenaries. They learned a lot and that's why they were able to gain a foothold outside the city.}
{464}{}{（叹气）你看，我把我们的优点修饰了一下。事实上，洛斯潘乔斯的阿塔曼人曾经也是我们的雇佣兵。他们学到了很多，这就是为什么他们能够在城外站稳脚跟。}
### {465}{}{And Gil McCord?}
{465}{}{吉尔・麦考德呢？}
### {466}{}{He was their go-between and spy. This was revealed after we cleaned up the Los Panchos bases. It seems that Gil was too greedy and distrustful, so he worked on both sides to always have a trump ace up his sleeve.}
{466}{}{他是他们的中间人和间谍。这是在我们清理了洛斯潘乔斯基地后发现的。吉尔似乎太贪婪和不信任了，所以他在双方都努力，总是有一张王牌。}
### {467}{}{You should have told the truth about the gang from the beginning.}
{467}{}{你应该从一开始就说实话。}
### {468}{}{These people are a disgrace to the guild. We cannot allow our reputation to suffer because of them.}
{468}{}{这些人是公会的耻辱。我们不能让我们的声誉因为他们而受损。}
### {469}{}{Actually, I don't care.}
{469}{}{事实上，我不在乎。}
### {470}{}{This is reasonable.}
{470}{}{这是合理的。}
### {471}{}{Kill Gil McCord and bring his head.}
{471}{}{杀死吉尔・麦考德，带上他的头。}
### {472}{}{I'll do it. You can count on me.}
{472}{}{我会做的。你可以相信我。}

### {1474}{}{I've done your dirty work. Here's his head.}
{1474}{}{我干了你的脏活。这是他的头。}
### {475}{}{(nods sadly) Gil McCord. You were one of us. And that's what greed has brought you to. His story will serve as an example to others. You're owed 750 caps, as we agreed. I really hope that this amount will not turn your head, as it turned Gila. And from now on, try not to spread about our little secret.}
{475}{}{（悲伤地点点头）吉尔・麦考德。你是我们中的一员。这就是贪婪带给你的。他的故事将成为其他人的榜样。按照我们的约定，你欠了750顶帽子。我真的希望这个数额不会像吉拉那样让你头疼。从现在开始，尽量不要散布我们的小秘密。}
### {476}{}{No problem, boss. Goodbye.}
{476}{}{没问题，老板。再见}
### {477}{}{After everything you've seen? I won't even take a step here.}

### {482}{}{None yet.}
{482}{}{还没有。}
### {483}{}{How do I find him?}
{483}{}{我该怎么找到他？}
### {484}{}{I doubt he's in town. In addition, our agents report that a man similar in description was seen leaving for the south with a caravan. There aren't many settlements there, you can check them all.}
{484}{}{我怀疑他在城里。此外，我们的特工报告称，有人看到一名描述相似的男子带着一辆大篷车前往南方。那里的定居点不多，你可以全部查看。}

### {505}{}{Oh, I'd rather not know about it. Let's change the subject, okay?}
{505}{}{哦，我宁愿不知道。我们换个话题吧，好吗？}
### {506}{}{You know, this is a very expensive thing. And you're not in our guild yet. Considering all the costs, it will cost 50,000 caps. But after the course you will be able to make good money on all sorts of garbage.}
{506}{}{你知道，这是一件非常昂贵的东西。而且你还没有加入我们的公会。考虑到所有成本，它将花费50000顶。但课程结束后，你将能够在各种垃圾上赚大钱。}
