{100}{}{Welcome to Golden Valley stranger. I'm sheriff Milton and with the help of my men, we're keeping things in
 order here. Same rules for everyone, this is no place for troublemakers. Drugs are out of the question either.
 If you got a problem with someone or something, you talk to me, just don't get yourself into trouble. Any questions?}
#
{101}{}{Got any job for me?}
{102}{}{What can you tell me about this town?}
{103}{}{Nothing at the moment.}
#job
{104}{}{Talk to me when you're in better shape. It would be a shame to see you get beaten up any worse.}
#
{105}{}{Sure thing, sheriff.}
#
{106}{}{Yes, I do have something for you but I'm not sure you can handle yourself in any situation. So I have to ask
 about the type of job you think you can manage?}
#
{107}{}{Usually I negotiate, but if it comes down to it, I'm good with small arms. I've been practicing for quite some time.}
#guns
{109}{}{All right then. I think I have something that needs to be taken care of. Here's what's going on. Some of the
 locals are complaining about a bunch of suspicious guys hanging around the old gold mine, harassing people.
 However, I'm more worried about some citizens who went missing and were supposedly last seen in that area. Find out
 what happened. You'll be working on your own for now, we don't want to draw too much attention.}
#
{110}{}{I'm on it.}
{111}{}{On second thought, I'll be back when I'm ready to take the job.}
#back, job not taken
{112}{}{About that job...}
#
{113}{}{Yes?}
#
{114}{}{I'll take it.}
#
{115}{}{Okay then. I told you about the situation, so get to it!}
#
{116}{}{Anything useful about what happened to those missing citizens?}
{117}{}{I'm afraid still nothing useful.}
#discover something
{118}{}{Those bullies from the old mine are practically a harmless bunch. I doubt they could be involved in
 kidnapping or even killing anyone. Their so called leader Keel thinks Mr. Basil is responsible for these crimes.
 Furthermore he claims Mr. Basil is keeping his victims locked up somewhere.}
{119}{}{I found out those smugglers in the old mine are responsible for the kidnappings. They probably killed all of
 the hostages since they had no use for them. I'm sure accusing Mr. Basil was just a cover up story for the whole mess.}
#118
{120}{}{I find this very hard to believe. This leader must have some serious grudge against this man. You just don't go
 around accusing a well known and respected member of the community. Can you say you're absolutely sure Mr. Basil
 is somehow involved, and believe it? Better question, yet, did this Keel provide any evidence to support his claims?}
#
{121}{}{Not that I know of...}
#
{122}{}{Those are serious accusations... but it caught my attention as he mentioned Mr. Basil. I'll have to look
 into it. [Starts walking up and down.] There's only one thing we can do right now, to keep an eye on Mr. Basil, see if
 anything sticks out of the ordinary. Are you up to some detective work, we don't actually get paid for this but law
 enforcement has its benefits...}
#
{123}{}{Sure, I don't mind. I just want to help.}
#
{124}{}{}
#119
{125}{}{So those smugglers are responsible? I thought so. They always looked suspicious to me. We should hurry if
 we want to catch them off guard. I'm not gonna let them hurt another person, not on my watch!}
#
{126}{}{Let's go!}
#about this place
{127}{}{This town got its name mainly because of this valley. The "golden" part stayed since this place was once
 famous for its natural resources, which was gold. But since we ran out of it, can't say tourism is flourishing. Town was
 founded about two hundred years ago by our first mayor whose statue can be seen on the main square, west of here.
 We don't have any public happenings or fairs, people simply lost their interest since we're all trying to survive. Couple
 of years ago some caravans used to stop by but I haven't seen any for a long time. You might want to go visit the fun
 house, 20th century games are still very popular here. Just watch yourself, you can occasionally run into a wild animal
 at night. Lots of outsiders but less friendly faces. I'm doing my best but... there's just too much to do.}
#
{128}{}{Thanks. That's more than I needed to know.}
#
{129}{}{Welcome back stranger. What can I do for you?}
#Basil
{130}{}{Got anything to report?}
#
{131}{}{Nothing.}
#job about marys drinks
{132}{}{Why don't you allow Mary to sell drinks in her casino?}
#
{133}{}{Because I've had problems with her customers in the past. She doesn't care what kind of people her
 business attracts, all she gives a damn about is money. And because of that, anybody can enter her casino, no matter
 their gear, mind-set or condition. And when it's filled with all kind of scum from the wasteland, there's always a fight
 or two breaking out. I could not tolerate that, so I did what had to be done. It helped more than I had anticipated.}
{134}{}{If she introduces a stricter policy towards her customers, is there a chance you could grant her permission
 to sell drinks again? She has to cover her losses after all.}
{135}{}{I understand, but trust me sheriff, her intentions are honest.}
# trust me..
{136}{}{You've got to be kidding me. I could trust almost anyone - but her? All I know is Mary will never agree to
 lower her income for the sake of public safety. I know her too well... If you are really concerned about this, make sure
 she doesn't do something she may later regret.}
{137}{}{Understood, sheriff.}
{138}{}{To hell with you! New laws are being made around here, right now!}
#changes her policy...
{139}{}{If she decides to make such a move, I will help her with a permit - and her customers. That's my job after all.}
{140}{}{Thanks, sheriff.}
# good with fists...
{141}{}{I'm good with my fists. I can take out almost anything with these two. They never let me down.}
#
{142}{}{Alright, you'll do just fine. Here's the situation... I've got a problem with one of the locals. His name is
 Bob but people call him "Crazy Booze". He is constantly getting drunk so badly he stumbles on the street, walks
 disoriented and yells a lot. Once he broke into someone's house, fortunately nobody was home at the time. He could've
 got himself killed... I want him behind bars immediately. Find that drunkass and bring him here!}
{143}{}{Yes, sir.}
#
{144}{}{I don't see Bob behind those bars. Did you find him?}
{145}{}{Not yet.}
#
{146}{}{Excellent work stranger! I plan to keep him here for a while, until he sobers up... well, probably longer. I
 don't want to see him reaching out for booze minutes after leaving his cell. When he gets out, he'll be as good as new.
 Thanks again.}
{147}{}{No problem, sheriff.}
# job...
{148}{}{I still can't believe Mr. Basil did this. We were so naive to let his generous gestures and donations leave us
 completely blind. I had my doubts but others made me let my guard down and believe what I saw. What I did not see,
 was far worse than I could ever imagine. [Sighs.] But slavery, in this town...}
{149}{}{Unfortunately it's true. I managed to rescue most of the captives but I'm afraid for some it was too late.
 Can't say for sure what happened to the others, whether they were moved to another location or else.}
#
{150}{}{Don't worry about that, I'll send my men to search for each and every one of them... I just can't let go of the
 thought it all happened in front of our noses, all the things they had to endure. It's just overwhelming. [Kicks his
 desk.] Damn it! }
{151}{}{Don't be hard on yourself. We won a battle today. If we keep it that way, one step forward at a time, there is
 hope.}
#
{152}{}{You're right. Only decisive actions can guarantee success. It's a long road ahead but better start walking while
 we have the strength. I'd like you to stay for a while, good men are hard to find... [he sighs]... and the help is much
 needed, especially these days. I've got a feeling the worst is yet to come.}
{153}{}{Will do. Take care sheriff.}
#
{154}{}{Nice to see you again. What can I do for you?}
#
{155}{}{Can I ask you something?}
#
{156}{}{Sure thing, partner.}
{157}{}{Actually, there's nothing I need right now.}
#basil killed long before...
{158}{}{I've managed to rescue some captives who were locked up under Basil's place...}
#lavander quest
{159}{}{One of the books from the library is missing. Jasmine asked me to find it.}
#
{160}{}{Hm, I might be able to help you with that. [Searches through his locker]...}
{161}{}{[Wait.]}
#
{162}{}{[Few seconds later, he takes out a book from a pile.] Is this what you're looking for? My man found it lying
 on the floor in Bob's house.}
{163}{}{Looks like it, thanks sheriff.}
{164}{}{[You look at the book.] I'm not sure... but I'll take it.}
{165}{}{Talk to you later, I have to check something first.}
#164
{166}{}{[Pulls the book out of your hand.] ...then it stays here. Everything we find is going to be returned to it's
 rightful owner, otherwise it's called stealing.}
{167}{}{I don't care, just give me the damn book.}
{168}{}{Since when... ah, forget it.}
#
{169}{}{[Takes out the same book from his locker.] Are you sure this time?}
{170}{}{Yes, definitely. Thanks.}
{171}{}{Well, still can't tell for sure.}
#Bob gets killed, after 144
{172}{}{I found Bob's dead body in his bed. This time he drank himself to death. Apparently, he choked on his own
 vomit while sleeping.}
#if success, speech 45%
{173}{}{[Sighs.] His days of self abuse finally caught up with him. I don't believe he had any relatives that I know of
 but he made sure nobody will miss him. What a pitiful way to go, poor bastard.}
#if NOT success, same speech check
{174}{}{You know... [sighs] his house is just across the street!? And [glowers]... some people saw you arguing with
 Bob. Tell me, was that about the time you found his body?}
{175}{}{You can't know, you weren't there!}
{176}{}{You think you know everything!? Why don't you tell me!}
{177}{}{I see where this is going... [Run for it.]} #hostility
#after 173
{178}{}{You know what they say, what goes around comes around. See you later.}
{179}{}{Oh, I'm sure somebody, somewhere will miss him. But life goes on and so must we.}
# 175, 176...
{180}{}{I'll tell you what I know! You are in some serious deep shit, punk! Hand over your weapons, you're about to
 have some quality time in the slammer.}
{181}{}{Shit! We'll see each other again, you hear me!} #dude goes to jail
{182}{}{Screw you, I'm not finished yet!} #hostility
#float line, dude from jail
{183}{}{“As you know, madness is like gravity... all it takes is a little push.”} #mandatory
#
{184}{}{Hold it right there you son of a bitch! I'm not done with you!}
{185}{}{Getting comfortable? Your ass will stay there for a while!}
{186}{}{[Speech: }
{187}{}{Although Bob's personal life choices didn't cause his early demise, you sure made it official. You gain 50 exp.
 points.}
{188}{}{You helped sheriff Milton to take Bob into custody. You earn 100 exp. points.}
{189}{}{You have stopped Basil's slave operation. You earn 1500 exp. points.}
