#{284}{}{That's a shame. I actually have some experience. I've already played a role in solving over five serious cases in my journey.}
{284}{}{真可惜。我确实有一些经验。在我的旅程中，我已经为解决五起以上的严重案件发挥了作用。 -- That's a shame. I actually have some experience. I've already played a role in solving over five serious cases in my journey.}
#{285}{}{Ahem. If you do have an experience, then, I guess, I could tell you the details.}
{285}{}{啊哼。如果你确实有经验，那么，我想，我可以告诉你细节。 -- Ahem. If you do have an experience, then, I guess, I could tell you the details.}
#{300}{}{I'm here for a personal issue. An acquaintance of mine, a sandwich vendor, has a debt she's having trouble settling. Could you help?}
{300}{}{我是来处理个人问题的。我的一个熟人，一个卖三明治的小贩，欠了一笔债，她很难还清。你能帮忙吗？ -- I'm here for a personal issue. An acquaintance of mine, a sandwich vendor, has a debt she's having trouble settling. Could you help?}
#{301}{}{As a fellow human being, I am very sorry about your friend. But she has obligations which needed to be followed. Before taking the loan she should have read the agreement.}
{301}{}{作为人类同胞，我对你的朋友感到非常抱歉。但她有义务要履行。在接受贷款之前，她应该先看一下协议书。 -- As a fellow human being, I am very sorry about your friend. But she has obligations which needed to be followed. Before taking the loan she should have read the agreement.}
#{302}{}{But it's only thanks to the immense pays that she can't get any profits. Could the Clean City give her a few months? She could expand her business and provide more money to the budget.}
{302}{}{但是，只有由于巨额的工资，她才能得到任何利润。清洁城市能给她几个月吗？她可以扩大业务，为预算提供更多的资金。 -- But it's only thanks to the immense pays that she can't get any profits. Could the Clean City give her a few months? She could expand her business and provide more money to the budget.}
#{303}{}{I'll be frank - it's not my responsibility. I can't spend my time convincing the city council to change the contract of some minor trader. She should put an application to the administration, so it could be processed according to the procedures.}
{303}{}{坦白说，这不是我的责任。我不能花时间说服市议会改变某个小商人的合同。她应该向行政部门提出申请，以便按照程序处理。 -- I'll be frank - it's not my responsibility. I can't spend my time convincing the city council to change the contract of some minor trader. She should put an application to the administration, so it could be processed according to the procedures.}
#{304}{}{Is that so?.. Well, I have a business of my own here - I'm selling Nuka-Cola. I could pledge some of my own product if the layoff won't bear any results.}
{304}{}{是这样吗？。。嗯，我在这里有自己的生意――我在卖努卡可乐。如果裁员不会产生任何结果，我可以保证自己的一些产品。 -- Is that so?.. Well, I have a business of my own here - I'm selling Nuka-Cola. I could pledge some of my own product if the layoff won't bear any results.}
#{305}{}{I know about business, so I think I can convince your Council in profits from this, using real statistics.}
{305}{}{我了解商业，所以我想我可以用真实的数据说服你们委员会从中获利。 -- I know about business, so I think I can convince your Council in profits from this, using real statistics.}
#{306}{}{It is way better to give the trader a postponement than to loose income from her taxes forever. I think I can convince your Council.}
{306}{}{推迟交易者的交税时间要比永远减少交税收入要好得多。我想我可以说服你的委员会。 -- It is way better to give the trader a postponement than to loose income from her taxes forever. I think I can convince your Council.}

{309}{}{好吧，看来你不能被说服。那样的话，我就走了。 -- Well, looks like you can't be convinced. In that case, I'll be going.}
#{310}{}{I don't see any reason to do so. The council simply won't listen to you without some powerful arguments. If you, for instance, would have had a business in Vegas, or your name carried any weight in the city, then you might have had some hope to affect the decisions of some members.}
{310}{}{我看不出有什么理由这么做。如果没有有力的论据，委员会根本不会听你的。例如，如果你在维加斯有一家公司，或者你的名字在维加斯有任何影响力，那么你可能有希望影响一些会员的决定。 -- I don't see any reason to do so. The council simply won't listen to you without some powerful arguments. If you, for instance, would have had a business in Vegas, or your name carried any weight in the city, then you might have had some hope to affect the decisions of some members.}
#{311}{}{Hmm... This certainly changes things. I'll give the word and you give the documents to my secretary.}
{311}{}{隐马尔可夫模型。。。这当然改变了一切。我说了算，你把文件交给我的秘书。 -- Hmm... This certainly changes things. I'll give the word and you give the documents to my secretary.}

#{313}{}{I'd like to sort some things out on my end first.}
{313}{}{我想先把我这边的一些事情整理一下。 -- I'd like to sort some things out on my end first.}
#{314}{}{Hmm... I don't think the council will listen to a small-time trader.}
{314}{}{隐马尔可夫模型。。。我不认为议会会听取一个小商人的意见。 -- Hmm... I don't think the council will listen to a small-time trader.}
#{315}{}{You look like you could hold your point of view even against the hardheaded council members. I'll give the word, and my secretary will arrange the documents. Everything else depends on you.}
{315}{}{你看起来可以坚持你的观点，甚至反对顽固的安理会成员。我会告诉你的，我的秘书会整理文件。其他一切都取决于你。 -- You look like you could hold your point of view even against the hardheaded council members. I'll give the word, and my secretary will arrange the documents. Everything else depends on you.}

{1178}{}{是的，我确信我收集了足够的证据来解释一切。 -- Yes, I'm sure I gathered enough evidence to explain everything.}
#{1180}{}{I suppose, I should begin by saying that our mysterious suspect has a major influence on the Las Vegas city police.

I didn't manage to figure out who or what made him carry that, but it is obvious that it wasn't his own initiative.}
{1180}{}{我想，我应该先说我们的神秘嫌犯对拉斯维加斯市警方有重大影响。我在部门里问了几个问题后不久，一位视察员在清洁城市门口迎接了我。他接到命令要杀我。我没能弄清楚是谁或是什么让他带着那个，但很明显，这不是他自己的主动。 -- I suppose, I should begin by saying that our mysterious suspect has a major influence on the Las Vegas city police.

#{1272}{}{Although the lab uses slaves as a labor and a guinea pigs for testing new products, which itself could point at the connection to the slave guild, there are no names in the lab's records.

{1272}{}{尽管该实验室使用奴隶作为劳动力，并用豚鼠来测试新产品，这本身就可能指向与奴隶公会的联系，但在实验室的记录中没有名字。但我想我们可以把这些怪胎从嫌疑犯名单上抹去――我在奴隶城找到了文件，里面有人想让他们制造毒品。我把它给了奥斯卡・戴维斯。 -- Although the lab uses slaves as a labor and a guinea pigs for testing new products, which itself could point at the connection to the slave guild, there are no names in the lab's records.
