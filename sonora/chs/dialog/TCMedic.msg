### {301}{}{(looks around in bewilderment) Is it?}
{301}{}{（困惑地环顾四周）是吗？}
### {302}{}{Doc, I'm afraid to ask, but... how many of your patients survived surgery?}
{302}{}{医生，我不敢问，但是...你的病人中有多少人在手术中幸存下来？}
### {303}{}{Wait, I'll turn on the statistics analyzer... There is. 58 percent.}
{303}{}{等等，我打开统计分析器...有.58%。}
### {304}{}{So... a little more than half.}
{304}{}{所以…一点点超过一半。}
### {305}{}{This is not a place where people get to with light scratches. Most patients come with severe injuries. In second place is an electric shock. And then - radiation, breathing problems, decreased vision, diarrhea...}
{305}{}{这不是一个有轻微划痕的地方。大多数病人伤势严重。排在第二位的是触电。然后-辐射，呼吸问题，视力下降，腹泻...}
### {306}{}{Uh, I see, doc. You don't have to continue...}
{306}{}{我明白了，医生。你不必继续...}

### {310}{}{Tell me about the clinic.}
{310}{}{告诉我诊所的情况。}
### {311}{}{This is a hospital, not a bar.}
{311}{}{这是一家医院，不是酒吧。}
### {312}{}{How did you become a doctor?}
{312}{}{你是如何成为一名医生的？}
### {313}{}{My predecessor tried to install a neuroimplant to improve his medical skills. Something went wrong and he died of a brain hemorrhage. My brothers needed a new doctor, and then I was sent to study with the Followers of the Apocalypse. I have been serving here ever since.}
{313}{}{我的前任试图安装一个神经植入物来提高他的医疗技能。出了问题，他死于脑出血。我的兄弟们需要一位新医生，然后我被送到启示录追随者那里学习。从那以后我一直在这里服务。}
### {314}{}{Where did you get the medicines from?}
{314}{}{你从哪里买的药？}
### {315}{}{The old pre-war drugs are mostly brought by caravans from Phoenix. And the new ones are from a small laboratory in Casa Nueva. They have their own production there.}
{315}{}{战前的旧毒品大多是由凤凰城的大篷车带来的。新的是来自Casa Nueva的一个小实验室。他们在那里有自己的产品。}
### {316}{}{Who are these Followers of the Apocalypse?}
{316}{}{这些启示录的追随者是谁？}
### {317}{}{I would call them fanatics obsessed with the knowledge of the Old World. However, knowledge is useless without technology.}
{317}{}{我会称他们为痴迷于旧世界知识的狂热分子。然而，没有技术，知识是无用的。}

### {320}{}{Why do tinsmiths implant electronics in themselves?}
{320}{}{为什么锡匠会在自己身上植入电子产品？}
### {321}{}{The human body is fragile and vulnerable. By replacing parts with electronics, we are trying to protect ourselves, become stronger, smarter and more viable. The dream of every tinker is to achieve complete cybernetization and digitization of personality. But this, unfortunately, is an unattainable ideal.}
{321}{}{人体是脆弱的。通过用电子产品取代零件，我们正在努力保护自己，变得更强大、更智能、更可行。每个锡匠的梦想都是实现人格的完全网络化和数字化。但不幸的是，这是一个遥不可及的理想。}

### {330}{}{What happened to this patient?}
{330}{}{这个病人怎么了？}
### {331}{}{He's seriously injured. To save him, I tried to install a couple of implants and prostheses. But the fragile human body rejects technology. He can't survive without implants, but he dies with them. Evil irony.}
{331}{}{他受了重伤。为了救他，我试着安装了几个植入物和假肢。但脆弱的人体拒绝技术。没有植入物，他无法生存，但他会死于植入物。邪恶的讽刺。}
### {332}{}{Can it be cured?}
{332}{}{它能治好吗？}
### {333}{}{Fix it? I'm afraid not. It will have to be "dismantled".}
{333}{}{修复它？恐怕不会。它将不得不被“拆除”。}
### {334}{}{Can I try it?}
{334}{}{我可以试试吗？}
### {335}{}{If our high-tech medicine can't cure him, then your savage rituals won't help any more. But I don't mind interfering in such a hopeless situation.}
{335}{}{如果我们的高科技药物不能治愈他，那么你野蛮的仪式也无济于事。但我不介意在这种无望的情况下干涉。}

{336}{}{让我们看看我的“仪式”能做什么，博士。}
### {337}{}{Let's talk about something less pessimistic.}
{337}{}{让我们谈谈不那么悲观的事情。}
