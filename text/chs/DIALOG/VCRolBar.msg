#{100}{}{You see a merchant.}
{100}{}{你看到一个商人。}
#{101}{}{You see a street peddler. With her rustic look and worn out clothes she stands out among the rest of the environment.}
{101}{}{你看见一个街头小贩。她乡下的样子和破旧的衣服使她在周围的环境中脱颖而出。}
#{102}{}{If you are here to molest me, I'll call the police!}
{102}{}{如果你来骚扰我，我就报警！}
#{103}{}{Please, don't come near me! I don't want problems with the police!}
{103}{}{拜托，别靠近我！我不想和警察有麻烦！}
#{110}{}{[At the sight of you approaching, a street peddler makes an effort to force a smile upon her tired tanned face] Come here! Sandwiches, hot, delicious!}
{110}{}{[一看到你走近，一个街头小贩努力在她疲惫的晒黑的脸上挤出一个微笑]过来！三明治，热的，好吃的！}
#{111}{}{How much is for one sandwich?}
{111}{}{一个三明治多少钱？}
#{112}{}{$35. I only accept cash.}
{112}{}{$35. 我只收现金。}
#{113}{}{Here is the money. Give me one.}
{113}{}{这是钱。给我一个。}
#{114}{}{Uh, another time. Bye.}
{114}{}{呃，下次吧。再见。}
#{115}{}{Good bye.}
{115}{}{再见。}
#{116}{}{Well, that's great, but can we just chat?}
{116}{}{好吧，那太好了，但我们能聊聊吗？}
#{117}{}{Would you like a sandwich? The price has not changed: $35.}
{117}{}{你想吃三明治吗？价格没有变化：35美元。}
#{118}{}{[Craftily assembles you a fresh sandwich] Here you go. Want more?}
{118}{}{[巧妙地为你准备了一个新鲜的三明治]给你。想要更多吗？}
#{119}{}{Yes, please.}
{119}{}{好的，谢谢。}
#{120}{}{But this is not enough... Look, this job is already too exhausting to give away food for free.}
{120}{}{但这还不够。。。听着，这份工作已经太累了，不能免费赠送食物了。}
#{121}{}{I understand...}
{121}{}{我理解。。。}
#{122}{}{I see. Now give me one sandwich.}
{122}{}{我懂了。现在给我一个三明治。}
#{150}{}{[Her look becomes especially tired] To chat... About what?}
{150}{}{[她的表情变得特别疲惫]聊天。。。关于什么？}
#{151}{}{On second thoughts, give me your brand sandwich. Here's $35.}
{151}{}{再想一想，把你的名牌三明治给我。这是35美元。}
#{152}{}{I'll chat with you later. Now I gotta go.}
{152}{}{我待会再和你聊。现在我得走了。}
#{153}{}{You seem very tired. Must be trading for quite some time?}
{153}{}{你看起来很累。一定要交易很长时间？}
#{154}{}{Yes... I'm not slacking here, I'm working. I have to work for 12 hours a day just to pay for the right to trade.}
{154}{}{对。。。我不是在这里偷懒，我是在工作。我必须每天工作12个小时来支付交易权。}
#{155}{}{The right to trade... Wait, what's this?}
{155}{}{贸易权。。。等等，这是什么？}
#{156}{}{That's how it is. The Clean City takes a toll for the right to sell goods here. It's quite large... No, the truth is, it's a real robbery. But I have little choice.}
{156}{}{事情就是这样。清洁城市要为这里的商品销售权付出代价。它相当大。。。不，事实是，这是一场真正的抢劫。但我别无选择。}
#{157}{}{Why so?}
{157}{}{为什么会这样？}
#{158}{}{In the Clean City one does not have to worry about security, the order is maintained by the police. In addition, there are more people and they are richer, hence more income. But it is not even that. My father made a deal with the City Hall in order to restore the farm. And now we have to pay our part of the deal. We have to endure inhuman conditions.}
{158}{}{在清洁的城市里，人们不必担心安全问题，秩序是由警察维持的。另外，人多了，也更富了，收入也就多了。但事实并非如此。我父亲与市政厅达成了一项协议，以恢复农场。现在我们必须支付我们的那部分。我们必须忍受不人道的条件。}
#{159}{}{The deal? Tell me more. And what do these "inhuman conditions" imply?}
{159}{}{交易？告诉我更多。这些“不人道的条件”意味着什么？}
#{160}{}{Well... [sighs] My father owned a farm, but after he went broke he appealed to the City Hall for help. He was given a loan with the condition of repayment with interest. The interest rate is just awful! And it increases with each day of the payment delay. But those chair warmers in the City Hall couldn't be more happy about it because, as one can say, now they own both: us and the farm.}
{160}{}{好。。。我父亲有一个农场，但破产后他向市政厅求助。他得到了一笔贷款，条件是还本付息。利率太糟糕了！并且它随着付款延迟的每一天而增加。但是市政厅里的那些暖椅子的人对此再高兴不过了，因为可以说，现在他们拥有了我们和农场。}
#{161}{}{What an unfair matter. Maybe someone in the City Hall would give you a pass? A grace period, for example.}
{161}{}{多不公平的事啊。也许市政厅的人会给你通行证？例如，宽限期。}
#{162}{}{It's unlikely. Do you know someone there? If you knew, you would understand. Those jokers haven't crawled outside of the City for like a dozen of years. They don't know how hard it is to live in the wastelands. That's besides the fact that they don't care. They are already used to push people around.}
{162}{}{不太可能。你认识那里的人吗？如果你知道，你就会明白。那些小丑已经有十几年没出过城了。他们不知道住在荒地里有多难。除此之外，他们也不在乎。它们已经被用来推人了。}
#{163}{}{What happened to the farm?}
{163}{}{农场怎么了？}
#{164}{}{At first, we were raided by the rodents, then the actual raiders came, and then the hurricane happened. The barn was blown to pieces, not to mention the crops. We barely could collect a bag of maize back then. Now we need to restore everything, the buildings and the plantation.}
{164}{}{起初，我们遭到啮齿动物的袭击，后来真正的袭击者来了，然后飓风就发生了。谷仓被炸得粉碎，更不用说庄稼了。那时我们几乎收不到一袋玉米。现在我们需要修复一切，建筑物和种植园。}
#{165}{}{How trading here will help you with the harvest there?}
{165}{}{这里的贸易将如何帮助你在那里收获？}
#{166}{}{We have a big and strong family. While men are busy working in the wastelands, I'm sent here to trade. We need urban goods. Sometimes it is possible to make a deal with the prospectors, but they are not quite pleasant people. They may cheat you.}
{166}{}{我们有一个强大的大家庭。当人们在荒地里忙着干活的时候，我被派到这里来做生意。我们需要城市商品。有时与探矿者达成交易是可能的，但他们不是很讨人喜欢的人。他们可能会欺骗你。}
#{167}{}{Let's chat a bit more?}
{167}{}{我们再聊一会吧？}
#{168}{}{}
{168}{}{}
#{169}{}{Tell me the story of your family.}
{169}{}{告诉我你家的故事。}
#{170}{}{Well, we have a big family, live on a farm outside the city. Over the last ten years we were engaged in farming. What else is there to tell?}
{170}{}{我们有一个大家庭，住在城外的农场里。在过去的十年里，我们从事农业。还有什么好说的？}
#{171}{}{The last ten years? But what was before that?}
{171}{}{过去十年？但在那之前是什么？}
#{172}{}{We roamed for three or four years. We came from the South. The life there was hard, so we had to leave our homes. When we got to Vegas, the place was a real hole. Nothing remarkable - no electricity, no casino. But in ten years the city has greatly changed.}
{172}{}{我们流浪了三四年。我们来自南方。那里的生活很艰苦，所以我们不得不离开家。当我们到维加斯的时候，那地方真是一团糟。没什么了不起的-没有电，没有赌场。但是十年来这个城市发生了很大的变化。}
#{173}{}{Wait, how all this splendor could have been built in such a short time?}
{173}{}{等等，这么短的时间怎么能建成这么辉煌？}
#{174}{}{With slave labour, of course. The slaves were brought here in big crowds, so they could restore the city. What a heavy work they had. But look at the result!}
{174}{}{当然是奴隶劳动。奴隶们成群结队地被带到这里，这样他们就可以恢复城市。他们的工作多繁重啊。但看看结果！}
#{175}{}{Why do you accept only money?}
{175}{}{你为什么只收钱？}
#{176}{}{I need to pay for the loan, so I have to convert the food into money. They won't take the payment with sandwiches in the City Hall, right?.}
{176}{}{我需要付贷款，所以我得把食物换成钱。他们不会在市政厅吃三明治的，对吧？。}
#{180}{}{What a fancy cart you have.}
{180}{}{你的手推车真漂亮。}
#{181}{}{Yep. Previously, such carts were used by the merchants selling hot dogs, and now it's my turn. My brothers found it among the ruins of the old city, repaired it and repainted. Quite a handy thing, if only not this damn wheel...}
{181}{}{是的。以前卖热狗的商户都用这种推车，现在轮到我了。我的兄弟们在旧城的废墟中找到了它，修缮了它，重新粉刷了一遍。很方便的事，如果不是这个该死的轮子。。。}
#{182}{}{Yeah, I have noticed that the cart isn't standing evenly. Maybe I can fix it?}
{182}{}{是的，我注意到手推车站得不均匀。也许我能修好它？}
#{183}{}{Well, you can try. If it's fixed, I'll give you a sandwich. Just don't break it completely!}
{183}{}{嗯，你可以试试。如果修好了，我就给你一个三明治。只是不要完全打破它！}
#{184}{}{I'll try.}
{184}{}{我试试看。}
#{185}{}{Now the cart is all right.}
{185}{}{现在车好了。}
#{186}{}{Indeed! Thank you very much. Here, take it, very hot, fresh-made.}
{186}{}{的确！非常感谢你。来，拿着，很烫，刚做的。}
#{187}{}{You're welcome.}
{187}{}{不客气。}
#{188}{}{Let's talk about something else.}
{188}{}{我们再谈点别的吧。}
#{190}{}{I managed to get a reprieve for your loan.}
{190}{}{我设法得到了你贷款的缓刑。}
#{191}{}{Really!? What a surprise... We needed this reprieve so bad! But I don't know how to thank you. Except, maybe I can make you a free sandwich.}
{191}{}{真正地！？真是个惊喜。。。我们太需要这个缓刑了！但我不知道该怎么感谢你。不过，也许我可以给你做个免费的三明治。}
#{192}{}{You don't need to worry. As about the sandwich - I'll take it.}
{192}{}{你不用担心。至于三明治-我要了。}
