This guy's soft gaze makes you feel depressed. As you want to leave, he starts to talk] Hey, what are you looking at?! Another one in line to spit into my face?}
{10}{}{[你看到一个身陷囹圄的男人。他有一副阴森森的样子：他的左眼眯着，好像在怀疑什么，门牙少了一些。这家伙柔和的目光让你感到沮丧。当你想离开时，他开始说话]嘿，你在看什么？！又是一个排队朝我脸上吐口水的人？}

{30}{}{哈哈哈哈！是的，对。。。不，这是个好问题，真的――我只是自己在想。我想我只是在等有人来放我出去。}

{60}{}{我为什么要把我的话泄露给天知道的人？[他停下来想]不过，我失去了什么？你真的有兴趣听这个吗？}
### {61}{008}{Yes. }
{61}{008}{对}
### {62}{013}{I could try. Or I'll go.}
{62}{013}{我可以试试。否则我就去。}


### {70}{}{Not exactly. Someone's been stealing the canned food from the warehouse, and I'm the suspect. You know, the warehouse. Near the factory. There's also a room of our sadistic doctor Hinder in it... By the way, I'm Skeet, the warehouse supervisor. Guarded, keep in mind, fuckin' warehouse. Fort Knox, my ass.}
{70}{}{不完全是。有人从仓库里偷罐头食品，而我就是嫌疑犯。你知道，仓库。工厂附近。里面还有我们虐待狂医生辛德的房间…顺便说一句，我是斯基特，仓库主管。有警卫，记住，他妈的仓库。诺克斯堡，我的屁股。}
### {71}{011}{I'm }

{73}{012}{我真的希望你不要把它放在某种神秘的力量上，是吗？}


### {80}{}{Man... [he heavily sighs] That's how it is: I'm in charge of the warehouse near the factory, the name is Skeet. The warehouse is full of canned food. [He snaps, raising his voice] Some piece of shit is regularly skimming these cans! He's doing it pretty well! Of course, everyone around thinks it's me. The thefts are still going, even now - but no one is listening to me, let alone has a desire to help. They say I have an accomplice. [he powerfully spits on the floor]}
{80}{}{伙计…（他重重地叹了口气）事情就是这样的：我负责工厂附近的仓库，名字叫斯基特。仓库里堆满了罐头食品。[他厉声说道，提高了声音]有些大便经常掠过这些罐子！他做得很好！当然，周围的每个人都认为是我。即使是现在，盗窃仍在继续――但没有人听我的，更不用说有帮助的欲望了。他们说我有同谋。[他用力地吐在地板上]}
### {81}{999}{Okay, I'll go and try to find out something. }
{81}{999}{好吧，我去试着找出一些东西。}
### {82}{999}{Won't make any promises, but if I learn something, I'll let you know.}

### {112}{999}{Won't make any promises, but if I learn something, I'll let you know. And I think you are pretty tense. Let's try this - I'll go and try to find out things, and you stay here and pull your lever, okay? [leave, listening to his angry screams]}
{112}{999}{不会做出任何承诺，但如果我学到了什么，我会告诉你的。我觉得你很紧张。让我们试试这个-我去试着找出事情，你留在这里，拉动你的杠杆，好吗？[听着他愤怒的尖叫声离开]}


### {120}{}{Holy shoe! Brilliant! This is definitely the doings of witches of the desert!}
{120}{}{神圣的鞋子！明亮的这绝对是沙漠中女巫的所作所为！}
### {121}{014}{That explains everything! Elementary! One question though, what is it in that pipe you smoking?}
{121}{014}{这说明了一切！初级的不过有一个问题，你抽的烟斗里是什么？}
### {122}{013}{Enough with the jokes, tired of them. Unlike you, I'm here voluntarily. I step out that door, and you are all by yourself.}
{122}{013}{受够了这些笑话，厌倦了它们。不像你，我是自愿来的。我走出那扇门，你们就一个人了。}


### {130}{}{Okay, okay. Listen, some asshole set me up: he steals the cans from factory warehouse at nights, with extreme success, mind that, and everyone else thinks it's my doing. Even after they put me here, the cans are still getting stolen - and what do they think? Of course, that I persuaded someone to continue doing it, to throw the suspicions off me! And that's all I have to tell, basically... Listen, If you can help in any way that would make me free, I won't forget that.}
{130}{}{好的，好的。听着，有个混蛋陷害了我：他晚上从工厂仓库偷罐头，非常成功，记住，其他人都认为这是我干的。即使在他们把我放在这里之后，罐头仍然被盗――他们怎么想？当然，我说服了某人继续这样做，以消除我的怀疑！这就是我要说的全部，基本上。。。听着，如果你能以任何方式帮助我，让我自由，我不会忘记的。}
### {131}{999}{Now we're talking, Skeet. I'll try to help. See you around.}
{131}{999}{现在我们在谈，斯基特。我会尽力帮忙的。回头见。}
### {132}{999}{Won't make any promises, but if I learn something, I'll let you know.}
{132}{999}{不会做出任何承诺，但如果我学到了什么，我会告诉你的。}


### {140}{}{Aren't you tired of being a smart-ass? Think about it - someone set me up bloody well, using vulnerable spots of the warehouse and its security, masterfully fucking up everyone, including me. }
{140}{}{你不厌倦做一个聪明的混蛋吗？想想看――有人利用仓库的薄弱环节和安全设施，巧妙地把包括我在内的所有人都搞砸了。}
### {141}{999}{Okay, I'll go and try to find out something. }
{141}{999}{好吧，我去试着找出一些东西。}
### {142}{999}{Won't make any promises, but if I learn something, I'll let you know.}
{142}{999}{不会做出任何承诺，但如果我学到了什么，我会告诉你的。}


### {100}{}{Hey there. How is it going?}
{100}{}{嘿。过得怎么样？}
### {101}{015}{I came up with some questions about that "elusive thief of canned food".}
{101}{015}{我提出了一些关于那个“难以捉摸的罐头食品窃贼”的问题。}
### {102}{016}{Good. Today you are going to be free of all charges.}
{102}{016}{好的今天你将免费。}
### {103}{017}{Going? Good. Thought of a couple of jokes...}
{103}{017}{离去好的想了几个笑话。。。}
### {104}{999}{Good, Skeet, and I need to go, so - be seeing you! [laugh]}
{104}{999}{很好，斯基特，我得走了，所以――再见！[笑]}


### {150}{}{Which ones?}
{150}{}{哪一个？}
### {151}{018}{Think hard, please: how does this thief manage to get into the warehouse?}
{151}{018}{请仔细想想：这个小偷是怎么进仓库的？}
### {152}{019}{Is there something special I should know while looking for a culprit?}
{152}{019}{在寻找罪犯时，有什么特别的事情我应该知道吗？}
### {153}{999}{No, nothing. I don't really want to know how you lost your teeth. [end the dialogue]}
{153}{999}{不，什么都没有。我真的不想知道你是怎么掉牙的。[结束对话]}


### {160}{}{Wh- WHAT? How?! You are messing with me, man! How is that possible?!}
{160}{}{什么？怎样你在惹我，伙计！这怎么可能？！}
### {161}{020}{Easy - a wild Chimera has been climbing the fence poles, jumping through a hole, and getting into a warehouse. After that, obviously, she had been stealing the cans with food, unpunished. }
{161}{020}{简单――一只野生奇美拉一直在爬篱笆杆，从洞里跳出来，然后进入仓库。显然，在那之后，她一直在偷装有食物的罐头，没有受到惩罚。}


### {170}{}{Spill it.}
{170}{}{撒出去。}
### {171}{021}{Here's one - the man walks around the desert, thirsty. Suddenly, he notices a sign pointing right, saying "water - 3 miles". He gets excited and goes right. Still very thirsty! On hands and knees, he makes it to the next sign, pointing left, saying "water - 2 miles". So, with the last of his strength, he crawls even further, getting to the third sign - it points straight down, saying "water - 1 mile".}
{171}{021}{这是一个――这个男人口渴地在沙漠里走来走去。突然，他注意到一块指示牌指向右边，上面写着“水――3英里”。他很兴奋，然后向右走。还是很渴！他用手和膝盖走向下一个标志，向左指，上面写着“水――2英里”。因此，他用尽最后的力气，爬得更远，到达第三个标志――它指向下方，上面写着“水――1英里”。}
### {172}{022}{For example... Skeet - that's it, behind the bars he sits. Cursing and swearing, not doing shit...}
{172}{022}{例如斯基特――就是这样，他坐在栅栏后面。诅咒和咒骂，不做大便。。。}
### {173}{999}{Nah, forget it. We'll talk later.}
{173}{999}{不，算了。我们稍后再谈。}


### {180}{}{I dunno... You see, the entrance is guarded, and the fence is not of the kind that you can jump over - it's pretty high. This "someone" is really stealthy, like a kid or something... [he flips] Yeah!! It can be a slick kid! Get his ass, you hear me?! Tear his balls off!}
{180}{}{我不知道。。。你看，入口有人把守，栅栏不是那种你可以跳过的――它很高。这个“某人”真的很隐秘，像个孩子什么的。。。[他翻转]是的！！它可能是一个狡猾的孩子！抓住他的屁股，听到了吗？！把他的蛋蛋扯下来！}
### {182}{999}{I got it, Skeet. I'll go try my luck. And you should calm down.}
{182}{999}{我明白了，斯基特。我去碰碰运气。你应该冷静下来。}
### {183}{999}{I see you like kids. I'll go check it out.}
{183}{999}{我看你像个孩子。我去看看。}


### {190}{}{Special? Nah, don't think so. The warehouse is heavily guarded, and to get to the territory unnoticed - that is some fantastic shit. So it's all good: the guards are guarding, the fence is fixed recently...}
{190}{}{特殊的不，别这么认为。仓库戒备森严，而且要在不被注意的情况下进入该地区――这真是太棒了。所以一切都很好：警卫在守卫，围栏最近修好了。。。}
### {191}{023}{Wait. The fence was broken before? For better hearing, I suppose? Tell me details!}
{191}{023}{等待篱笆以前被打破了？我想是为了更好的听力？告诉我细节！}
### {192}{023}{Oh, you fixed the fence, that's solid. So what, helped?}
{192}{023}{哦，你把栅栏修好了，很牢固。那又怎样，帮了忙？}


### {200}{}{[Skeet freezes] Holy shit! What a bitch! Rip them all... To shreds!!}
{200}{}{天哪！真是个婊子！把它们都撕了。。。撕成碎片！！}
### {201}{999}{Okay, lord of shelves, I'll go tell this to Mark.}
{201}{999}{好吧，架子大王，我去告诉马克。}


### {210}{}{I don't get it.}
{210}{}{我不明白。}
### {211}{999}{[Shrug] As you say, Skeet. See you.}
{211}{999}{正如你所说，斯基特。再见}


### {220}{}{Ha-ha. So fucking funny.}
{220}{}{哈哈。太他妈的好笑了。}
### {221}{999}{Haha-ha! There, there. Okay, I need to go, talk later.}
{221}{999}{哈哈哈！那里，那里。好的，我得走了，稍后再谈。}


### {230}{}{What to say? There was a hole once. We fixed it pretty well -  partially covered it with some junk we had, somewhere even put new pieces... Why do you care about the fence? Do you think someone could slip through? Even my dick won't fit in, you know. Maybe only in one place there... So, forget it.}
{230}{}{该怎么说？曾经有一个洞。我们把它修复得很好――用我们有的垃圾部分盖住了它，甚至在某个地方放了新的碎片。。。你为什么关心篱笆？你认为有人会溜过去吗？你知道，连我的老二都穿不进去。也许只有一个地方。。。所以，忘掉它吧。}
### {231}{024}{Skeet, tell me, where is that hole where you put your dick?}
{231}{024}{斯基特，告诉我，你放老二的那个洞在哪里？}
### {232}{024}{Tell me where it is - I want to stick mine too.}
{232}{024}{告诉我它在哪里――我也想留下我的。}


### {240}{}{Look it up, man! Someone like you wouldn't miss it. I mean, someone as naughty... Mwaahaha!}
{240}{}{查一下，伙计！像你这样的人不会错过的。我的意思是，像你这样顽皮的人。。。Mwaahaha！}
### {241}{999}{You are not completely sane, are you, Skeet? [leave in search of a mysterious hole]}
{241}{999}{你还没有完全清醒，是吗，斯基特？[离开寻找一个神秘的洞]}




### {300}{}{[You see a man of shady looks: the left eye is squinted, like he's suspicious of something, some of his front teeth are missing. This guy's soft gaze makes you feel depressed. As you want to leave, he starts to talk] Hey, what are you looking at?! Another one in line to spit into my face?}
{300}{}{[你看到一个脸色阴暗的男人：左眼眯着，好像在怀疑什么，门牙少了一些。这家伙柔和的目光让你感到沮丧。当你想离开时，他开始说话]嘿，你在看什么？！又是一个排队朝我脸上吐口水的人？}

{301}{031}{事实上，我是新市长。}


### {310}{}{You must be shitting me!}
{310}{}{你一定在拉屎我！}
### {311}{032}{I'm here not to convince you, you know.}
{311}{032}{我来这里不是为了说服你，你知道的。}


### {320}{}{Then how about an amnesty for a good old Skeet? I was set up by some scumbag, so I'm sitting here for nothing! }
{320}{}{那赦免一个善良的老斯基特怎么样？我是被某个卑鄙小人陷害的，所以我坐在这里无所事事！}
### {321}{033}{Yeah, sure.}
{321}{033}{是的，当然。}
### {322}{033}{Tell me details. }
{322}{033}{告诉我细节。}


### {330}{}{Man... [he heavily sighs] That's how it is: I'm in charge of the warehouse near the factory, the name is Skeet. The warehouse is full of canned food.

{330}{}{伙计…（他重重地叹了口气）事情就是这样的：我负责工厂附近的仓库，名字叫斯基特。仓库里堆满了罐头食品。[他厉声说道，提高了声音]有人经常撇这些罐头，他做得很好！当然，周围的每个人都认为是我。即使是现在，盗窃仍在继续――但没有人听我的，更不用说有帮助的欲望了。他们说我有同谋。[他有力地吐在地板上]我是无辜的！来真的}

### {331}{034}{Yeah? Isn't the warehouse guarded?}
{331}{034}{是 啊仓库没有人看守吗？}


### {340}{}{It is guarded, alright. To get to the territory unnoticed - that is some fantastic shit. So it's all good: the guards are guarding, the fence is fixed recently...}
{340}{}{有人看守，好吗。在不被注意的情况下进入该地区――这真是太棒了。所以一切都很好：警卫在守卫，围栏最近修好了。。。}

{341}{999}{你不是个讲故事的人吗。坐在你的相机里。你属于这里。}
### {342}{999}{Okay, I'll go look around. Maybe you are innocent.}
{342}{999}{好的，我去四处看看。也许你是无辜的。}
### {343}{035}{The fence was broken before?}
{343}{035}{篱笆以前被打破了？}


### {350}{}{Well, yeah. There was a hole once. We fixed it pretty well - partially covered it with some junk we had, somewhere even put new pieces... Why do you care about the fence? Do you think someone could slip through? I don't think so. There was some hole left, but very small. Even a kid wouldn't fit.}
{350}{}{嗯，是的。曾经有一个洞。我们把它修复得很好――用我们有的垃圾部分盖住了它，甚至在某个地方放了新的碎片。。。你为什么关心篱笆？你认为有人会溜过去吗？我不这么认为。还有一些洞，但很小。即使是孩子也不适合。}
### {351}{036}{Can you tell me where it was?}
{351}{036}{你能告诉我它在哪里吗？}
