### {10}{}{[A skinny man, pale as a ghost and wearing a riveted jacket with lots of patches, is in a heated argument with a tall, red-haired girl. Upon seeing you he quickly pulls out his pistol, almost shooting himself in the leg in the process. Going even more pale, he still manages to points the gun at you with two shacky hands. You notice the blurry letters "FRED" tattoed on the knuckles on both hands.] Stay where you are! What the hell do you want here? How did you find this place?!}
{10}{}{[一个瘦骨嶙峋的男人，脸色苍白，穿着一件有很多补丁的铆钉夹克，与一个高个子红发女孩发生了激烈的争吵。一看到你，他就迅速拔出手枪，差点射中自己的腿。脸色更苍白的是，他仍然用两只颤抖的手把枪对准了你。你注意到双手指节上纹着模糊的字母“FRED”。]呆在原地！你到底想在这里干什么？你是怎么找到这个地方的？！ -- [A skinny man, pale as a ghost and wearing a riveted jacket with lots of patches, is in a heated argument with a tall, red-haired girl.

{110}{}{[他慢慢放下枪，畏缩着，好像在等着被打。女孩看到后做了一个鬼脸。]奇美拉大便。。。我以为是豺狼。尽管如此，仅仅因为你不是他们中的一员，并不意味着你在这里受到欢迎！明白了吗？不管怎样，你想从我们这里得到什么？ -- [He slowly puts the gun down and cringes, as if waiting for a blow.

{130}{}{长袍？是的，我有。从尸体上拿走的。尸体已经完全腐烂，部分被鼹鼠吃掉了，但奇怪的是，长袍丝毫没有受到影响。你为什么问？ -- A robe? Yeah, I have it. Took it from a corpse. The body was completely rotten and partially eaten by molerats, but strangely enough, the robe wasn't affected in the slightest. Why do you ask?}

### {141}{015}{Favor? What favor?}
{141}{015}{赞成帮什么忙？ -- Favor? What favor?}


### {150}{}{[He glances at the girl and lowers his voice] Here's the thing... When we settled here, I laid some mines around the house. You know, against Jackals and such... plus, the Onca Devils often come around. So, uh... [He sniffles embarrassingly] when I was finishing placing the mines, I noticed some Oncas nearby and rushed into the house... to protect my Christie, of course! [Seems like the girl heard him. Giving him a cold look, she kicks an empty can and walks into the farthest corner of the room. Fred sighs.] The thing is, with all this running I forgot where exactly I planted the mines. That's where I need help. Clear us a path through the field, there are only about five mines you would need to dig up.}
{150}{}{[他瞥了一眼女孩，压低了声音]事情是这样的。。。当我们在这里定居时，我在房子周围埋了一些地雷。你知道，反对豺狼之类的。。。此外，昂卡魔鬼经常出现。所以，呃。。。[他尴尬地抽泣]当我布置完地雷时，我注意到附近有一些Oncas，就冲进了房子。。。当然是为了保护我的克里斯蒂！[似乎女孩听到了他的声音。她冷冷地看了他一眼，踢了一个空罐子，走进房间最远的角落。弗雷德叹了口气。]问题是，这么久了，我忘了我到底在哪里埋下了地雷。那就是我需要帮助的地方。给我们扫清一条穿过田野的道路，你只需要挖大约五个地雷。 -- [He glances at the girl and lowers his voice] Here's the thing... When we settled here, I laid some mines around the house. You know, against Jackals and such... plus, the Onca Devils often come around. So, uh...

### {151}{016}{That's it? Why don't you do it yourself then?}
{151}{016}{就这样？那你为什么不自己做呢？ -- That's it? Why don't you do it yourself then?}
### {152}{024}{It is easier for me to kill you off, asshole. And you can't hide from me, I'm not an Onca Devil...}
{152}{024}{我杀了你更容易，混蛋。你不能瞒着我，我不是安大略魔鬼。。。 -- It is easier for me to kill you off, asshole. And you can't hide from me, I'm not an Onca Devil...}
### {153}{999}{I need to think it over... We'll talk later.}
{153}{999}{我需要好好想想。。。我们稍后再谈。 -- I need to think it over... We'll talk later.}


### {160}{}{Yeah, I wanted to, but uh, didn't have the time... There is, uh... so much to do, you know... housekeeping. [The girl chuckles, but then looks at him and just sighs.]}
{160}{}{是的，我想，但是，呃，没有时间。。。有，呃。。。有那么多事情要做，你知道。。。内务管理。[女孩笑了笑，但看着他，只是叹了口气。] -- Yeah, I wanted to, but uh, didn't have the time... There is, uh... so much to do, you know... housekeeping. [The girl chuckles, but then looks at him and just sighs.]}

{161}{999}{好的，我来做。很快回来。希望完好无损。 -- Okay, I'll do it. Be back soon. Hopefully in one piece.}
### {162}{024}{So many problems with you. I'll better do what the Jackals couldn't - paint the walls with your blood.}
{162}{024}{你有很多问题。我最好做豺狼不能做的事――用你的血粉刷墙壁。 -- So many problems with you. I'll better do what the Jackals couldn't - paint the walls with your blood.}
### {163}{017}{Hey, why would you want to miss the chance of showing Christie what you are capable of? You do want her to look at you differently, right? It's not like about killing an Onca with your bare hands - just digging around a bit. Girls like men who are willing to take risks for them, trust my experience.}
{163}{017}{嘿，你为什么要错过向克里斯蒂展示你能力的机会？你确实想让她以不同的眼光看待你，对吧？这不像是徒手杀死一只Onca――只是四处挖掘。女孩喜欢愿意为她们冒险的男人，相信我的经验。 -- Hey, why would you want to miss the chance of showing Christie what you are capable of? You do want her to look at you differently, right? It's not like about killing an Onca with your bare hands - just digging around a bit.

{164}{999}{我明白了。。。我会想办法的，我们再谈。 -- I see... I'll figure something out and we'll talk again.}


### {170}{}{This, uh... Fuck me, maybe you are right. Of course, I can do it... But... Aw man, screw it! I'll do it myself! [He grabs some tool from the table and hastily leaves. You and Christie eagerly listen, expecting the sound of an explosion, but a short while later, you see an even more pale and trembling Fred burst into the room again. Despite that, he has a small unnatural looking smile on his face.]}
{170}{}{这个，呃。。。操我，也许你是对的。当然，我可以…但是。。。天啊，去死吧！我自己做！[他从桌子上抓起一些工具，匆匆离开。你和克里斯蒂急切地听着，期待着爆炸的声音，但过了一会儿，你看到一个更苍白、颤抖的弗雷德再次闯入房间。尽管如此，他脸上还是带着一种不自然的微笑。] -- This, uh... Fuck me, maybe you are right. Of course, I can do it... But... Aw man, screw it! I'll do it myself! [He grabs some tool from the table and hastily leaves. You and Christie eagerly listen, expecting the sound of an explosion, but a short while later, you see an even more pale and trembling Fred burst into the room again.

### {171}{018}{So, how did it go?}
{171}{018}{那么，进展如何？ -- So, how did it go?}


### {180}{}{He sits down, leaning to the wall. His legs are visibly shaking] It's done... damn, I'm so good! [He giggles hysterically] Man, that was... The robe is under the table. Take it, a sign of my gratitude for motivating me to do it. Now Christie is definitely impressed, right?}
{180}{}{他靠在墙上坐下。他的腿明显在发抖]完成了。。。该死，我太棒了！[他歇斯底里地咯咯笑]伙计，那是。。。长袍在桌子下面。拿它来说，这是我对激励我去做这件事的感激之情。现在克里斯蒂肯定印象深刻，对吧？ -- He sits down, leaning to the wall. His legs are visibly shaking] It's done... damn, I'm so good! [He giggles hysterically] Man, that was... The robe is under the table. Take it, a sign of my gratitude for motivating me to do it. Now Christie is definitely impressed, right?}
### {181}{999}{Well, that's your business. I'm going now. Maybe I'll see you around.}
{181}{999}{那是你的事。我现在就走。也许我会在附近见到你。 -- Well, that's your business. I'm going now. Maybe I'll see you around.}
### {182}{999}{Sure! Exactly that. Well, I won't bother you anymore.}
{182}{999}{当然正是这样。好吧，我不会再打扰你了。 -- Sure! Exactly that. Well, I won't bother you anymore.}


### {190}{}{No way! Shit, I was sure that your intestines would be scattered around the wasteland! You did a great job, without a doubt! One moment... [He puts his hand under the table and pulls out a bundle of cloth] Here you go. Looks good, right?}
{190}{}{不可能！妈的，我确信你的肠子会散落在荒原上！毫无疑问，你做得很好！等一下。。。[他把手放在桌子下面，拿出一捆布]给你。看起来不错，对吧？ -- No way! Shit, I was sure that your intestines would be scattered around the wasteland! You did a great job, without a doubt! One moment... [He puts his hand under the table and pulls out a bundle of cloth] Here you go. Looks good, right?}
### {191}{999}{Will do. Okay, I'll go now. See you around, Jackal. I mean, ex-Jackal.}
{191}{999}{好的，我现在就走。再见，豺狼。我是说，前豺狼。 -- Will do. Okay, I'll go now. See you around, Jackal. I mean, ex-Jackal.}

### {200}{}{[He nervously pushes greasy strands of hair from his forehead] What, you don't know? They're the most hardass gang of the whole Radius! And they don't forgive those who betray them. I tossed that all for Christie. [Nods in girl's direction] If you hadn't interrupted us, I would talk her into leaving this place. It's dangerous to stay in one place for too long... [He mumbles] Maybe I'll have to leave on my own in the end...}
{200}{}{[他紧张地推掉额头上油腻的几缕头发]什么，你不知道吗？他们是整个Radius中最顽固的帮派！他们不会原谅那些背叛他们的人。我把这些都投给克里斯蒂了。[朝女孩的方向点头]如果你没有打断我们，我会劝她离开这个地方。在一个地方呆太久是危险的。。。[他喃喃自语]也许我最后不得不自己离开。。。 -- [He nervously pushes greasy strands of hair from his forehead] What, you don't know?

### {203}{999}{That's all I wanted for now.}
{203}{999}{这就是我现在想要的。 -- That's all I wanted for now.}


### {210}{}{How... We ran fast, that's how. [He pauses, looking at his feet] It all started when me and my pack sacked some settlement... raised it to rubble. We disposed of everyone, except the girls... And that's when I saw her. I mean, look at her! I would never have any chance with a girl like this in the Jackals, you know? So I dealt with it my way. I took her and ran off straight here. Me and Ursul stumbled upon this place once, while hunting. It was him who tipped you off, wasn't he? No one else knows... And now we are considering our options about what to do next. That's how it is.}
{210}{}{怎样我们跑得很快，就是这样。[他停顿了一下，看着自己的脚]这一切都始于我和我的团队解除了一些和解。。。把它抬成了瓦砾。我们处理掉了所有人，除了女孩。。。就在那时我看到了她。我的意思是，看看她！我永远不会有机会在豺狼队和这样的女孩在一起，你知道吗？所以我用自己的方式处理它。我带着她直接跑了过来。我和乌苏尔有一次在打猎的时候偶然发现了这个地方。是他向你通风报信的，不是吗？没有人知道。。。现在我们正在考虑下一步该怎么做。事情就是这样。 -- How... We ran fast, that's how. [He pauses, looking at his feet] It all started when me and my pack sacked some settlement... raised it to rubble. We disposed of everyone, except the girls...

### {220}{}{[He takes on a dreamy look, picking his teeth with a finger] I guess... I didn't even know there could be someone like her... Fuck! The rat fur stuck in my teeth again... What I mean is - this is not how I imagined the things to turn out.

{220}{}{[他看起来很梦幻，用手指抠着牙齿]我想。。。我甚至不知道会有像她这样的人。。。操！老鼠皮又卡在我的牙齿里了。。。我的意思是――事情并非如此。如果有人事先告诉我，我会因此与豺狼队发生如此大的问题，我不知道我是否会把她带走。。。[他看着克里斯蒂沉思]但也许这是值得的？ -- [He takes on a dreamy look, picking his teeth with a finger] I guess...
