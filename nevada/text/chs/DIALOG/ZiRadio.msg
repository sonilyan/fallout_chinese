#{213}{}{Well, I'll try.}

#{214}{}{I'll be careful.}

#{216}{}{Are you saying it's safer to be close to civilization?}
{216}{}{你是说接近文明更安全？}
#{217}{}{Heh, you got me. The wastes are hostile and dangerous, even to the wary traveler. Tread with caution, and remember that everything you see and hear is a clue.

#{222}{}{Scared? No, we're not easily scared. We just prefer the freedom of the wilds. We can find everything we need and stay independent. Over.}
{222}{}{害怕的？不，我们不容易害怕。我们只是喜欢野外的自由。我们可以找到我们需要的一切，保持独立。完毕。}
#{223}{}{I don't know. We travel a lot and don't like crowds. If we ever crossed paths, we'd probably keep to ourselves. Nothing personal. Over.}
{223}{}{我不知道。我们经常旅行，不喜欢拥挤。如果我们有过交集，我们可能会保持沉默。没什么私事。完毕。}
#{224}{}{You're that interested? I'm flattered. We're a small group, but we're well trained to live in the wild. Our ancestors lived here when the world burned to ashes and the cities were doing their best to finish off the survivors. "The war was a testament to human greed and stupidity," as our fathers told us. They lived in the wilds and took only what they need, and they passed it on to us. Sometimes we trade for ammunition, but personally, I depend on myself, not some piece of tech. Anything else, over?}
{224}{}{你有兴趣吗？我受宠若惊。我们是一个小团体，但我们受过良好的野外生活训练。当世界被烧成灰烬时，我们的祖先住在这里，城市正在尽最大努力消灭幸存者。”战争证明了人类的贪婪和愚蠢，”正如我们的父亲告诉我们的那样。他们住在荒野里，只拿他们需要的东西，把它传给我们。有时我们用弹药交易，但就我个人而言，我靠的是我自己，而不是某项技术。还有别的事吗？}
#{225}{}{Heh. I'd prefer a strong stout, or perhaps a Nuka-Cola. Be careful out there. Over and out.}
