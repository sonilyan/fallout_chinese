### {251}{}{(incredulously) N-well, yes. And what?}
{251}{}{（难以置信地）嗯，是的。什么？}
### {252}{}{Just clarifying. Can you tell me the latest news?}
{252}{}{只是澄清一下。你能告诉我最新消息吗？}
### {253}{}{Uh, nothing.}
{253}{}{没什么。}
### {254}{}{Yes, there was a golden time when scavengers rummaged through the ruins of Phoenix in droves. Now only really dangerous areas with high radiation remain untouched... And what?}
{254}{}{是的，有一段黄金时期，拾荒者成群结队地在凤凰城的废墟中搜寻。现在只有真正危险的高辐射区域没有受到影响...什么？}
### {255}{}{Tell me about the scavengers.}
{255}{}{告诉我拾荒者的事。}
### {256}{}{You really don't know about us? Hmm, we are really quite inconspicuous.}
{256}{}{你真的不了解我们吗？嗯，我们真的很不起眼。}
### {257}{}{I've been to Garage City, where the scavengers live too.}
{257}{}{我去过车库城，拾荒者也住在那里。}
### {258}{}{Ah, old Kogan must have gone completely crazy, right? Eh, many went there to work when all this hype with the branch rose. I was afraid to go on such a long journey. And now it makes no sense to go - they say the branch is bent.}
{258}{}{啊，老柯干一定是疯了吧？呃，很多人去那里工作的时候，所有这些与分支机构的炒作上升。我害怕走这么长的路。现在走也没有意义了――他们说树枝弯了。}
### {259}{}{So what do you do?}
{259}{}{那你是做什么的？}
### {260}{}{For the first time I hear. What do you do?}
{260}{}{这是我第一次听到。你是做什么的？}
### {261}{}{}
{261}{}{error : string is empty}
### {262}{}{Oh, it's you... uh, scavengers... exactly. Can we talk about something else?}
{262}{}{哦，是你...呃，拾荒者...确切地我们能谈谈别的吗？}
### {263}{}{We look for valuables in the ruins and then sell them to the market or customers. The case is dangerous and difficult. Therefore, for large-scale work, the scavengers united in a whole guild.}
{263}{}{我们在废墟中寻找贵重物品，然后卖给市场或顾客。这个案子既危险又困难。因此，为了进行大规模的工作，拾荒者们联合成了一个完整的公会。}
### {264}{}{Was it such a sought-after job?}
{264}{}{这是一份如此受欢迎的工作吗？}
### {265}{}{Sure. The city grew and demanded more and more things. Now, however, there is not much left in the ruins. In recent years I have been looking mainly for parts from electronics and books for fire worshippers.}
{265}{}{当然城市发展了，对事物的需求也越来越多。然而，现在废墟中已经所剩无几。近年来，我一直在为火灾崇拜者寻找电子产品和书籍中的零件。}
### {266}{}{By the way, can you tell us about the latest news in the city?}
{266}{}{顺便问一下，你能告诉我们这个城市的最新消息吗？}

{273}{}{啊，Vault Tec项目。我遇到了其中一个，26号。}
### {274}{}{Really? And where was it?}
{274}{}{真正地它在哪里？}
### {275}{}{In the western ruins, on the edge of the crater. The Scavengers Guild once made an expedition there, but the Vault was so destroyed that we returned empty-handed.}
{275}{}{在西部的废墟中，在火山口的边缘。拾荒者协会曾经在那里进行过一次探险，但避难所被毁了，我们空手而归。}
### {276}{}{Sorry to hear that. What about other Vaults?}
{276}{}{很抱歉听到这个消息。其他避难所呢？}
### {277}{}{So eager to find the real treasure, huh? Many tried, but found only brain cancer. Or a bandit bullet. If anyone knows about the Vaults, it's probably the fire worshippers. But they are reluctant to share information.}
{277}{}{如此渴望找到真正的宝藏，是吗？许多人尝试过，但只发现了脑癌症。或者土匪子弹。如果有人知道避难所的话，那可能是那些拜火者。但他们不愿分享信息。}
### {278}{}{Thank you, maybe they will help me there.}
{278}{}{谢谢你，也许他们会在那里帮助我。}
### {279}{}{You're no good, you old fart.}
{279}{}{你不好，你这个老混蛋。}

### {290}{}{Can you teach me some tricks?}
{290}{}{你能教我一些技巧吗？}
### {291}{}{I don't want to teach you anything. I don't like you. You walk around the city and run into trouble. Which casador stung you in the ass?}
{291}{}{我什么都不想教你。我不喜欢你。你在城市里走来走去，却遇到了麻烦。哪只卡萨多刺痛了你的屁股？}
### {292}{}{Uh, let's change the subject.}
{292}{}{呃，我们换个话题吧。}
### {293}{}{Then forget it.}
{293}{}{那就忘了。}
### {294}{}{Believe me, this is a dangerous and thankless task.}
{294}{}{相信我，这是一项危险且吃力不讨好的任务。}
### {295}{}{It seems you just don't want to mess with me.}
{295}{}{看来你就是不想惹我。}

### {303}{}{Thanks, Bob. This will help me a lot.}
{303}{}{谢谢你，鲍勃。这对我有很大帮助。}

#Questions - what's new
### {350}{}{Hey, Bob, what's new?}
{350}{}{嘿，鲍勃，有什么新鲜事吗？}
### {351}{}{(squinting) I don't remember getting along so well with you to tell local news.}
{351}{}{（眯着眼睛）我不记得和你相处得这么好，以至于告诉了当地的新闻。}
### {352}{}{Didn't you say you were a scavenger?}
{352}{}{你不是说你是个拾荒者吗？}
### {353}{}{I understand, then let's stop there.}
{353}{}{我明白了，那就到此为止吧。}
### {354}{}{Everything is the same in our ghetto. Gangs, sectarians and poverty.}
{354}{}{我们贫民区的一切都一样。黑帮、宗派主义者和贫困。}
### {355}{}{I see. Let's not talk about the bad.}
{355}{}{我明白了。让我们不要谈论坏的。}
### {356}{}{What kind of gangs are threatening you?}
{356}{}{什么帮派在威胁你？}
### {357}{}{They don't threaten. Own. A gang of Red Cardinals is in control of the entire area. There are a few other small gangs, but they are afraid to come here.}
{357}{}{他们不会威胁。拥有一帮红雀控制着整个地区。还有其他一些小帮派，但他们害怕来这里。}
### {358}{}{What do fire worshippers care about your neighborhood?}
{358}{}{消防崇拜者关心你的社区是什么？}
### {359}{}{And what does the fire worshippers care about your neighborhood?}
{359}{}{火崇拜者关心你的社区是什么？}
### {360}{}{They want to take over the whole city. Slums are just a source of cheap labor for them. All this is covered up by benevolent missions to collect alms to the needy, but we ourselves need more than anyone in the city.}
{360}{}{他们想占领整个城市。贫民窟对他们来说只是廉价劳动力的来源。所有这些都被慈善使命所掩盖，为穷人募捐，但我们自己比城市里的任何人都更需要。}
### {361}{}{Don't you believe them?}
{361}{}{你不相信他们吗？}
### {362}{}{(looks around) Hush! It's better not to ask about sectarians if you don't want problems with them.}
{362}{}{（环顾四周）嘘！如果你不想与宗派主义者发生问题，最好不要问他们。}
### {363}{}{What did you say about gangs that threaten you?}
{363}{}{你对威胁你的帮派说了什么？}
### {364}{}{Is it that serious? I'll take that into account.}
{364}{}{有那么严重吗？我会考虑到的。}
### {365}{}{}
{365}{}{error : string is empty}
### {366}{}{Come on, tell me, it's all yours.}
{366}{}{来吧，告诉我，这都是你的。}
### {367}{}{(shakes his head in anguish) I doubt it very much.}

### {369}{}{Pathetic pussy.}
{369}{}{可怜的小猫。}
### {370}{}{I can stand up for myself. And for you, too. Tell me, what's wrong with these guys?}
{370}{}{我可以为自己挺身而出。对你来说也是如此。告诉我，这些家伙怎么了？}
### {371}{}{Fire worshippers are not what they seem. In the world, they look like good-natured simpletons and talk about the benefits of literacy. But behind the walls of the Cathedral they become silent recluses. What happens at their secret meetings, only they know.}
{371}{}{火崇拜者并不像他们看起来的那样。在这个世界上，他们看起来像脾气好的傻瓜，谈论识字的好处。但在大教堂的墙后，他们成了沉默的隐士。在他们的秘密会议上发生了什么，只有他们自己知道。}
### {372}{}{Go on.}
{372}{}{继续}
### {373}{}{I know that they collect pre-war knowledge and technology. They say that this is how they try to revive the world. But all this is inaccessible to mere mortals. And if we consider that Aaron came to power through revolutions under the banners of the Sacred Fire, it is not difficult to draw some conclusions about their real interests.}
{373}{}{我知道他们收集战前的知识和技术。他们说这就是他们试图复兴世界的方式。但这一切都是凡人无法企及的。如果我们考虑到亚伦是在圣火的旗帜下通过革命上台的，那么就不难对他们的真正利益得出一些结论。}
### {374}{}{Seize control of the city?}
{374}{}{夺取城市的控制权？}
### {375}{}{It was once said that war does not change its goals. It's the same here. Nobody cares about ordinary people. Those who tried to go against the church ended up in hard labor or on a punitive bonfire. And if you join the ranks of Followers, then you can only get out of there feet first.}
{375}{}{曾经有人说，战争不会改变它的目标。这里也是一样。没有人关心普通人。那些试图反对教会的人最终遭到了苦役或惩罚性的篝火。如果你加入了追随者的行列，那么你只能先离开那里。}
### {376}{}{Sounds ominous.}
{376}{}{听起来不祥。}
### {377}{}{And by the way, some have noticed that more people enter the Cathedral than come out. I don't know what this is related to. But there are rumors that the building is actually bigger than it looks, and has a connection to underground utilities. That's how it is. But keep your mouth shut. Some particularly talkative ones went missing.}
{377}{}{顺便说一句，有些人注意到，进入大教堂的人比出来的人多。我不知道这和什么有关。但有传言说，这座建筑实际上比看起来更大，而且与地下公用设施有关。事情就是这样。但要闭上你的嘴。一些特别健谈的人不见了。}
### {378}{}{In that case, we won't bring up this topic anymore.}
{378}{}{那样的话，我们就不再提这个话题了。}
### {379}{}{I don't believe in your stories, garbage man Bob. Bye.}
{379}{}{我不相信你的故事，垃圾人鲍勃。再见}
### {380}{}{They lied that the cathedral was used exclusively for peaceful purposes. But there was a whole bunker with nuclear weapons under the building. And after the explosion, many residents became emboldened and began to talk about how the sectarians intimidated them. Of course, I don't believe them. Nobody believes them now.}
{380}{}{他们谎称大教堂完全用于和平目的。但大楼下面有一整座装有核武器的地堡。爆炸发生后，许多居民变得更加大胆，开始谈论宗派主义者是如何恐吓他们的。当然，我不相信他们。现在没人相信他们。}
### {381}{}{I see. How about a couple more questions?}
{381}{}{我明白了。再来几个问题怎么样？}
### {382}{}{It's a pity you don't know the whole story. Bye, Scavenger Bob.}
{382}{}{很遗憾你不了解整个故事。再见，拾荒者鲍勃。}
