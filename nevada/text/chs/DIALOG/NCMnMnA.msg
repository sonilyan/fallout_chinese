{115}{}{这对夫妇明明知道些什么，却拒绝交谈。}
#{116}{}{This home might not be yours for much longer...}
{116}{}{这个家可能不再是你的了。。。}
#{117}{}{You think we don't know that?! Or do you just have nothing better to do, than antagonize an elderly couple?}
{117}{}{你以为我们不知道？！或者你没有什么比和一对老夫妇作对更好的事了？}

{120}{}{在我为这个城市的人们做了这么多之后，你会认为你需要我的帮助。但如果你坚持。。。}
#{121}{}{Wait, you're him? The hero of the slums? No, please - don't go, I'm sorry. We just wanted to protect our son. Mark screwed up, but he's still family. Wright will throw us to the wolves - we know that. But we've accepted that, if it'll keep Mark safe.}
{121}{}{等等，你是他？贫民窟的英雄？不，请不要走，对不起。我们只是想保护我们的儿子。马克搞砸了，但他还是家人。赖特会把我们丢给狼群的-我们知道。但如果能保证马克的安全，我们已经接受了。}

#{124}{}{Mark came home, told us what happened to his partner and said he wouldn't be able to do Wright's job. What could we do? We gave him all the money and sent him north with a caravan. We don't know where he went - we thought it would be best if no one could find him, not even us. Wherever he is, he can get a second chance there.}
{124}{}{马克回到家，告诉我们他搭档的遭遇，说他不能做赖特的工作。我们能做什么？我们把所有的钱都给了他，然后带着一辆大篷车把他送到了北方。我们不知道他去了哪里-我们想最好是没人能找到他，即使是我们。不管他在哪里，他都有第二次机会。}
#{125}{}{I see. Well, that's all I needed. Goodbye.}
{125}{}{我懂了。好吧，这就是我所需要的。再见。}
#{126}{}{That's all. You can calm down. [leave]}
