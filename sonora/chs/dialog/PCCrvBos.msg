#Questions
### {220}{}{What are you doing?}
{220}{}{你在干什么？}
### {221}{}{I'm getting ready to ship and waiting for the rest of the cargo. My clients don't like to rush, they try to keep detailed records of every damn nut that we have to translate.}
{221}{}{我正准备发货，等待剩下的货物。我的客户不喜欢仓促行事，他们尽量详细记录我们必须翻译的每一个该死的坚果。}
### {222}{}{Have you been doing caravan driving for a long time?}
{222}{}{你开房车很久了吗？}
### {223}{}{Six years or so. I have a flair for the "uranium vein", do you understand? At that time, no one believed that a contract with tinsmiths would become a regular thing. I was lucky to take the vacant seat.}
{223}{}{六年左右。我对“铀矿脉”很有天赋，你明白吗？当时，没有人相信与锡匠签订合同会成为一件常规的事情。我很幸运坐上了空位。}
### {224}{}{What are you transporting?}
{224}{}{你在运输什么？}
### {225}{}{Tinsmiths are primarily interested in uranium ore, provisions and medicines. They exchange them for technology items that they assemble or repair in their workshops.}
{225}{}{锡匠主要对铀矿、食品和药品感兴趣。他们用它们交换技术产品，然后在车间组装或修理。}
### {226}{}{And slaves?}
{226}{}{奴隶呢？}
### {227}{}{Not my profile, slaves are too troublesome. For such a case, they usually organize a special convoy in the mercenary guild or recruit people from the population.}
{227}{}{不是我的个人资料，奴隶太麻烦了。在这种情况下，他们通常会在雇佣军公会中组织一支特殊的车队，或者从人群中招募人员。}
### {228}{}{Who are these tinsmiths?}
{228}{}{这些铁匠是谁？}
### {229}{}{A strange, closed people, obsessed with technology. They have restored ancient machines and are now repairing broken machinery. No one in all of Arizona can match their skills.}
{229}{}{一个奇怪、封闭的人，痴迷于技术。他们修复了古老的机器，现在正在修理损坏的机器。亚利桑那州没有人能与他们的技术相媲美。}
### {230}{}{Where is their settlement?}

### {233}{}{And who are your customers?}

{234}{}{我受雇于火的追随者。问题到此结束。我有一条规则，不要和我遇到的第一个人讨论客户。}

### {240}{}{Damn it! Why did Followers decide to leave this world right now, when business was booming?}
{240}{}{该死！为什么追随者们在生意兴隆的时候决定离开这个世界？}
### {241}{}{Were they that important to your caravan?}
{241}{}{它们对你的商队有那么重要吗？}
### {242}{}{After the Followers, no one will want to do business with me. We only worked with them. Besides, without Followers, the tinsmiths themselves will probably reduce the turnover. Hell, the entire Phoenix economy will come to an end because of some ridiculous explosion. What the hell happened there?}
{242}{}{在追随者之后，没有人愿意和我做生意。我们只和他们一起工作。此外，如果没有追随者，铁匠们自己可能会减少营业额。见鬼，整个凤凰城的经济将因为某种荒谬的爆炸而结束。那里到底发生了什么？}
### {243}{}{How should I know? I generally go about my business. Bye.}
{243}{}{我该怎么知道？我一般都是做我的事。再见}
### {244}{}{I have nothing to do with it! It's definitely not because of me.}
{244}{}{我与此事无关！这绝对不是因为我。}
### {245}{}{Well of course. As if the Followers would let an ordinary peasant into their chambers. Well, well.}
{245}{}{当然。就好像追随者会让一个普通农民进入他们的房间一样。嗯，嗯。}
### {246}{}{Ugh, I thought for a second that you suspected me. It's easier now. Bye-bye.}
{246}{}{啊，我还以为你怀疑我呢。现在比较容易了。再见}
### {247}{}{Do you think they blew themselves up?}
{247}{}{你认为他们自爆了吗？}
### {248}{}{Well, there is such an opinion. They're crazy about all this nuclear technology. Rumor has it that they were assembling a nuclear bomb in the basement of the cathedral. Something went wrong - and here is the result.}
{248}{}{有这样一种观点。他们为所有这些核技术疯狂。有传言说他们正在大教堂的地下室组装核弹。出了问题，结果如下。}
### {249}{}{But why does it bother you so much? Did your caravan depend on the temple?}
{249}{}{但为什么它让你如此烦恼？你的商队依赖于神庙吗？}

### {250}{}{I'm looking for some slaves. They were brought from Flagstaff colony.}
{250}{}{我在找一些奴隶。他们是从弗拉格斯塔夫殖民地带来的。}
### {251}{}{Straight from the colony? Aww... Well, I drive caravans and have nothing to do with slaves. You'd better talk to someone from the city.}
{251}{}{直接从殖民地来的？哇...嗯，我开大篷车，与奴隶无关。你最好和城里的人谈谈。}
### {252}{}{For example? Who is doing this here?}
{252}{}{例如谁在这里做这件事？}
### {253}{}{The mercenary guild will find anyone. It's in the business center, to the left of the city gate.}
{253}{}{雇佣兵公会会会找到任何人。它在商业中心，在城门的左边。}
### {254}{}{You're of no use. Goodbye.}
{254}{}{你没有用。再见}
