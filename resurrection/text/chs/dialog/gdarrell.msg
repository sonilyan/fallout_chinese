#{100}{}{You see a ghoul.}
{100}{}{你看到一个僵尸。}
#{150}{}{You see Darrell.}
{150}{}{你看到达雷尔了。}
#{200}{}{You see a ghoul, he's resting.}
{200}{}{你看到一个僵尸，他在休息。}
#{201}{}{You see a ghoul, he fights as a pro.}
{201}{}{你看到一个僵尸，他是个职业拳击手。}
#{250}{}{You see Darrell, he's obviously bored.}
{250}{}{你看达雷尔，他显然很无聊。}
#{251}{}{You see Darrell. It looks like his recent wounds don't prevent him from fighting.}
{251}{}{你看到达雷尔了。看起来他最近的伤并不能阻止他战斗。}
#{300}{}{You shouldn't be here anymore, seriously.}
{300}{}{你不应该再呆在这里了，说真的。}
#{301}{}{You better leave.}
{301}{}{你最好离开。}
#{302}{}{The doctor wouldn't like to see you here.}
{302}{}{医生不想在这儿见你。}
#{303}{}{I'm not supposed to be disturbed, sorry.}
{303}{}{对不起，我不该被打扰。}
#{304}{}{I'm pleased to get to know you. Take care.}
{304}{}{很高兴认识你。当心。}
#{305}{}{No offense, but you're not supposed to be here.}
{305}{}{无意冒犯，但你不应该在这里。}
#{306}{}{You shouldn't be here anymore, seriously.}
{306}{}{你不应该再呆在这里了，说真的。}
#{500}{}{I'm sorry, but this room will stay occupied for a few more days.}
{500}{}{对不起，这个房间还要住几天。}
#{501}{}{Who are you?}
{501}{}{你是谁？}
#{502}{}{OK, I'll go some place else.}
{502}{}{好吧，我去别的地方。}
#{503}{}{Ugh?}
{503}{}{呃？}
#{550}{}{My name's Darrell. Look, I'd be happy to chat with you, but I'm supposed to stay calm, undisturbed. Doctor's orders.}
{550}{}{我叫达雷尔。听着，我很乐意和你聊天，但我应该保持冷静，不受打扰。医生的命令。}
#{551}{}{What do you do when you're not resting in this room?}
{551}{}{你不在这房间休息的时候怎么办？}
#{600}{}{You never heard anything about me? That's kinda refreshing, you must be new around here. I'm the commander of the most successful task force of the Rebirth. At least they say so.}
{600}{}{你从没听说过我吗？那有点令人耳目一新，你一定是新来的。我是最成功的重生特遣部队的指挥官。至少他们这么说。}
#{601}{}{And what kinds of situations has your unit gone through?}
{601}{}{你的部队经历了什么样的情况？}
#{602}{}{I see. Well, I won't disturb you, if you wish so.}
{602}{}{我懂了。好吧，如果你愿意的话，我不会打扰你的。}
#{650}{}{We participated in almost everything, including hunting for normals and securing pre-war technologies. But for the last few months we've been moving around as close as possible to Albuquerque. We were securing some intel about the city and ambushing small units of Mutant Hunters that moved away too far from the protection of the city. We managed to kill more Hunters than anybody else and that's probably the reason I became somewhat famous around here.}
{650}{}{我们几乎参与了一切，包括寻找正常人和确保战前技术的安全。但在过去的几个月里，我们一直在尽可能靠近阿尔伯克基。我们得到了一些关于这个城市的情报，伏击了一些远离城市保护的变异猎人。我们杀死的猎人比任何人都多，这可能就是我在这里出名的原因。}
#{651}{}{I'm sure you're happy to be so famous.}
{651}{}{我相信你很高兴出名。}
#{652}{}{And what are you doing here now?}
{652}{}{你现在在这里干什么？}
#{700}{}{What of it? I just serve the Rebirth, just like everybody else, doing what I do best. But it looks like it's still not good enough.}
{700}{}{怎么了？我只是为重生服务，就像其他人一样，做我最擅长的事。但看起来还不够好。}
#{701}{}{What do you mean? Does it have something to do with you being here?}
{701}{}{你什么意思？和你在这里有关系吗？}
#{750}{}{I'm recovering from an injury. But I prefer to not to speak about it, try to understand.}
{750}{}{我正在从伤病中恢复。但我宁愿不说，尽量理解。}
#{751}{}{If it's something that troubles you, it will be better if you open up to someone. You'll get it out of your system, you'll be relieved.}
{751}{}{如果有什么事困扰着你，你最好向别人敞开心扉。你会把它从你的系统里弄出来，你会松口气的。}
#{752}{}{Fine. Could you at least tell me what you plan next after you get better?}
{752}{}{好的。你能至少告诉我你好转后的下一步计划吗？}
#{753}{}{I won't disturb you anymore. Bye.}
{753}{}{我不会再打扰你了。再见。}
#{800}{}{Yes, I'm recovering from an injury. But I prefer to not to speak about it, try to understand.}
{800}{}{是的，我正在从伤病中恢复。但我宁愿不说，尽量理解。}
#{801}{}{If it's something that troubles you, it will be better if you open up to someone. You'll get it out of your system, you'll be relieved.}
{801}{}{如果有什么事困扰着你，你最好向别人敞开心扉。你会把它从你的系统里弄出来，你会松口气的。}

#{803}{}{I won't disturb you anymore. Bye.}
{803}{}{我不会再打扰你了。再见。}
#{850}{}{I guess you're right. It's about the last mission. We found a caravan going to Albuquerque and we soon learned that it was full of weapons for the Mutant Hunters. Normally it would be a winner, only if said caravan wasn't guarded by Hunters themselves. Not only were they travelling with the caravan, but one unit that we didn't know about was kept back as a backup, so when we attacked we got ourselves into the crossfire. It was pretty bad, I had to give an order to retreat. Half of my men bit the dust there. We were lucky they didn't pursue us, they would've probably just finished us all off. I guess they didn't want to leave the caravan. I myself got quite a few bullets in me, so many that even the power armor didn't help much.}
{850}{}{我想你是对的。是关于最后一次任务。我们发现一个商队要去阿尔伯克基，很快我们就知道里面装满了变种猎人的武器。通常情况下，它将是一个赢家，只要说，商队没有守卫猎人自己。他们不仅和大篷车一起旅行，还有一支我们不知道的部队作为后援被挡在后面，所以当我们进攻时，我们陷入了交火之中。情况很糟，我不得不下令撤退。我有一半的人在那里咬了灰尘。我们很幸运他们没有追我们，他们可能会把我们都干掉。我猜他们不想离开商队。我自己身上也有不少子弹，太多了，连强力盔甲都帮不上什么忙。}
#{851}{}{Damn.}
{851}{}{该死。}
#{900}{}{Yeah, exactly. If only I held on with the attack, and did proper recon, we could've noticed that Hunter backup unit. But I was in a hurry, I was worried that the caravan would get too close to the city, where there could be more Hunters. My men paid for it and I got a couple reminders for that stupidity.}
{900}{}{是的，没错。如果我能控制住进攻，进行适当的侦察，我们就能发现猎人的后备部队。但是我很匆忙，我担心车队会离城市太近，那里可能会有更多的猎人。我的人为此付出了代价，我收到了一些提醒。}
#{901}{}{Will you be all right?}
{901}{}{你没事吧？}
#{950}{}{I'm healthy, ready to get back to combat. Even my power armor is allegedly repaired. But the doctor insists that I should rest for a couple more days. So I stay here until she gives me permission to go.}
{950}{}{我很健康，准备好战斗了。就连我的能量护甲也被修复了。但是医生坚持要我多休息几天。所以我留在这里直到她允许我离开。}
#{951}{}{And what then?}
{951}{}{然后呢？}
#{952}{}{I see, I won't disturb you anymore.}
{952}{}{我明白了，我不会再打扰你了。}
#{1000}{}{I want to start to hunt the Thirteenth with my unit, nobody managed to catch him, and now he's too big of a threat for us to let it stay that way. I asked for this mission before, but Tramell wouldn't pull us out because we know the lands around Albuquerque well and we'd been successful there. Now I'll be able to make up for my mistake, in case we're successful.}
{1000}{}{我想和我的部队一起去追捕第十三个，没人能抓住他，现在他对我们的威胁太大了，我们不能让它这样下去。我以前要求过这个任务，但特拉梅尔不肯把我们拉出来，因为我们对阿尔伯克基周围的土地很熟悉，而且我们在那里也很成功。现在我可以弥补我的错误，以防我们成功。}
#{1001}{}{What makes him so dangerous? He's alone, what can he do?}
{1001}{}{是什么让他这么危险？他一个人，他能做什么？}
#{1002}{}{I see.}
{1002}{}{我懂了。}
#{1050}{}{He knows everything about the Rebirth. It would be enough if he tells what he knows to someone who hates us, let's say the Hunters, in the worst case. Not only would they go after us more fanatically and would recruit even more people knowing about the machine, but they could learn from him the location of this complex, which we managed to keep secret so far. We just can't let him be, we need to get him.}
{1050}{}{他对重生了如指掌。在最坏的情况下，如果他把他所知道的告诉一个恨我们的人，比如说那些猎人，那就足够了。他们不仅会更加狂热地追击我们，招募更多了解机器的人，而且他们可以从他那里了解到这个建筑群的位置，到目前为止，我们一直设法保守这个秘密。我们不能让他这样，我们要抓住他。}
#{1051}{}{I see, I get it now.}
{1051}{}{我明白了，我现在明白了。}
#{1100}{}{I want to start to hunt the Thirteenth with my unit, nobody managed to catch him, and now he's too big of a threat for us to let it stay that way.

#{1102}{}{I see.}

#{1150}{}{No offense, it was nice talking to you, but you should really go now. If the doctor sees you here, we'll both be in trouble.}
{1150}{}{无意冒犯，很高兴和你谈话，但你现在真的应该走了。如果医生在这儿见你，我们都会有麻烦的。}
#{1151}{}{Why are you here and not in the infirmary?}
{1151}{}{你为什么在这里而不在医务室？}
#{1152}{}{OK, take care.}
{1152}{}{好的，保重。}
#{1200}{}{The infirmary is crowded and I don't need constant medical care anymore. I'm practically healthy, well at least according to my opinion. But I'm not a doctor, so it's not my decision to make.}
{1200}{}{医务室很拥挤，我再也不需要经常看病了。我实际上很健康，至少在我看来是这样。但我不是医生，所以这不是我的决定。}
#{1201}{}{I see, take care then.}
{1201}{}{我明白了，那就保重。}
#{1250}{}{Hold on now. I'm happy to be able to talk with someone, I'm bored to death here.}
{1250}{}{等等。我很高兴能和别人交谈，我在这里烦死了。}
#{1251}{}{Tell me then, what kinds of situations has your unit gone through.}
{1251}{}{那么告诉我，你的部队经历了什么样的情况。}
#{1252}{}{No no. I won't violate the doctor's orders. Goodbye.}
{1252}{}{不，不，我不会违反医生的命令。再见。}
#{1300}{}{Even if the doctor would think otherwise, you don't disturb me at all.}
{1300}{}{即使医生不这么想，你也不要打扰我。}
#{1301}{}{What is that you don't want to talk about? If it's something that troubles you, it will be better if you open up to someone. You'll get it out of your system, you'll be relieved.}
{1301}{}{你不想谈的是什么？如果有什么事困扰着你，你最好向别人敞开心扉。你会把它从你的系统里弄出来，你会松口气的。}
#{1302}{}{OK. Would you tell me what you plan next after you get better?}
{1302}{}{好 啊。你能告诉我你康复后的下一步计划吗？}
#{1303}{}{I won't contradict the doctor. Goodbye.}
{1303}{}{我不会反驳医生。再见。}
#{1350}{}{That's a pity, I really like talking to you. But if you wish so.}
{1350}{}{真遗憾，我真的很喜欢和你说话。但如果你愿意的话。}
#{1351}{}{What do you plan next after the doctor releases you?}
{1351}{}{医生让你出院后，你下一步打算做什么？}
