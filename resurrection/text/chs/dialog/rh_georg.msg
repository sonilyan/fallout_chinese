{603}{}{等待！你需要多少钱？}
#{650}{}{At least 15 ca... [He starts coughing.] 15 caps. Or twenty... please.}
{650}{}{至少15个。。。[他开始咳嗽]15杯。或者二十。。。拜托。}
#{651}{}{I don't have 15 caps on me!}
{651}{}{我身上没有15个瓶盖！}
#{652}{}{OK, I can give you fifteen. Hopefully it'll help you a bit. How long have you been begging?}
{652}{}{好的，我可以给你15英镑。希望对你有点帮助。你乞讨多久了？}
#{653}{}{Maybe tomorrow. I can't spare that much money right now.}
{653}{}{也许明天吧。我现在不能拿出那么多钱。}
#{654}{}{Fine, there you go - another 15 caps.}

#{751}{}{How long have you been living like this?}
{751}{}{你这样生活多久了？}
#{752}{}{Did you really use to be the mayor?}
{752}{}{你以前真的当过市长吗？}

{802}{}{那样的话，再见。我有更好的事情要做。}
#{850}{}{Well... Years ago... it was still busy in here! Business was flourishing, all of Kirtland grew... I used to be the mayor here... [He pauses for a long time.] Yes... believe it or not... I used to be the mayor! And then... those two came!}
{850}{}{好。。。几年前。。。这里仍然很忙！生意兴隆，整个国家都在发展。。。我曾经是这里的市长。。。[他停顿了很长时间]是的。。。信不信由你。。。我以前是市长！然后。。。那两个来了！}
#{851}{}{Who?}

#{900}{}{Julian and... Leonard. Those two... used to be friends... but then something happened that shouldn't have come about... Their love for Maria... destroyed everything.}
{900}{}{朱利安和。。。伦纳德。那两个。。。以前是朋友。。。但后来发生了不该发生的事。。。他们对玛丽亚的爱。。。毁掉了一切。}
#{901}{}{They both loved the same woman?}
{901}{}{他们都爱同一个女人？}
#{902}{}{Who was that Maria person?}
{902}{}{那个叫玛丽亚的人是谁？}
#{903}{}{That sounds like a long story.}
{903}{}{听起来说来话长。}
#{950}{}{Yes... they both fell in love... and that was... the end of the town.}
{950}{}{对。。。他们都坠入爱河。。。那是。。。小镇的尽头。}
#{951}{}{Who was this Maria person?}
{951}{}{这个叫玛丽亚的人是谁？}
#{1000}{}{Maria was... my only daughter. She was so beautiful.}
{1000}{}{玛丽亚。。。我唯一的女儿。她真漂亮。}
#{1001}{}{And who did she pick?}
{1001}{}{她选了谁？}
#{1002}{}{She was? What's up with her now?}
{1002}{}{她是？她现在怎么了？}
#{1003}{}{Dumb tale, I'm out.}
{1003}{}{愚蠢的故事，我出局了。}
#{1100}{}{If you don't want to listen, then go.}
{1100}{}{如果你不想听，那就去吧。}
#{1101}{}{Of course I'm going.}
{1101}{}{我当然要去。}
#{1102}{}{No, wait! I want to hear the story. What happened next?}
{1102}{}{不，等等！我想听这个故事。接下来发生了什么？}
#{1150}{}{She... I have no idea... she didn't even know herself.}
{1150}{}{她。。。我不知道。。。她甚至不了解自己。}
#{1151}{}{So what happened to her?}
{1151}{}{她怎么了？}
#{1200}{}{She died... nobody knows why. [He pauses for a long time.] They found her stabbed to death... and Julian... and Leonard... they both say... the other killed her... because she didn't chose him.}
{1200}{}{她死了。。。没人知道为什么。[他停顿了很久]他们发现她被刺死了。。。朱利安。。。莱纳德。。。他们都说。。。另一个杀了她。。。因为她没有选择他。}
#{1201}{}{So that's why they are in war with each other?}
{1201}{}{这就是为什么他们要打仗？}
#{1202}{}{Has anybody tried to clarify the murder?}
{1202}{}{有人试图澄清谋杀案吗？}
#{1250}{}{Exactly... friendship turned into... hate and the town died with Maria.}
{1250}{}{确切地。。。友谊变成了。。。仇恨和城市与玛丽亚一起死去。}
#{1251}{}{Has anybody tried to clarify the murder?}
{1251}{}{有人试图澄清谋杀案吗？}
#{1300}{}{No... that's the... [He coughs.] the only reason I'm staying here... I want to know the truth... before I die...}
{1300}{}{不。。。这就是。。。[他咳嗽]我留在这里的唯一原因。。。我想知道真相。。。在我死之前。。。}

{1301}{}{准备死了吗？}
#{1350}{}{I'm ill. [He coughs.] I'm dying more every day.}
{1350}{}{我病了。[他咳嗽]我一天比一天要死。}
#{1351}{}{It rips my heart out, but I can't do anything for you. Farewell.}
{1351}{}{它撕裂了我的心，但我不能为你做任何事。再会。}
#{1352}{}{I'm sorry to hear that. I want to help you somehow!}
{1352}{}{听到这个消息我很难过。我想帮助你！}
#{1400}{}{You can't save me. The only thing I want is... to find the real... murderer!}
{1400}{}{你救不了我。我唯一想要的是。。。找到真正的。。。凶手！}
#{1401}{}{Okay, I'll get on it right away. I'll be back when I've found something.}
{1401}{}{好的，我马上去。我找到东西就回来。}
#{1402}{}{I'll help you, but first, I need to know more so I know where to start.}
{1402}{}{我会帮你的，但首先，我需要知道更多，这样我才知道从哪里开始。}
#{1403}{}{OK, I'll look into it, maybe. Farewell.}
{1403}{}{好吧，也许我会调查一下。再会。}
#{1404}{}{I'll see what I can do. But for now I want to know something else.}
{1404}{}{我看看我能做什么。但现在我想知道别的。}
#{1450}{}{It's been going on for a few years. [He coughs.] Since it's started... Julian and Leonard... managed to destroy it here.}
{1450}{}{已经有几年了。[他咳嗽]自从开始。。。朱利安和伦纳德。。。设法把它毁了。}
#{1451}{}{Why, what happened between them?}
{1451}{}{为什么，他们之间发生了什么？}
#{1452}{}{Yep, I know that story. Tell me something else.}
{1452}{}{是的，我知道那个故事。告诉我别的。}
#{1500}{}{Yes... this town used to be mine... until those two came and destroyed it.}
{1500}{}{对。。。这个小镇曾经是我的。。。直到那两个人来摧毁它。}
#{1501}{}{Who?}
{1501}{}{谁？}
#{1502}{}{Yep, I know that story. Tell me something else.}
{1502}{}{是的，我知道那个故事。告诉我别的。}
#{1550}{}{This used to be... a fine town. Back then... it was called... Kirtland. A lot of caravans used to come and stop by... the town lived and I... liked it here. Nowadays... nobody has a reason to come here... This town is... dead.}
{1550}{}{这曾经是。。。一个好城市。那时候。。。它被称为。。。科特兰。以前有很多商队来过。。。镇上住着我。。。喜欢这里。现在。。。没有人有理由来这里。。。这个小镇。。。死了。}
#{1551}{}{It can't be that bad. I think.}
{1551}{}{不会那么糟的。我想。}
#{1650}{}{Do you want to hear the whole story?}
{1650}{}{你想听整个故事吗？}
#{1651}{}{Yes, do tell, please.}
{1651}{}{是的，请告诉我。}
#{1652}{}{Nope. Tell me about something else.}
{1652}{}{不。跟我说说别的。}
#{1700}{}{Trust me... It won't be the same here ever again.}
{1700}{}{相信我。。。这里再也不一样了。}
#{1701}{}{What happened here, actually?}
{1701}{}{实际上，这里发生了什么？}
#{1702}{}{I understand. Tell me about something else.}
{1702}{}{我理解。跟我说说别的。}
#{1750}{}{Do you want to hear the whole story?}
{1750}{}{你想听整个故事吗？}
#{1751}{}{Yes, do tell, please.}
{1751}{}{是的，请告诉我。}
#{1752}{}{No, I think I actually know it already. Bye.}
{1752}{}{不，我想我已经知道了。再见。}
#{1850}{}{Ah... it's you. Anything new about Maria?}
{1850}{}{啊。。。是你。玛丽亚有什么新情况吗？}
#{1851}{}{Farley told me that Maria's funeral had been arranged by doctor Reed.}
{1851}{}{法利告诉我玛丽亚的葬礼是里德医生安排的。}
#{1852}{}{Some bits. Doctor Reed apparently found out who killed Maria, but before she could tell anyone, they probably killed her too. Sadly, rats gnawed on her notes a lot, so we won't learn anything new from them. [Hand him the notes.]}
{1852}{}{一些碎片。里德医生显然知道是谁杀了玛丽亚，但在她告诉任何人之前，他们可能也杀了她。可悲的是，老鼠经常啃她的笔记，所以我们不会从它们身上学到什么新东西。[把纸条递给他。]}
#{1853}{}{I know a bit more. Maria was already dead when they stabbed her. Someone had poisoned her beforehand. Doctor Reed was buried in her grave too.}
{1853}{}{我知道的多一点。他们刺伤玛丽亚时，她已经死了。有人事先给她下毒了。里德医生也葬在她的坟墓里。}
#{1854}{}{Nothing extra. I'll come back when I find out more.}
{1854}{}{没什么特别的。等我知道更多的时候再回来。}
#{1855}{}{I do what I can, but I need something to start with. Do you remember anything that could help?}
{1855}{}{我尽我所能，但我需要一些开始。你还记得有什么能帮上忙的吗？}
#{1900}{}{What? She was poisoned? That's terrible! And where is... Maria's grave?}
{1900}{}{什么？她中毒了？太可怕了！那在哪里。。。玛丽亚的坟墓？}
#{1901}{}{Hold on, you don't know?}
{1901}{}{等等，你不知道？}
#{1950}{}{No, sadly not. Nobody's ever told me about it and I can't just go and search for it.}
{1950}{}{不，遗憾的是没有。从来没有人告诉过我这件事，我不能就这么去找。}
#{1951}{}{As far as I know, graves are usually located in a graveyard. Why didn't you go and look there?}
{1951}{}{据我所知，坟墓通常位于墓地。你为什么不去那里看看？}
#{2000}{}{I wanted to... but I can't... [He gargles.] Leonard's men... almost killed me last time. I had no chance to find the grave... or to ask the gravedigger, who supposedly lives there still.}
{2000}{}{我想。。。但我不能。。。[他漱口]伦纳德的人。。。上次差点杀了我。我没有机会找到坟墓。。。或者去问掘墓人，他应该还住在那里。}
#{2001}{}{Leonard's men?}
{2001}{}{伦纳德的人？}
#{2002}{}{That sucks, old man. I'll be back once I know more.}
{2002}{}{糟透了，老头子。等我知道更多我会回来的。}
#{2050}{}{Someone wanted to... kill me... Then I found out they... were Leonard's.}
{2050}{}{有人想。。。杀了我。。。后来我发现他们。。。是伦纳德的。}
#{2051}{}{Oh yes, they don't like people from the South.}
{2051}{}{哦，是的，他们不喜欢南方人。}
#{2052}{}{That's odd. It seems strange to me. Leonard shouldn't have anything against you.}
{2052}{}{真奇怪。我觉得很奇怪。莱纳德不应该对你有任何不满。}
#{2100}{}{Yeah... they don't. This entire town is filled with hatred.}
{2100}{}{是 啊。。。他们没有。整个小镇充满了仇恨。}
#{2101}{}{I noticed that too. I'm off to investigate more.}
{2101}{}{我也注意到了。我要去调查更多。}
#{2102}{}{That's odd. It seems strange to me. Leonard shouldn't have anything against you.}
{2102}{}{真奇怪。我觉得很奇怪。莱纳德不应该对你有任何不满。}
#{2150}{}{That's... an important clue. Moreover, I don't remember pissing Leonard off... more than Julian... And he lets... me live peacefully.}
{2150}{}{那是。。。一条重要线索。而且，我不记得惹莱纳德生气了。。。不仅仅是朱利安。。。他让。。。我过着平静的生活。}
#{2151}{}{Hm, I'll focus on Leonard. Take care.}
{2151}{}{嗯，我会关注伦纳德。当心。}
#{2152}{}{Maybe Leonard fears you could discover something. Maybe he's the murderer. I'll look into it.}
{2152}{}{也许伦纳德担心你会发现什么。也许他就是凶手。我会调查的。}
#{2250}{}{Wait a sec! Something crossed my mind!}
{2250}{}{等等！我突然想起了什么！}
#{2251}{}{What is it?}
{2251}{}{这是怎么一回事？}
#{2252}{}{No time. Bye.}
{2252}{}{没时间了。再见。}
#{2300}{}{See, that's strange I didn't realize it sooner, but now... if Maria was poisoned, then Leonard must be the murderer. Only he can brew poisons here.}
{2300}{}{看，真奇怪，我没早点意识到，但现在。。。如果玛丽亚中了毒，那么伦纳德一定是凶手。只有他才能在这里酿造毒药。}
#{2301}{}{What? Are you sure?}
{2301}{}{什么？你确定吗？}
#{2350}{}{For sure... but then again, that helper of his... Alexa could know something about poisons too.}
{2350}{}{当然。。。但话说回来，他的助手。。。Alexa也可能知道毒药。}
#{2351}{}{Hmm, she could.}
{2351}{}{嗯，她可以。}
#{2400}{}{Damn! We're so close! I have to know it! [He coughs.] I need to know who the murderer is!}
{2400}{}{该死！我们太近了！我必须知道！[他咳嗽]我要知道凶手是谁！}
#{2401}{}{Now that I think of it, could Alexa have been jealous of Maria? That woman the gravedigger mentioned doesn't fit in the story if we assume Leonard did it. Also, that note you received had to be written by the murderer. I doubt Leonard could've kept his calm and covered up everything so quickly back then.}
{2401}{}{现在我想起来了，亚历克斯会嫉妒玛丽亚吗？如果我们假设是伦纳德干的，那么掘墓人提到的那个女人就不适合这个故事。而且，你收到的那张纸条一定是凶手写的。我怀疑伦纳德当时是否能保持冷静，如此迅速地掩盖一切。}
#{2402}{}{No doubt about that, I just need to check up on something.}
{2402}{}{毫无疑问，我只是需要检查一下。}
#{2450}{}{Yes! Damn! Why didn't my old fart brain think of it sooner! It could be Alexa as well!}
{2450}{}{对！该死！为什么我的老屁脑没早点想到呢！也可能是Alexa！}
#{2451}{}{It has to be her, everything points at her. I think I'll pay her a visit.}
{2451}{}{一定是她，一切都指向她。我想我要去看望她。}
#{2452}{}{That's one possibility. I'll look into it.}
{2452}{}{这是一种可能性。我会调查的。}
#{2453}{}{In that case Maria's murderer is dead already.}
{2453}{}{那样的话，谋杀玛丽亚的凶手已经死了。}
#{2500}{}{Go, go and find the truth... [He coughs.] Please.}
{2500}{}{去，去找出真相。。。[他咳嗽]拜托。}
#{2501}{}{I'll be back again.}
{2501}{}{我会再回来的。}
#{2550}{}{Anything new?}
{2550}{}{有什么新的吗？}
#{2551}{}{Nothing, actually.}
{2551}{}{其实没什么。}
#{2552}{}{You can live in peace. Maria's murderer is dead!}
{2552}{}{你可以平静地生活。谋杀玛丽亚的凶手死了！}
#{2600}{}{What? Was it... Alexa? What... what happened?}
{2600}{}{什么？是不是。。。亚历克斯？什么。。。发生什么事了？}
#{2601}{}{Yes, it was all Alexa's work. She poisoned Maria and then killed Leonard too. Supposedly because she loved him but he didn't love her back. Leonard has been dead for quite some time and Alexa led his gang in his name.}
{2601}{}{是的，这都是Alexa的工作。她毒死了玛丽亚，然后又杀了伦纳德。应该是因为她爱他，但他不爱她。伦纳德已经死了很长一段时间了，亚历克斯以他的名义领导了他的帮派。}
#{2602}{}{Everything fits. Alexa poisoned Maria, maybe so she could get rid of Leonard more easily. Nobody has seen him for years, so he could've been dead for a long time. The rumor that he's afraid for his life just cleared the way for Alexa to be in charge instead of him.}
{2602}{}{一切都合适。亚历克斯毒死了玛丽亚，也许这样她就能更容易地摆脱伦纳德。很多年没人见过他了，所以他可能已经死了很长时间了。有传言说他害怕自己的生命，这为亚历克萨代替他来负责扫清了道路。}
#{2650}{}{That treacherous bitch! Did you... kill her?}
{2650}{}{那个奸诈的婊子！你有没有。。。杀了她？}
#{2651}{}{That treacherous bitch! Did you... kill her?}
{2651}{}{那个奸诈的婊子！你有没有。。。杀了她？}
#{2652}{}{Yes, I avenged your daughter's death. Justice was served.}
{2652}{}{是的，我为你女儿的死报仇了。正义得到伸张。}
#{2653}{}{Yes, I avenged your daughter's death. Justice was served.}
{2653}{}{是的，我为你女儿的死报仇了。正义得到伸张。}
#{2654}{}{She's dead. She killed herself. Maybe the last bit of her conscience kicked in and she couldn't bear her guilt. Justice was served.}
{2654}{}{她死了。她自杀了。也许她良心的最后一点受到了伤害，她无法忍受自己的罪恶感。正义得到伸张。}
#{2700}{}{Thank you. I hope dogs tear her disgusting body apart! A thousandfold thanks! Finally I can spend the rest of my life with peace in my soul... [He wheezes and slowly heads to the graveyard.]}
{2700}{}{非常感谢。我希望狗能把她恶心的身体撕碎！万分感谢！最后我可以在我的灵魂里平静地度过我的余生。。。[他气喘吁吁地慢慢走向墓地。]}
#{2701}{}{Time to move on.}
{2701}{}{是时候继续了。}
#{2750}{}{I hope even death didn't bring her redemption, and dogs... will tear her body apart. You have my thanks. Sadly, I have nothing to give you... in return for all your help. Finally I can spend the rest of my life with peace in my soul... [He wheezes and slowly heads to the graveyard.]}
{2750}{}{我希望即使是死亡也不会给她带来救赎，还有狗。。。会把她的身体撕裂。谢谢你。可悲的是，我没有什么可以给你。。。作为对你所有帮助的回报。最后我可以在我的灵魂里平静地度过我的余生。。。[他气喘吁吁地慢慢走向墓地。]}
#{2751}{}{Time to move on.}
{2751}{}{是时候继续了。}
#{2800}{}{Ah... [He coughs.] So many people around and all I get is such an idiot... You won't help me...}
{2800}{}{啊。。。[他咳嗽]这么多人在我身边，而我得到的只是一个白痴。。。你不会帮我的。。。}
#{2801}{}{Help? Heeeeelp! Heeeeeeeeeelp!}
{2801}{}{救命啊？嘿，帮帮我！嘿，嘿！}
#{2850}{}{Money! Cash! I need cash, get it?}
{2850}{}{钱！现金！我需要现金，明白吗？}
#{2851}{}{Monies? Mooonieeees... Clink Clank... Give! Give!}
{2851}{}{钱？Mooonieeees。。。叮当当当。。。给我！给我！}
#{2900}{}{Thanks, that's noble of you. Sadly, I don't know much myself... Back then, they just called me to the alley where it had happened. When I saw her lying there, I couldn't make another step. My legs weakened and they had to carry me away. It hurt me a lot. I have no idea how it went afterwards. I was angry with the whole world and I wanted to be as far away as possible from everyone, so nobody told me anything. Just Farley brought me a note from doctor Reed that the funeral was taken care of.}
{2900}{}{谢谢，你真好。可悲的是，我自己知道的不多。。。那时候，他们只是把我叫到发生这件事的巷子里。当我看到她躺在那里，我再也走不动了。我的腿虚弱了，他们不得不把我抬走。我很伤心。我不知道后来怎么样了。我对整个世界都很生气，我想尽可能远离所有人，所以没有人告诉我任何事情。法利给我带来了里德医生的一张纸条，说葬礼已经办妥了。}
#{2901}{}{Who is doctor Reed?}
{2901}{}{里德医生是谁？}
#{2950}{}{She used to work at the clinic here... She left the town shortly after the murder and she did the right thing. There would be nothing good in store for her.}
{2950}{}{她以前在这里的诊所工作。。。她在谋杀案发生后不久就离开了小镇，她做了正确的事。对她来说，没有什么好东西在等着她。}
#{2951}{}{Where exactly did the murder happen?}
{2951}{}{谋杀案到底发生在哪里？}
#{3000}{}{North Side... and doesn't matter where exactly. From what I've heard the place... lies in ruins, so you won't find the exact spot.}
{3000}{}{北边。。。不管具体在哪里。据我所知。。。在废墟中，所以你找不到确切的地点。}
#{3002}{}{Okay, thanks for the info. I'll see what I can figure out.}
{3002}{}{好的，谢谢你的消息。我看看我能想出什么办法。}
#{3050}{}{Wait! That's completely different handwriting! The note from Farley... wasn't written this neatly! You have to trust me. I've read it so many times I can recall every single detail of it. Doctor Reed couldn't have written the one I saw before.}
{3050}{}{等待！那是完全不同的笔迹！法利的字条。。。写得不整齐！你必须相信我。我读了很多遍，我能回忆起它的每一个细节。里德医生不可能写我以前看到的那本。}
#{3051}{}{But that means whoever wrote that note is obviously the murderer!}
{3051}{}{但这意味着写那张纸条的人显然就是凶手！}
#{3052}{}{What does it mean?}
{3052}{}{这是什么意思？}
#{3053}{}{What? What note from Farley?}
{3053}{}{什么？法利的什么字条？}
#{3100}{}{That means... the one who wrote that very note... probably killed Maria! You have to find him!}
{3100}{}{这意味着。。。写下那张字条的人。。。可能杀了玛丽亚！你必须找到他！}
#{3101}{}{Alright, I'll continue the investigation.}
{3101}{}{好吧，我继续调查。}
#{3150}{}{Yes! You have to find him... I hope for some progress.}
{3150}{}{对！你必须找到他。。。我希望取得一些进展。}
#{3151}{}{Don't worry, I'm on it.}
{3151}{}{别担心，我会的。}
#{3200}{}{Yes, that's true. I didn't partake in the funeral preparations. The last time I saw Maria was in the alley she died in. When I saw her lying there, I couldn't make another step. My legs weakened and they had to carry me away. It hurt me a lot. I have no idea how it went afterwards. I was angry with the whole world and I wanted to be as far away as possible from everyone, so nobody told me anything. Just Farley brought me a note from doctor Reed that the funeral was taken care of.}
{3200}{}{是的，没错。我没有参加葬礼的准备工作。我最后一次见到玛丽亚是在她死的巷子里。当我看到她躺在那里，我再也走不动了。我的腿虚弱了，他们不得不把我抬走。我很伤心。我不知道后来怎么样了。我对整个世界都很生气，我想尽可能远离所有人，所以没有人告诉我任何事情。法利给我带来了里德医生的一张纸条，说葬礼已经办妥了。}

#{3202}{}{Alright, I'll try to figure out more.}
{3202}{}{好吧，我会想办法的。}
#{3205}{}{Ah. Doctor Reed is an interesting person by all means. She apparently figured out who the murderer was, but before she could speak up, they probably killed her too. Sadly, rats gnawed on her notes a lot, so we won't learn anything new from them. [Hand him the notes.]}
{3205}{}{啊。里德医生是个很有趣的人。她显然知道凶手是谁，但在她开口之前，他们可能也杀了她。可悲的是，老鼠经常啃她的笔记，所以我们不会从它们身上学到什么新东西。[把纸条递给他。]}
#{3250}{}{When I saw Maria stabbed to death in that alley, I broke down. I was terribly angry and I wanted to be as far away from everyone as possible. I didn't partake in preparations nor the funeral itself. Just Farley brought me a note saying everything had gone well undersigned by doctor Reed. But now I see she couldn't have written it.}
{3250}{}{当我看到玛丽亚在那条巷子里被刺死时，我崩溃了。我非常生气，我想尽可能远离所有人。我既没有参加准备工作，也没有参加葬礼本身。法利给我带来了一张纸条，上面写着一切都很顺利，里德医生在下面签了字。但现在我知道她不可能写了。}
#{3251}{}{I see! But that means whoever wrote the note you've talked about is obviously the murderer!}
{3251}{}{我懂了！但这意味着写你提到的纸条的人显然就是凶手！}
#{3252}{}{What does it mean then?}
{3252}{}{那是什么意思？}
