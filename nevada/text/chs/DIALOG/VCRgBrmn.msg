#{112}{}{Okay.}
{112}{}{可以。}
#{113}{}{That??s enough. If you're going to vomit - do it outside. Okay?}

#{116}{}{Have you heard, slavers are no more?}
{116}{}{你听说了吗，奴隶主已经不在了？}
#{117}{}{Yes, I heard it. I can't even imagine, who could have done that. But I'm more worried about what will happen to the ring now. I suppose, the owner will continue business, but there won't be any slaves fighting, only free fighters. Which is not bad, honestly speaking.}
{117}{}{是的，我听到了。我甚至无法想象，谁会这么做。但我更担心戒指现在会怎么样。我想，主人会继续做生意，但不会有奴隶打仗，只有自由战士。老实说，这还不错。}
