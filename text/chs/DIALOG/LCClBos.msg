#{100}{}{You see Principal Skinner.}
{100}{}{你看斯金纳校长。}
#{101}{}{You see the managing director of the Nuka-Cola factory. He's got his business face on.}
{101}{}{你看到努卡可乐厂的总经理了。他有生意上的面子。}
#{110}{}{Good day. What is your business here?}
{110}{}{很好的一天。你在这里干什么？}
#{111}{}{Sorry to bother you.}
{111}{}{很抱歉打扰你。}
#{112}{}{Anything else?}
{112}{}{还有别的吗？}
#{120}{}{I've heard your Nuka-Cola vending machines are constantly being robbed. Have you managed to catch the thief yet?}
{120}{}{我听说你们的努卡可乐自动售货机经常被抢。你抓到小偷了吗？}
#{121}{}{No! That's some elusive operator. Sheriff Burton's been running off his feet. The only thing we know is *how* he performs his robberies. Sadly, we have been unable to come up with a good means of security yet. I'm afraid that eventually we'll have to resort to the hands-on sales practice and stop using vending machines. Our products will become more expensive. Alas. If you see anything suspicious, please report it to the Sheriff. We must catch the robber at all costs!}
{121}{}{不！那是个难以捉摸的操作员。伯顿警长一直在逃跑。我们只知道他是怎么抢劫的。可悲的是，我们还不能想出一个好的安全措施。恐怕最终我们将不得不采取实际操作的销售方式，停止使用自动售货机。我们的产品会变得更贵。唉。如果你发现任何可疑的东西，请向警长报告。我们必须不惜一切代价抓住那个强盗！}
#{122}{}{I confess, It is me who's been robbing you. Now I feel bad about it.}
{122}{}{我承认，是我抢了你的钱。现在我感到很难过。}
#{123}{}{That's a pity, err... I hope you'll find the perpetrator.}
{123}{}{真遗憾，呃。。。我希望你能找到凶手。}
#{124}{}{Come on! Don't make me laugh! It was probably some juvie from Salt Lake's outskirts or those bastards from Provo.}
{124}{}{加油！别逗我笑！可能是盐湖城郊区的某个犹太教徒或者普罗沃的那些混蛋。}
#{125}{}{Provo?}
{125}{}{普罗沃？}
#{126}{}{Oh... My, my...}
{126}{}{哦。。。我的，我的。。。}
#{127}{}{Yes, I am more inclined to think it was them. Don't you know? It's a settlement to the south of here, homing criminals that were exiled out of the city by Burton. Now they hate the whole of Salt Lake for that. They once were the kings of the city's underworld, having free rein over whom to destroy and whom to spare. Fortunately, that time is in the past now. You'd better stay away from the area, just like we do.}
{127}{}{是的，我更倾向于认为是他们。你不知道吗？这是一个在这里南部的定居点，安置被伯顿流放出城的罪犯。现在他们恨整个盐湖城。他们曾是城内阴间的君王，可以随意支配谁毁灭谁饶恕。幸运的是，这段时间已经过去了。你最好离这地方远点，就像我们一样。}
#{128}{}{Got it.}
{128}{}{知道了。}
#{140}{}{I managed to find the part which is needed to start the artesian tower.}
{140}{}{我设法找到了启动自流塔所需的部件。}
#{141}{}{My God! You don't say! Is that really so?! And it works?}
{141}{}{天哪！你不要说！真的是这样吗？！它能用吗？}
#{142}{}{I'm not completely sure, but it looks well-fitting.}
{142}{}{我不太确定，但看起来很合适。}
#{143}{}{You know, I won't be asking any questions! I've been trying to find the part for several years! Please, sell it to me!}
{143}{}{你知道，我不会问任何问题的！几年来我一直在找这个角色！拜托，卖给我吧！}
#{144}{}{Why should I sell it to you, exactly? From what I gather, the citizens also need water...}
{144}{}{我到底为什么要卖给你？据我所知，市民们也需要水。。。}
#{145}{}{It's in everyone's interest that the tower works properly. Water is the basis of life... And of our production. The cleaner it is - the bigger our income, and the more grateful clients we have. The factory will attracts rows of caravans to Salt Lake! It will cause a real uproar!}
{145}{}{这座塔运转正常符合每个人的利益。水是生命的基础。。。以及我们的产品。越干净，我们的收入就越高，我们的客户也就越感激。这家工厂将吸引成排的商队来盐湖城！会引起轩然大波的！}
#{146}{}{Is that all?}
{146}{}{就这些吗？}
#{147}{}{I would also like to note that our factory is the wealthiest enterprise in the city. No one will be able to offer you more for this thing than us. Do you understand?}
{147}{}{我还要指出的是，我们工厂是本市最富有的企业。没有人能比我们提供更多的东西给你。你明白吗？}
#{148}{}{I do. How much do you offer?}
{148}{}{我愿意。你们的报价是多少？}
#{149}{}{20,000 bucks. That is all we can allow right now. Keep in mind that our accounts are in the constant state of flux, the profits fluctuate, so tomorrow the price I mentioned may be different.}
{149}{}{20000美元。这就是我们现在所能允许的。请记住，我们的帐户是在不断变化的状态，利润波动，所以明天我提到的价格可能会有所不同。}
#{150}{}{I agree. Here's the part.}
{150}{}{我同意。这是部分。}
#{151}{}{No, I'd rather look for other buyers.}
{151}{}{不，我宁愿找其他买家。}
#{152}{}{Oh... Well then. I'm one hundred percent sure you'll come back though, because *nobody* in the city can offer you more money. Trust me on that.}
{152}{}{哦。。。那好吧。我百分之百肯定你会回来的，因为城里没人能给你更多的钱。相信我。}
#{153}{}{We'll see...}
{153}{}{我们拭目以待。。。}
#{154}{}{You have delivered the water filter for the use in the artesian tower and with that improved the quality of life in the area.}
{154}{}{您已经交付了水过滤器用于自流塔，并用它改善了该地区的生活质量。}
#{155}{}{[The factory manager is fixated on the part, ignoring your presence.]}
{155}{}{[工厂经理盯着零件，无视你的存在。]}
#{156}{}{Goodbye.}
{156}{}{再见。}
#{157}{}{[You drop the part on the floor, making the factory manager's hair stand on end.] WHAT ARE YOU DOING!!!}
{157}{}{[你把零件掉在地上，把厂长的头发竖起来]你在干什么！！！}
#{158}{}{Oh, don't worry, it's alright. Let me pick this back up...}
{158}{}{别担心，没事的。让我把这个拿回来。。。}
#{160}{}{Lately, I wandered into the artesian tower... Why don't you get it working?}
{160}{}{最近，我走进了自流塔。。。你为什么不让它工作呢？}
#{161}{}{Yeah, I know. The whole city's been talking about it for ages. But alas, so far the talks remained just that - talks.}
{161}{}{是的，我知道。整个城市都在谈论这个问题很久了。但遗憾的是，到目前为止，谈判仍然是那种――谈判。}
#{162}{}{What's the trouble?}
{162}{}{有什么问题吗？}
#{163}{}{We have no filter to clean the water and remove impurities like sand and pebble. If we start the turbines without the thing, they will be rendered inoperable in a matter of hours.}
{163}{}{我们没有过滤器来净化水，去除沙子和卵石等杂质。如果我们在没有这个东西的情况下启动涡轮机，它们将在几个小时内无法运行。}
#{164}{}{Is that filter so hard to find?}
{164}{}{那个过滤器很难找到吗？}
#{165}{}{You bet! There aren't many cities in the region that possess artesian towers of such size. We've tried to send caravans to so many places! Nobody could find the parts needed, not in New Reno, not in Denver, not even in Vegas - the city that is so huge and has lots of much cleaner water - not even there could we find the filter. We've lost all hope.}
{165}{}{当然！这个地区没有多少城市拥有这么大的自流塔。我们已经试着派大篷车去很多地方了！没有人能找到需要的零件，不在新雷诺，不在丹佛，甚至不在维加斯-这个城市是如此巨大，有很多更干净的水-甚至在那里我们也找不到过滤器。我们失去了所有的希望。}
#{166}{}{Can't this filter be replaced by something else?}
{166}{}{这个过滤器不能换成别的吗？}
#{167}{}{I'm afraid it can't. No equivalent parts in the region.}
{167}{}{恐怕不行。这个地区没有同等的零件。}
#{168}{}{Well, too bad. It would be nice to find the part...}
{168}{}{好吧，太糟糕了。很高兴能找到那个角色。。。}
#{169}{}{}
{169}{}{}
#{170}{}{What will be the next task?}
{170}{}{下一个任务是什么？}
#{171}{}{I'm afraid, you'll have to go on a business trip. That is, if you want to make some money, of course.}
{171}{}{恐怕你得出差了。当然，如果你想赚钱的话。}
#{172}{}{Please, tell me more.}
{172}{}{请告诉我更多。}
#{173}{}{Not interested.}
{173}{}{不感兴趣。}
#{174}{}{If we want our enterprise to be efficient, we'll have to set up some automation again. The main problem right now is the programmable logic controller. The rest our technicians can handle, but I don't think I've ever seen a single programmer here in Salt Lake. You'll have to find a specialist like that in another city and get that thing working again. This is a very important task. Do you think you'll be able to do it?}
{174}{}{如果我们想让我们的企业有效率，我们就得重新建立一些自动化系统。现在的主要问题是可编程逻辑控制器。剩下的我们的技术人员可以处理，但我想我从来没有在盐湖城见过一个程序员。你得在另一个城市找一个这样的专家，让它重新工作。这是一项非常重要的任务。你认为你能做到吗？}
#{175}{}{I'll do it.}
{175}{}{我会的。}
#{176}{}{Then please go visit our chief technician, he's in the nearby building. He'll give you all the details. I will cover your expenses after the job is done. Oh, and here's a ticket for a stagecoach. You may find it useful.}
{176}{}{那请去拜访我们的首席技术员，他就在附近的大楼里。他会告诉你所有的细节。工作完成后我会支付你的费用。哦，这是一张驿站马车的票。你会发现它很有用。}
#{177}{}{Okay.}
{177}{}{可以。}
#{178}{}{The job is done. Here's a working controller.}
{178}{}{工作完成了。这是一个工作控制器。}
#{179}{}{It pleases me greatly when everything works as intended! You have my thanks. Here's your payment: }
{179}{}{当一切如期进行时，我非常高兴！谢谢你。这是您的付款：}
#{180}{}{. Pleasure working with you.}
{180}{}{. 很高兴和你一起工作。}
#{181}{}{Goodbye.}
{181}{}{再见。}
#{200}{}{Are you the director here?}
{200}{}{你是这里的主任吗？}
#{201}{}{Could you tell me about the factory?}
{201}{}{你能告诉我工厂的情况吗？}
#{202}{}{How's business at the factory?}
{202}{}{工厂生意怎么样？}
#{203}{}{That's right. My name is Skinner. Principal Skinner.}
{203}{}{这是正确的。我叫斯金纳。斯金纳校长。}
#{204}{}{How did you obtain your position?}
{204}{}{你是怎么得到这个职位的？}
#{205}{}{I'm a hereditary owner of the enterprise.}
{205}{}{我是这家企业的世袭所有者。}
#{206}{}{Really?! No mob wars, no dumping dead bodies of competitors, blackmailing or intimidating, nothing?}
{206}{}{真正地？！没有暴民战争，没有丢弃竞争对手的尸体，没有勒索或恐吓，什么都没有？}
#{207}{}{Hmm... Are you from Reno, perchance? They seem to like to deal with problems by smashing them with big sticks there. Here, everyone knows that no wannabe would be able to head an enterprise: they won't have the knowledge, nor the skills, nor the support of the community.}
{207}{}{隐马尔可夫模型。。。你是雷诺人吗？他们似乎喜欢在那里用大棒砸问题。在这里，每个人都知道，没有人能领导一个企业：他们没有知识，没有技能，也没有社区的支持。}
#{208}{}{I see. May I ask another question?}
{208}{}{我懂了。我可以再问一个问题吗？}
#{209}{}{Okay, that's enough.}
{209}{}{好了，够了。}
#{210}{}{As far as I'm concerned, that's impossible - I think you've walked over many dead bodies to reach your goals.}
{210}{}{就我而言，这是不可能的-我想你已经走过了许多尸体来达到你的目标。}
#{211}{}{My ancestor was the owner of the factory before the war, but they were making quite different drinks here back then. Ten years ago, I started to actively work on re-establishing the factory: I found Nuka-Cola recipes and gathered necessary people, while the laborers were provided by the local forced-labor camp. Repairing old machinery was a much harder task, though. We spent many years to get it all to work.}
{211}{}{我的祖先在战前是这家工厂的老板，但那时他们在这里生产完全不同的饮料。十年前，我开始积极重建工厂：我找到了努卡可乐的配方，并召集了必要的人员，而劳动力则由当地的强迫劳动营提供。不过，修理旧机器是一项困难得多的任务。我们花了很多年的时间使这一切得以实现。}
#{212}{}{What is this nonsense?! Well... We did have forced laborers working for us, that is true. Those were some hard times, indeed.}
{212}{}{这是什么废话？！好。。。我们确实强迫劳工为我们工作，这是真的。那确实是一些艰难的时期。}
#{213}{}{The factory hasn't been doing well lately. Production has been declining, our income is low and people lose motivation to work.}
{213}{}{这家工厂最近经营不好。生产一直在下降，我们的收入很低，人们失去了工作的动力。}
#{214}{}{The factory has been doing rather well lately. We have so many contracts now that we sometimes run short of hands able to work on them! Our income is high and people are as motivated as ever. We must strike it while it's hot and get the most out of the situation.}
{214}{}{这家工厂最近经营得相当好。我们现在的合同太多了，有时人手不够！我们的收入很高，人们的积极性一如既往。我们必须趁热打铁，充分利用形势。}
#{215}{}{Everything as usual: the people are lazy, the income isn't encouraging, but we have enough to keep our heads above water for now... Not sure how long we'll last, though.}
{215}{}{一切如常：人民懒惰，收入不令人鼓舞，但我们现在有足够的钱保持头脑清醒。。。不过，不知道我们还能坚持多久。}
#{216}{}{Some asshole has also sabotaged our production. We haven't been able to find out who it was. It must have been some tricky son of a bitch!}
{216}{}{一些混蛋也破坏了我们的生产。我们还没找到是谁。一定是个狡猾的混蛋！}
#{217}{}{Oh, and some bastard has been robbing our Nuka-Cola vending machines. That sly punk leaves no evidence behind and acts very carefully. I've already talked to the Sheriff regarding this matter. I'm sure mr. Burton will promptly deal with the problem.}
{217}{}{哦，还有个混蛋抢了我们的努卡可乐自动售货机。那个狡猾的朋克没有留下任何证据，行动非常谨慎。关于这件事我已经和警长谈过了。我相信伯顿先生会及时处理这个问题。}
#{218}{}{I see.}
{218}{}{我懂了。}
#{219}{}{Where do you get ingredients for production?}
{219}{}{你们从哪里得到生产原料？}
#{220}{}{There are several Mormon farms located in the Salt Lake City area. They grow all the necessary plants there. Salt and alkali are extracted from the Great Salt Lake's deposits. So we had no problems with that.}
{220}{}{盐湖城地区有几个摩门教农场。他们在那里种所有必要的植物。盐和碱是从大盐湖的沉积物中提取出来的。所以我们没有问题。}
#{230}{}{What will be the next task?}
{230}{}{下一个任务是什么？}
#{231}{}{There's one caravaner out there who wants to take advantage of our troubles. We had a deal that he would find a new encoder for us to replace the broken one. We agreed on the price of $300. Now that he has the encoder, he asks for $1,000!}
{231}{}{有一个商队想利用我们的麻烦。我们说好了，他会给我们找一个新的编码器来替换坏的。我们商定了300美元的价格。既然他有了编码器，就要价1000美元！}
#{232}{}{[More.]}
{232}{}{[更多信息。]}
#{233}{}{That caravaner has a lot of nerve! Each day he raises the price even more, and we have no hope of buying it from another seller. The Sheriff decided to stay away from this conflict of interest of ours. Therefore, I'm offering you a deal: you get the encoder from him using *any* means that you may deem necessary, and I'll buy it from you for a reasonable price of $300. This way we'll resolve several issues at once: I'll get the part for a fair price, you'll make some money, and the caravaner will get what he deserves for his greediness.}
{233}{}{那个大篷车很有胆量！他每天都把价格提高得更高，我们再也没有希望从别的卖家那里买了。警长决定远离我们的利益冲突。因此，我给你一个交易：你用你认为必要的任何方法从他那里得到编码器，我以300美元的合理价格从你那里买下来。这样我们就可以同时解决几个问题：我会以公平的价格得到零件，你会赚些钱，商队的贪婪会得到他应得的。}
#{234}{}{Sound good. Where do I find the caravaner?}
{234}{}{听起来不错。我在哪能找到商队？}
#{235}{}{This crooked stuff is not for me. Sorry.}
{235}{}{这个歪东西不适合我。对不起的。}
#{236}{}{Great. The caravaner is lodging at The 6'th Bullet.}
{236}{}{伟大的。商队在6号弹头处住宿。}
#{237}{}{Got it.}
{237}{}{知道了。}
#{238}{}{I have the encoder.}
{238}{}{我有编码器。}
#{239}{}{Great. Just like we agreed - here is your $300.}
{239}{}{伟大的。就像我们说好的-这是你的300美元。}
#{240}{}{Piece of cake. Do you have other tasks?}
{240}{}{小菜一碟。你还有其他任务吗？}
#{241}{}{Thank you, but our cooperation will have to be put on hold. I'll come back when I'm ready to continue.}
{241}{}{谢谢，但我们的合作将不得不暂停。我准备好了再回来。}
#{250}{}{I'm looking for work. Maybe you can find a position for me?}
{250}{}{我在找工作。也许你能帮我找个职位？}
#{251}{}{I have enough workers for now... On second thought, are you from around here?}
{251}{}{我现在有足够的工人。。。仔细想想，你是这附近的人吗？}
#{252}{}{Oh, no, I'm just passing through.}
{252}{}{哦，不，我只是路过。}
#{253}{}{Passing through, you say? Then I may have something for you. You could do me a few favors then be on your way.}
{253}{}{你说是路过？那我可以给你点东西。你可以帮我几个忙然后就上路了。}
#{254}{}{Sounds good. What kind of favors are we talking here?}
{254}{}{听起来不错。我们在这里谈什么好处？}
#{255}{}{Recently, some shady type has shown up in the business center. He dares to sell Nuka-Cola in this city, even though he has nothing to do with my factory. We have enough problems as it is, and he's just making things worse. If you rid the city of him, I'll pay you 300 bucks.}
{255}{}{最近，一些阴暗的类型出现在商业中心。他敢在这个城市卖努卡可乐，尽管他和我的工厂无关。我们现在的问题已经够多了，他只是让事情变得更糟。如果你把他赶走，我就付给你300美元。}
#{256}{}{Let me ask you something first.}
{256}{}{我先问你件事。}
#{257}{}{Rid the city of the shady Nuka-Cola salesman? I'll do it.}
{257}{}{除掉这个城市的阴暗的努卡可乐推销员？我会的。}
#{258}{}{You know, I don't think it's fair to do business like that. I refuse.}
{258}{}{你知道，我觉得这样做不公平。我拒绝。}
#{259}{}{Hmm... Make sure to shut the door on your way out.}
{259}{}{隐马尔可夫模型。。。出去的时候一定要把门关上。}
#{260}{}{Er, okay.}
{260}{}{呃，好吧。}
#{261}{}{Thank you for your time. But please remember: I'm not asking you to do anything illegal, but I don't care how you deal with the guy. In any case, I will deny my involvement in any misconduct, and the Sheriff trusts me much more than he trusts you.}
{261}{}{谢谢你抽出时间。但请记住：我不是要你做任何违法的事，但我不在乎你怎么处理这个家伙。无论如何，我会否认我参与了任何不当行为，警长对我的信任远远超过对你的信任。}
#{262}{}{I'll keep in mind your... Loyalty. The job's as good as done.}
{262}{}{我会记住你的。。。忠诚。工作做得很好。}
#{263}{}{Certainly. What would you like to know?}
{263}{}{当然。你想知道什么？}
#{264}{}{Where do I find this salesman?}
{264}{}{我在哪里能找到这个推销员？}
#{265}{}{How does a small retail outlet like that affects your enterprise?}
{265}{}{像这样的小零售店对你的企业有什么影响？}
#{266}{}{Is it your Nuka-Cola that the salesman trades?}
{266}{}{售货员交易的是你的努卡可乐吗？}
#{267}{}{Why not ask the police for help?}
{267}{}{为什么不向警察求助呢？}
#{268}{}{I see. I have other questions.}
{268}{}{我懂了。我还有其他问题。}
#{269}{}{As I told you: at the caravan camp.}
{269}{}{就像我告诉你的：在大篷车营地。}
#{270}{}{You think it's a "small retail outlet". But think about it, how can a random flashman have so many goods to sell? I don't know where he gets his Nuka-Cola, but it certainly doesn't come from us. Nobody knows how he got so many bottles for his stock. He may even have a full storage somewhere. What's worse is that his goods also cost less. Such competition may negatively affect the factory's reputation in the future.}
{270}{}{你认为这是个“小零售店”。但想想看，一个随机抽认的人怎么会有这么多商品要卖呢？我不知道他从哪儿弄来的努卡可乐，但肯定不是我们的。没人知道他怎么会有这么多瓶存货。他甚至可能有一个完整的存储在某处。更糟糕的是，他的商品也便宜。这种竞争可能会对工厂未来的声誉产生负面影响。}
#{271}{}{No, his stock does not come from our storages. We have already checked. It looks like he managed to stumble upon a pre-war Nuka-Cola cache. Some abandoned truck or a big warehouse, I don't know.}
{271}{}{不，他的货不是从我们的仓库来的。我们已经查过了。看来他设法找到了战前的努卡可乐储藏室。一些废弃的卡车或者一个大仓库，我不知道。}
#{272}{}{I've already talked to the Sheriff about it. He doesn't see anything criminal in the salesman's activities. Thus, legally, his business is clean.}
{272}{}{我已经和警长谈过了。他不认为推销员的活动有什么犯罪行为。因此，从法律上讲，他的生意是清白的。}
#{273}{}{Thanks for your answers.}
{273}{}{谢谢你的回答。}
#{274}{}{I have some questions about the job.}
{274}{}{我对这份工作有些疑问。}
#{275}{}{About that "shady" salesman.}
{275}{}{关于那个“阴暗”的推销员。}
#{276}{}{Yes?}
{276}{}{对？}
#{277}{}{The salesman won't be troubling this city anymore. Ever. He had a certain... "Accident" happen to him.}
{277}{}{推销员不会再给这个城市添麻烦了。永远不会。他有某种“意外”发生在他身上。}
#{278}{}{The salesman is left without his goods, so he now has nothing to sell.}
{278}{}{那个推销员没有货，所以他现在没有东西可卖。}
#{279}{}{The salesman handed in his goods and was hired to work for you by your manager upon my recommendation.}
{279}{}{那个推销员交了货，经我推荐，被你们经理雇来为你们工作。}
#{280}{}{Very good. It's good to see something done in a proper manner.}
{280}{}{非常好。很高兴看到事情以适当的方式进行。}
#{281}{}{Thanks.}
{281}{}{谢谢。}
#{282}{}{May I ask you a question? Why does you Nuka-Cola tastes different from the one sold by that salesman?}
{282}{}{我可以问你一个问题吗？为什么你的努卡可乐和那个售货员卖的不一样？}
#{283}{}{[He frowns, showing his discontent with this conversation.] Firstly, the pre-war drink has been kept in closed bottles for more than 70 years. In that time, like wine, it has changed its properties, gaining new ones. The Nuka-Cola that you can find in pre-war stocks is already quite different than it once was. And secondly... I don't like to talk about it, but we don't know how the drink was made in the past. We managed to attain a more-or-less similar tasting qualities, thanks to the information from the labels and our own laboratory research. Of course, it's not a complete match. That's why our Nuka-Cola is somewhat different from the pre-war one, but people still like it.}
{283}{}{[他皱着眉头，表示他对这次谈话的不满]首先，战前的饮料已经被关在瓶子里70多年了。在那个时代，它和葡萄酒一样，改变了它的特性，获得了新的特性。你可以在战前的库存中找到的努卡可乐已经和以前大不相同了。其次。。。我不想谈这个，但我们不知道这饮料过去是怎么做的。多亏了标签上的信息和我们自己的实验室研究，我们设法获得了或多或少相似的品尝品质。当然，这不完全匹配。这就是为什么我们的努卡可乐与战前的有所不同，但人们仍然喜欢它。}
#{284}{}{Thanks for your answer. Now the things are much clearer.}
{284}{}{谢谢你的回答。现在情况更清楚了。}
#{1120}{}{I've heard your Nuka-Cola vending machines are constantly being robbed. Have you managed to catch the thief yet?}
{1120}{}{我听说你们的努卡可乐自动售货机经常被抢。你抓到小偷了吗？}
#{1122}{}{I confess, It is me who's been robbing you. Now I feel bad about it.}
{1122}{}{我承认，是我抢了你的钱。现在我感到很难过。}
#{1150}{}{I agree. Here's the part.}
{1150}{}{我同意。这是部分。}
#{1160}{}{I once wandered into the artesian tower... Why don't you get it working?}
{1160}{}{有一次我走进了自流塔。。。你为什么不让它工作呢？}
#{1251}{}{I have enough workers for now... On second thought, are you from around here?}
{1251}{}{我现在有足够的工人。。。仔细想想，你是这附近的人吗？}
