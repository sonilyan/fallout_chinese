### {10}{}{Hello.}
{10}{}{你好}
### {11}{031}{Hello. [You have trouble noticing the man before you. All your thoughts are about the incredibly delicious smell of meat, which is all around the tent. Your mouth is filled with saliva.]}
{11}{031}{你好[你很难注意到你面前的男人。你所有的想法都是关于帐篷周围令人难以置信的美味的肉味。你的嘴里充满了唾液。]}
### {12}{002}{Hello. Do you live here?}
{12}{002}{你好你住在这里吗？}
### {13}{031}{What is it that smells so good in here?}
{13}{031}{是什么东西闻起来这么香？}

{14}{045}{那么，你就是赛斯最讨厌的厨师？}
### {15}{999}{Sorry, wrong tent.}

### {21}{003}{, I'm an ex-worker from Olympus tower.}
{21}{003}{，我是奥林巴斯大厦的前工人。}

{23}{005}{是的，很好。}


### {30}{}{Pleasure to meet you, }
{30}{}{很高兴见到你，}

### {51}{039}{I'd like to know something.}
{51}{039}{我想知道一些事情。}
### {52}{999}{Thanks. See you!}
{52}{999}{谢谢再见}


### {60}{}{I don't talk to almost anyone... We used to live together with my brother. Though we didn't have any visitors back then too, it wasn't so lonely with the two of us together.}
{60}{}{我几乎不和任何人说话。。。我们曾经和我哥哥住在一起。虽然当时我们也没有访客，但我们两个在一起并不那么孤独。}
### {61}{007}{Where is your brother now?}
{61}{007}{你哥哥现在在哪里？}
### {62}{039}{Don't be depressing. I'd like to know something else.}
{62}{039}{不要沮丧。我想知道其他的事情。}
### {63}{999}{Talk later.}
{63}{999}{稍后再谈。}


### {70}{}{He lives in a nearby tent.}
{70}{}{他住在附近的一个帐篷里。}
### {71}{008}{Why don't you live together?}
{71}{008}{你们为什么不住在一起？}
### {72}{017}{So, Seth is your brother?}

### {82}{}{[Matt suddenly gets furious] Because I hate him!!}
{82}{}{[马特突然大发雷霆]因为我恨他！！}
### {80}{009}{Why?}
{80}{009}{为什么？}
### {81}{}{Let's talk about something else.}
{81}{}{让我们谈谈其他事情。}


### {90}{}{Seth despises everyone, caring only about himself. I have been tolerating him all of my life, until one day I got fed up and decided to end this. Now I live separately and don't want to know anything about him.}
{90}{}{赛斯鄙视所有人，只关心自己。我一辈子都在容忍他，直到有一天我受够了，决定结束这一切。现在我分开住了，不想知道任何关于他的事情。}
### {91}{013}{I'm glad you've found a way out of it.}
{91}{013}{我很高兴你找到了摆脱困境的方法。}
### {92}{011}{What did he do to you?}
{92}{011}{他对你做了什么？}


### {110}{}{It's more about what he didn't do. Seth never acted like a brother, never complimented me on anything. Not one time. Never gave me support when I really needed it. All he could do is to demand listening to him and do what he says. When I tried to talk to him about what I want to do in life, he just made fun of me, telling me I won't be able to accomplish anything. So, that was the end for us.}
{110}{}{更多的是关于他没有做什么。赛斯从来没有表现得像个兄弟，从来没有在任何事情上称赞过我。一次也没有。当我真正需要的时候，他从来没有给过我支持。他所能做的就是要求听他的话，照他的话做。当我试图和他谈谈我想在生活中做什么时，他只是取笑我，告诉我我什么都做不了。所以，这就是我们的结局。}
### {111}{012}{Maybe that was his way of taking care of you. To keep you out of trouble.}
{111}{012}{也许那是他照顾你的方式。让你远离麻烦。}
### {112}{014}{Looks like he failed as a brother. But does it mean you have to be angry at him?}
{112}{014}{看起来他作为兄弟失败了。但这是否意味着你必须对他生气？}
### {113}{015}{You're being a real jerk. Set was wrong only in one thing - not beating you up enough.}
{113}{015}{你真是个混蛋。Set只在一件事上错了――打你还不够。}


### {120}{}{That's bullshit! He tried to make me look like a wimp, unable to live without him. He just wanted to feel his superiority. But what did he actually achieve in life? So much ambition with no results. A king of his tent. A president of a toilet.}
{120}{}{那是胡说八道！他试图让我看起来像个窝囊废，没有他就活不下去。他只是想感受一下自己的优越感。但他在生活中到底取得了什么成就？野心太大却没有结果。他帐篷里的国王。厕所的总裁。}
### {121}{014}{Looks like he failed as a brother. But does it mean you have to be angry at him?}
{121}{014}{看起来他作为兄弟失败了。但这是否意味着你必须对他生气？}
### {122}{015}{You're being a real jerk. Set was wrong only in one thing - not beating you up enough.}
{122}{015}{你真是个混蛋。Set只在一件事上错了――打你还不够。}


### {131}{}{Yeah, well, that's all in the past now. I can finally leave this behind.}
{131}{}{是的，好吧，这都是过去的事了。我终于可以把这件事抛在脑后了。}
### {132}{039}{Let's talk about something else.}
{132}{039}{让我们谈谈其他事情。}
### {133}{999}{See you.}
{133}{999}{再见}


### {140}{}{Sometimes I try to forgive him because I understand how he feels. After our parents died, we were captured by the slavers and sold to the Sunset Jackals. This was hell, especially for Seth. Every new day was making him angrier for everything he had to endure. So, that was our childhood. Then the camp we were held in was destroyed by some warriors wearing strange shiny suits of armor. But Seth was already full of hate by that point, so, I guess now he wants to have revenge on the world, or something similar.}
{140}{}{有时我试图原谅他，因为我理解他的感受。父母死后，我们被奴隶贩子抓走，卖给了日落豺狼。这真是地狱，尤其是对赛斯来说。每一个新的日子都让他对所要忍受的一切更加愤怒。那就是我们的童年。然后，我们被关押的营地被一些穿着奇怪闪亮盔甲的战士摧毁了。但赛斯那时已经充满了仇恨，所以，我想现在他想报复这个世界，或者类似的事情。}
### {141}{021}{Have you tried to talk to him about this?}
{141}{021}{你有没有试着和他谈谈这件事？}
### {142}{999}{Sad story. I need to go.}
{142}{999}{悲伤的故事。我得走了。}


### {150}{}{You two are really the same kind. Good luck to both of you.}
{150}{}{你们两个真的是同类。祝你们俩好运。}
### {151}{999}{And to you too.}
{151}{999}{对你也是如此。}


### {160}{}{Good for you. Seth is an egoistic, rude abomination. Stay away from him.}
{160}{}{这对你很好。赛斯是个自私自利、粗鲁可憎的人。离他远点。}
### {161}{039}{Okay, let's change the subject.}
{161}{039}{好的，让我们换个话题。}
### {162}{999}{Right. See you then.}
{162}{999}{正确的到时见。}


### {170}{}{Oh, so you've met him. Did you find a common ground?}
{170}{}{哦，你见过他了。你找到共同点了吗？}
### {171}{016}{No, we have nothing to talk about.}
{171}{016}{不，我们没有什么可谈的。}
### {172}{018}{I played along a little. He seemed a little crazy.}
{172}{018}{我配合了一下。他看起来有点疯狂。}
### {173}{019}{Yes, I like how he sees things.}
{173}{019}{是的，我喜欢他看待事物的方式。}


### {180}{}{Smart. Don't play for too long though. You'll end up sharing his ideas.}
{180}{}{聪明的不过不要玩太久。你最终会分享他的想法。}
### {181}{009}{As I see, you are not very fond of your brother?}
{181}{009}{就我所见，你不是很喜欢你哥哥吗？}
### {182}{039}{Okay, let's change the subject.}
{182}{039}{好的，让我们换个话题。}


### {190}{}{That is just wonderful. What's next on your to-do list? Taking over the world? Another Great War?}
{190}{}{太棒了。你的下一个待办事项是什么？接管世界？又一次大战？}
### {191}{010}{Don't be ridiculous. Seth just wants to clean this town from filth. I can relate to that.}
{191}{010}{别开玩笑了。赛斯只是想把这个小镇从污秽中清理出来。我能理解这一点。}
### {192}{023}{You're going to end up bad anyway.}
{192}{023}{无论如何，你的结局都会很糟糕。}
### {193}{009}{As I see, you are not very fond of your brother?}
{193}{009}{就我所见，你不是很喜欢你哥哥吗？}
### {194}{039}{Let's change the subject.}
{194}{039}{让我们换个话题。}


### {200}{}{I wish you both well.}
{200}{}{我祝你们俩一切顺利。}
### {201}{999}{And to you too.}
{201}{999}{对你也是如此。}


### {210}{}{It's like bashing your head against the wall. I don't even want to make peace with him by now, I'm perfectly fine with the way things are.}
{210}{}{这就像把你的头撞在墙上。我现在甚至不想和他讲和，我对现在的情况完全满意。}
### {211}{022}{But it's wrong! Family should live in peace. I can help you both.}
{211}{022}{但这是错误的！一家人应该和平相处。我可以帮你们两个。}
### {212}{051}{It's okay, I'll bash some brotherly responsibility from this wall.}
{212}{051}{没关系，我会把一些兄弟般的责任从这堵墙上砸下来。}
### {213}{999}{Well, good for you. Bye then.}
{213}{999}{好吧，对你很好。再见。}


### {220}{}{Don't bother.}
{220}{}{别麻烦了。}
### {221}{999}{I'm still going to try.}
{221}{999}{我仍然会努力。}


### {230}{}{Oh yeah? And what are you going to do? Come on, spill it out! [he puts his hand on his belt, probably, ready to pull his weapon.]}
{230}{}{哦，是吗？你打算怎么办？来吧，把它说出来！[他把手放在腰带上，可能是准备拔出武器。]}
### {231}{025}{Me? Nothing. Everything is Seth's idea. Soon there's going to be an army from an underground settlement of Livos arriving here, which would mean the end of NWO. Seth will lead the takeover - with my personal assistance, of course. That's when you'll regret that you made your brother an enemy!}
{231}{025}{我没有什么一切都是赛斯的主意。很快就会有一支来自利沃斯地下定居点的军队抵达这里，这意味着西北战争的结束。赛斯将领导接管――当然还有我的私人协助。那时你会后悔你把你的兄弟变成了敌人！}
### {232}{999}{Forget it, nevermind.}
{232}{999}{算了，没关系。}


### {250}{}{[Matt becomes white, sweating] What?... Oh god, Seth... Just like with the slavers... How could you?! I won't go through it again.}
{250}{}{[马特脸色煞白，满头大汗]什么？。。。天啊，赛斯。。。就像对待奴隶主一样。。。你怎么可能？！我不会再经历一遍了。}
### {251}{}{What the hell are you blabbering about? What underground settlement? Who this idiot is going to lead? You are trying to fool the wrong guy, smart-ass.}
{251}{}{你到底在说什么？什么是地下定居点？这个白痴要领导谁？你想骗错人了，聪明人。}
### {252}{026a}{There are two options: either I go away and in twenty-four hours return with a squad of armed soldiers, who will burn this place to the ground, or you and I come to an agreement and I tell Seth that his plan about Livos has failed.}
{252}{026a}{有两种选择：要么我离开，24小时后带着一队武装士兵回来，他们会把这里夷为平地；要么你和我达成协议，我告诉赛斯，他关于利沃斯的计划失败了。}
### {253}{998}{[end]}
{253}{998}{[终止]}
### {254}{026}{I was just kidding, calm down.}
{254}{026}{我只是开玩笑，冷静点。}


### {265}{}{You... You are insane. I'm not a boy, you know, I have a weak heart. Considering my childhood...}
{265}{}{你你疯了。我不是男孩，你知道，我的心很弱。考虑到我的童年。。。}
### {266}{039}{Sorry. Let's talk about something else.}
{266}{039}{很抱歉让我们谈谈其他事情。}
### {267}{999}{[end]}
{267}{999}{[终止]}


### {260}{}{[Matt's face starts trembling. He is whining] I'll give you everything I have, only don't make me go through this nightmare again!}
{260}{}{[马特的脸开始颤抖。他在抱怨]我会给你我所拥有的一切，只是不要让我再次经历这场噩梦！}
### {261}{027}{500.}
{261}{027}{500}
### {262}{028}{1000!}
{262}{028}{1000！}
### {263}{029}{Uhh... 1500!}
{263}{029}{嗯。。。1500！}
### {264}{029}{2000?...}
{264}{029}{2000？。。。}


### {270}{}{Take it. Just promise me you won't do this.}
{270}{}{拿着，答应我你不会这么做的。}
### {271}{999}{Deal.}
{271}{999}{处理}


### {280}{}{Take it. Just promise me you won't do this.}
{280}{}{拿着，答应我你不会这么做的。}
### {281}{999}{Deal.}
{281}{999}{处理}


### {290}{}{Oh god... [He is crying] Where do I get such money? [suddenly, he becomes furious] Get out!! Out of here!! I know what he's trying to do, and he is going to get it!!}
{290}{}{天啊。。。[他哭了]我从哪里得到这么多钱？[突然，他勃然大怒]滚出去！！离开这里！！我知道他想做什么，他会成功的！！}
### {291}{999}{[end]}
{291}{999}{[终止]}


### {300}{}{You are right. I can stay inside my tent, enjoying doing what I like the most.}
{300}{}{你是对的。我可以呆在帐篷里，享受做我最喜欢的事情。}
### {301}{035}{And what it would be?}
{301}{035}{那会是什么呢？}
### {302}{999}{Let's talk later.}
{302}{999}{我们稍后再谈。}


### {310}{}{Oh, I see you've noticed! This is my special over-baked ham from Lavash hindquarters. Take a bite, it's just out of the oven.}
{310}{}{哦，我看你注意到了！这是我特制的拉瓦什后腿烤火腿。咬一口，刚出炉。}
### {311}{032}{Gladly!}
{311}{032}{很高兴！}
### {312}{033}{From hind... What? Thanks, but I'm not eating the food with such an unappetizing name.}
{312}{033}{从后面。。。什么谢谢，但我不会吃这么不讨人喜欢的名字的食物。}


### {320}{}{[You try a slice of fragrant meat on a gravy with spices. It melts in your mouth instantly. You become speechless for the next few seconds.]}
{320}{}{[你试着在加香料的肉汁上放一片香肉。它在你嘴里瞬间融化。在接下来的几秒钟里，你变得无言以对。]}
### {321}{037}{I've never eaten anything tastier.}
{321}{037}{我从来没有吃过更美味的东西。}
### {322}{037}{A little bitter, but will do.}
{322}{037}{有点苦，但会的。}


### {331}{}{Haha! Hindquarter is a hip part of Lavash. This name was used in old culinary books. Well, if you don't want - suit yourself, I won't be forcing you.}
{331}{}{哈哈！后臀是拉瓦什的臀部。这个名字被用在古老的烹饪书籍中。好吧，如果你不想适合自己，我不会强迫你。}
### {332}{034}{Meh...}
{332}{034}{嗯。。。}
### {333}{032}{Okay, I'm convinced, let me try it!}
{333}{032}{好吧，我确信，让我试试吧！}
### {334}{999}{Let's talk later.}
{334}{999}{我们稍后再谈。}


### {340}{}{Are you a vegetarian? Sorry pal, I can't help you then. In my menu, there's only meat.}
{340}{}{你是素食主义者吗？对不起，朋友，那我帮不了你。我的菜单上只有肉。}
### {341}{035}{What do you do here?}
{341}{035}{你在这里做什么？}
### {342}{999}{Okay, let's talk later.}
{342}{999}{好的，我们稍后再谈。}


### {350}{}{It could sound a little self-absorbed, but I'm a reclusive cook. Making food is my only passion in life. I don't understand when people treat food as something they just need to fill their stomachs with. What I really like is to create an unusual mix of flavors from usual products. Here, for example [he shows you a piece of meat] - this is a slice of Lavash meat cooked in a really special way. You won't find it anywhere else.}
{350}{}{这听起来可能有点自我陶醉，但我是一个隐居的厨师。做食物是我一生中唯一的爱好。我不明白人们什么时候把食物当作填饱肚子的东西。我真正喜欢的是从通常的产品中创造出一种不同寻常的口味组合。例如，在这里[他给你看一块肉]――这是一片用非常特殊的方式烹制的熔岩肉。你在其他地方找不到它。}
### {351}{036}{How are you doing this?}
{351}{036}{你是怎么做到的？}
### {352}{038}{Why people around here don't know about you?}
{352}{038}{为什么这里的人不知道你？}
### {353}{039}{I have no time to talk about this. Better tell me something else...}
{353}{039}{我没有时间谈论这个。最好告诉我别的事。。。}
### {354}{999}{Talk later.}
{354}{999}{稍后再谈。}


### {360}{}{We have plenty of Lavash meat. In addition, I gather rare herbs that I know of. But lately it becomes harder. And to eat only meat all the time is, you know... Tiresome.}
{360}{}{我们有很多熔岩肉。此外，我收集我所知道的稀有草药。但最近变得更难了。而且一直只吃肉，你知道。。。讨厌的}
### {361}{040}{I could look for new products for you to cook with.}
{361}{040}{我可以为你寻找新的烹饪产品。}
### {362}{039}{I see. I want to ask something else.}
{362}{039}{我明白了。我想问别的问题。}


### {370}{}{Thanks. If there is at least one grateful customer, it means I am not cooking in vain. [he sadly smiles]}
{370}{}{谢谢如果至少有一位心怀感激的顾客，那就意味着我没有白做饭。[他悲伤地笑了笑]}
### {371}{038}{Why people around here don't know about you?}
{371}{038}{为什么这里的人不知道你？}
### {372}{039}{I want to ask something.}
{372}{039}{我想问个问题。}


### {380}{}{I don't like to be an eyesore for the locals. This place is not as calm as it looks like... It may seem stupid, but I'm alone, and I have no one to protect me. I'd be better off sitting quietly, cooking my favorite dishes, with no one threatening me.}
{380}{}{我不喜欢成为当地人的眼中钉。这个地方不像看上去那么平静。。。这可能看起来很愚蠢，但我一个人，没有人保护我。我最好安静地坐着，做我最喜欢的菜，没有人威胁我。}
### {381}{036}{Where do you get your ingredients?}
{381}{036}{你的原料是从哪里来的？}
### {382}{039}{I see. I want to ask something else.}
{382}{039}{我明白了。我想问别的问题。}


### {390}{}{What is it that interests you?}
{390}{}{你感兴趣的是什么？}
### {391}{035}{Tell me about yourself.}
{391}{035}{告诉我你自己的情况。}
### {392}{009}{Tell me about Seth.}
{392}{009}{告诉我关于赛斯的事。}
### {393}{006}{Why are you so reclusive?}
{393}{006}{你为什么这么孤僻？}
### {394}{999}{I'll ask questions another time. See you.}
{394}{999}{我下次再问问题。再见}


### {400}{}{You could? [he suspiciously looks around, then whispers] I heard rumors about an underground treasury of food supply. They say that all kinds of pre-war delicacies are kept there! Meat dishes from the creatures that are no longer present in our world, the fruits and the plants you have never seen! You could make a heavenly lunch from these ingredients! But I don't know anyone who is able to tell where this place is...}
{400}{}{你可以吗？[他怀疑地环顾四周，然后窃窃私语]我听到了关于地下粮食供应库的传言。他们说那里保存着各种战前的美食！来自我们世界上不再存在的生物、你从未见过的水果和植物的肉类菜肴！你可以用这些食材做一顿美味的午餐！但我不知道有谁能说出这个地方在哪里。。。}
### {401}{041}{Does it have a name?}
{401}{041}{它有名字吗？}
### {402}{042}{That's not for me. I don't chase myths.}
{402}{042}{这不适合我。我不追逐神话。}


### {410}{}{Livos. I think this is how it's called. If you find it for me, I will cook the most unbelievable dishes in your life! [he gulps]}
{410}{}{利沃斯。我想这就是它的名字。如果你帮我找到它，我会做你一生中最令人难以置信的菜！[他狼吞虎咽]}
### {411}{043}{Deal, I'll try to find the place.}
{411}{043}{成交，我会设法找到那个地方。}
### {412}{042}{No, it seems too improbable to me.}
{412}{042}{不，我觉得这太不可能了。}


### {420}{}{All that's left for me is to believe in such improbable things. What else can I hope for?}
{420}{}{我所剩下的就是相信这些不可思议的事情。我还能指望什么？}
### {421}{039}{Let's talk about something else.}
{421}{039}{让我们谈谈其他事情。}
### {422}{043}{Okay, I'll look for your Livos.}
{422}{043}{好的，我去找你的丽芙。}
### {423}{999}{Cheer up. I'll see you later.}
{423}{999}{振作起来我待会儿见。}


### {430}{}{[Matt brightens up] Thank you so much! Return when finding the place! I'll be ready with a lot of spices by that moment.}
{430}{}{[马特高兴起来]非常感谢！找到地方后返回！到那时我会准备好很多香料的。}
### {431}{999}{See you then.}
{431}{999}{到时见。}


### {100}{}{Get the hell away. I don't talk with Seth's errand boys.}
{100}{}{滚出去。我不和赛斯的差役们说话。}
### {102}{}{[leave]}
{102}{}{[离开]}
### {101}{043a}{I have a message from Seth. }
{101}{043a}{我有赛斯的消息。}
