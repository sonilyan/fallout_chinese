#{100}{}{You see a farmer.}
{100}{}{你看到一个农夫。}
#{101}{}{You see a respected resident of Bridgeport, the head of a family.}
{101}{}{你看到一个受人尊敬的布里奇波特居民，一个家族的首领。}
#{102}{}{My son was killed... This means war! From now on, any biker I see is a deadman.}
{102}{}{我儿子被杀了。。。这意味着战争！从现在起，我看到的任何一个骑车人都是死人。}
#{103}{}{Just give me a reason!}
{103}{}{给我个理由！}
#{104}{}{Hello}
{104}{}{你好}
#{110}{}{Stop there! Who are you? If you17re one of the bikers, then get the fuck back outside! This is my house, and I'm not going to share it, you freeloader scum!}
{110}{}{住手！你是谁？如果你是一个摩托车手，那就他妈的滚出去！这是我的房子，我不想和你分享，你这个白手起家的人渣！}
#{111}{}{Calm down. I'm not a biker, I17m just a traveler.}
{111}{}{冷静。我不是骑自行车的，我只是个旅行者。}
#{112}{}{[Skeptically looking] Is that so? Fine, you can stay here for now if you want. Just watch yourself - otherwise, you'll be running away from here like a bitten brahmin.}
{112}{}{[怀疑地看着]是这样吗？好吧，如果你愿意的话，你可以暂时呆在这里。小心你自己-否则，你会像一个被咬的婆罗门一样逃离这里。}
#{113}{}{Okay, okay.}
{113}{}{好吧，好吧。}
#{114}{}{Well? What is it?}
{114}{}{好？这是怎么一回事？}
#{115}{}{Nothing, I just didn17t have anyone to talk to. Bye.}
{115}{}{没什么，我只是没人说话。再见。}
#{116}{}{Tell me about the bikers.}
{116}{}{告诉我关于摩托车手的事。}
#{117}{}{Why do you hate bikers so much?}
{117}{}{你为什么这么讨厌骑车人？}
#{118}{}{I17m interested, how do you survive in this wilderness?}
{118}{}{我很感兴趣，你是如何在这片荒野中生存的？}
#{119}{}{They never came here in large numbers before. We never had any problems with them. And now they just come here in packs. I can17t understand what drives them here. And it doesn't matter - I just want them to leave. My wife and I can17t even sleep at night with them outside.}
{119}{}{他们以前从未大批来过这里。我们从来没有和他们有过任何问题。现在他们只是成群结队地来这里。我不明白是什么驱使他们来到这里。没关系-我只是想让他们离开。我妻子和我晚上都不能和他们在外面睡觉。}
#{120}{}{Why should I like them? I17m working my ass off to feed my family. And these marauders just got themselves some bikes and guns to play the tough guys. I would like to see them try to stay here and work on the crops for a few years! Although, of course, this is not my main gripe with them. They can live as they want to, I just want them to stay away from me and away from Bridgeport.}
{120}{}{我为什么要喜欢它们？我拼命工作养家糊口。这些掠夺者给自己弄了一些自行车和枪来对付那些硬汉。我希望他们能在这里工作几年！当然，这不是我对他们的主要抱怨。他们可以随心所欲地生活，我只希望他们远离我，远离布里奇波特。}
#{121}{}{As you can see - we work all day. Only constant work helps us forget about our problems. It is really interesting how we live here, but ask someone else, I17m not in the mood. My neighbour loves to run his mouth.}
{121}{}{如你所见，我们整天工作。只有不断的工作才能帮助我们忘记自己的问题。我们在这里的生活真的很有趣，但是问问别人，我没心情。我的邻居爱唠叨。}
#{122}{}{Perhaps that's enough talk for today. I have to go, see you.}
{122}{}{也许今天的谈话到此为止。我得走了，再见。}
#{123}{}{Bikers are my family, so watch your mouth, daddy, before you get kicked in the face.}
{123}{}{骑自行车的是我的家人，所以爸爸，在你被踢到脸之前，小心你的嘴。}
#{124}{}{So that's how it17s going to be! You fucking brat, go wipe the breast milk from your lips! Just give me a reason - and I will blow your brains out.}
{124}{}{所以事情就是这样！你这个混蛋，去把你嘴唇上的母乳擦干净！只要给我个理由-我就把你的脑袋炸了。}
#{125}{}{Hey now, take a breath. If I wanted to fight, then I17d start shooting without warning, don17t you doubt it.}
{125}{}{嘿，现在，深呼吸。如果我想打架，我会毫无预兆地开枪，你不要怀疑。}
#{126}{}{And that guy at the entrance with working hands is a biker too?}
{126}{}{入口处那个手在工作的家伙也是个摩托车手？}
#{127}{}{Looks like your son is going to do all it takes to become a biker.}
{127}{}{看来你儿子会尽一切努力成为一名摩托车手。}
#{128}{}{Some could only be glad. Your son was happy to leave this place with bikers.}
{128}{}{有些人只能高兴。你儿子很高兴和摩托车手一起离开这里。}
#{129}{}{[Through gritted teeth] My son is a fool! He is too naive, he doesn17t understand what he17s getting into. How did I raise him for him to end up like this...}
{129}{}{我儿子是个傻瓜！他太天真了，他不明白自己在干什么。我怎么把他养大让他变成这样。。。}
#{130}{}{It will be hard to change his mind.}
{130}{}{他很难改变主意。}
#{131}{}{He just doesn17t understands yet. Having your own home - what can be better? He decided to exchange his family for the highway. Dtupid fool... By the time he understands that this is a waste of his life, it will be too late. He needs to have some sense beaten into him, before that scum take him away from home. Can you help?}
{131}{}{他只是还不明白。有自己的家-还有什么比这更好的呢？他决定用家人换高速公路。傻瓜。。。等他明白这是在浪费他的生命时，就太晚了。在那个人渣把他从家里带走之前，他需要有点理智。你能帮忙吗？}
#{132}{}{I don17t know... How do we do that?}
{132}{}{我不知道。。。我们怎么做？}
#{133}{}{I have no idea. But I17m sure that we must humiliate the bikers in his eyes. Find something against them, show that dealing with them is dangerous. It would be even better if they all were dead. But it would be dangerous to risk it. Only one hope is left to me - that the bikers will leave, without letting him join their ranks. Can you help make that happen?}
{133}{}{我不知道。但我确信我们必须在他眼里羞辱那些骑自行车的人。找出对他们不利的东西，表明与他们打交道是危险的。如果他们都死了就更好了。但冒这个险是很危险的。我只剩下一个希望了――骑自行车的人会离开，不让他加入他们的行列。你能帮忙吗？}
#{134}{}{Okay, I'll try to get rid of bikers and save your son.}
{134}{}{好吧，我会尽力摆脱骑自行车的人，救你儿子。}
#{135}{}{Thanks. Now we will need any help we can get.}
{135}{}{谢谢。现在我们需要任何能得到的帮助。}
#{136}{}{[Leave]}
{136}{}{[离开]}
#{137}{}{Sorry, but I won17t get involved in a family matter. If the guy wants to be a biker - it17s his choice. Bye.}
{137}{}{对不起，但我不会介入家庭事务。如果这个人想成为一个摩托车手-这是他的选择。再见。}
#{138}{}{Dante left with the bikers. It was impossible to stop him.}
{138}{}{但丁和摩托车手一起走了。阻止他是不可能的。}
#{139}{}{I know. I won17t wait for him to come back. It was his biggest mistake. If only I could have stopped him... If only...}
{139}{}{我知道。我不会等他回来的。这是他最大的错误。如果我能阻止他。。。只要。。。}
#{140}{}{[Leave]}
{140}{}{[离开]}
#{141}{}{Now, with the bikers gone, your son has nowhere to go.}
{141}{}{现在，摩托车手走了，你儿子无处可去。}
#{142}{}{The most important thing is - the bikers proved themselves weak they could not even handle us. This will serve as a good lesson for my son. Especially after I beat the shit out of him.}
{142}{}{最重要的是-骑自行车的人证明了他们自己的软弱，他们甚至不能对付我们。这对我儿子来说是一个很好的教训。尤其是在我把他打得屁滚尿流之后。}
#{143}{}{Great. Well, I will leave you two alone then.}
{143}{}{伟大的。好吧，那我就让你们两个单独呆着。}
#{144}{}{I managed to convince Dante to stay home.}
{144}{}{我设法说服但丁呆在家里。}
#{145}{}{Unbelievable! Only a beating his back with a stick would convince him before, and you managed to do this with only words? How unexpected. I hope that he learned his lesson. Thank you for your help. Consider yourself a guest at my house from now on.}
{145}{}{难以置信！以前只有用棍子打他的背才能让他信服，而你只用语言就能做到这一点？真出乎意料。我希望他吸取了教训。谢谢你的帮助。从现在起你就当我的客人了。}
#{146}{}{Thank you for getting rid of those two-wheeled gorillas. Sure, they may come back. But the most important thing is - they abandoned Dante and left him behind. This will be a good lesson. Especially after I beat the shit out of him.}
{146}{}{谢谢你摆脱了那些两轮大猩猩。当然，他们可能会回来。但最重要的是-他们抛弃了但丁，把他留在了身后。这将是一个很好的教训。尤其是在我把他打得屁滚尿流之后。}
#{147}{}{Well, I will leave you two alone then.}
{147}{}{好吧，那我就让你们两个单独呆着。}
#{150}{}{I can help get rid of the bikers.}
{150}{}{我可以帮你摆脱那些骑自行车的人。}
#{151}{}{You? Alone, against several well-armed bandits - it would not be easy. [squinting in disbelief] And why would you help us? We are not relatives or even neighbors, and we have nothing to pay. But, to think about it, you can loot many good stuff off their corpses.}
{151}{}{你呢？一个人，对付几个武装精良的土匪――这可不容易。你为什么要帮助我们？我们不是亲戚，甚至不是邻居，我们没有什么可支付的。但是，想想看，你可以从他们的尸体上掠夺很多好东西。}
#{152}{}{There can be other options, beside murder. I will have to think about this.}
{152}{}{除了谋杀，还有其他选择。我得考虑一下。}
#{153}{}{Just as I promised, the bikers will no longer cause problems in Bridgeport.}
{153}{}{正如我所承诺的，骑自行车的人不会再给布里奇波特带来麻烦了。}
#{154}{}{Thank you so much. Nice to hear those words after all this. I hope you'll stay around for a little longer.}
{154}{}{非常感谢。很高兴听到这些话。我希望你能多呆一会儿。}
#{155}{}{}
{155}{}{}
#{156}{}{Bye.}
{156}{}{再见。}
