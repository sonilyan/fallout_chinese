### {10}{}{[You see a tall, slender woman. Her movements are very slow-paced and she looks at the people around her with a definitive superiority. She doesn't even try to hide it] Who is it that came to us? Another lowlife from Radius? What such useless thing like you would want from such an important person like me?}
{10}{}{[你看到一个又高又瘦的女人。她的动作很慢，她以一种绝对的优越感看着周围的人。她甚至没有试图掩饰]是谁来找我们？另一个来自Radius的卑鄙小人？像我这样重要的人，你会想要什么像你这样无用的东西？}

{14}{005}{你他妈的在开玩笑吗？想知道我们两个谁是卑鄙小人吗？}
### {15}{006}{Important person? You are just an arrogant bitch, there are hundreds like you around.}
{15}{006}{重要人物？你只是一个傲慢的婊子，周围有几百个像你一样的人。}

### {20}{}{[The woman contemptuously squints] I have the right to use any words and phrases I please. Note, that you dare to initiate the conversation with me, despite the colossal differences in our social statuses. Know that I am Emily Dunton, the ruler of Livos. Do you understand how great my condescension and kindness is to just talk to you back?}
{20}{}{[那个女人轻蔑地眯着眼睛]我有权随意使用任何词语。请注意，尽管我们的社会地位存在巨大差异，但你敢于主动与我交谈。要知道我是艾米丽・邓顿，利沃斯的统治者。你能理解我对你顶嘴的屈尊俯就和善意有多大吗？}
### {21}{008}{I'm new at Livos. And I want to know more about people who run it.}
{21}{008}{我是利沃斯的新手。我想更多地了解管理它的人。}
### {22}{007}{As for me, you are just a bitch with an inflated ego.}
{22}{007}{对我来说，你只是一个自我膨胀的婊子。}
### {23}{999}{I am sorry, Emily, I won't be bothering you anymore.}
{23}{999}{对不起，艾米丽，我不会再打扰你了。}


### {30}{}{[The woman raises her head even more] My condescension and kindness are so great that I forgive you your ignorance. I am Emily Dunton, the ruler of Livos. Do you realize what luck it is for you to have a conversation with me?}
{30}{}{[那个女人更加抬起头来]我的屈尊俯就和仁慈是如此之大，以至于我原谅你的无知。我是艾米丽・邓顿，利沃斯的统治者。你知道和我谈话对你来说是多么幸运吗？}
### {31}{008}{I'm new at Livos. And I want to know more about people who run it.}

{33}{999}{对不起，艾米丽，我不会再打扰你了。}


### {40}{}{[The woman slightly nods] Looks like you are not as block-headed as the most of inhabitants here. You've felt the difference in our social statuses right away. I am Emily Dunton, the ruler of Livos. What was the reason that made you distract me from my current occupation?}
{40}{}{[女人微微点头]看起来你不像这里的大多数居民那样头脑迟钝。你马上就感受到了我们社会地位的不同。我是艾米丽・邓顿，利沃斯的统治者。是什么原因让你分散了我对目前职业的注意力？}

{43}{999}{对不起，艾米丽，我不会再打扰你了。}


### {50}{}{[The woman doesn't react to your aggression in the slightest. She only raised her eyebrow a little] I'm not surprised at all to see such manners from someone outside. I will never lower myself to your level, using brute violence to solve problems. I am Emily Dunton, the ruler of Livos. Do you realize what luck it is for you to have a conversation with me?}
{50}{}{[这个女人对你的攻击一点反应都没有。她只是微微扬起眉毛]看到外面的人这么有礼貌，我一点也不惊讶。我永远不会把自己降低到你的水平，用暴力来解决问题。我是艾米丽・邓顿，利沃斯的统治者。你知道和我谈话对你来说是多么幸运吗？}
### {51}{008}{I'm new in Livos. And I want to know more about people who run it.}

### {60}{}{[The woman contemptuously looks at you] I have no desire to continue the dialogue with some rudderless ruffian like you. Know that I am Emily Dunton, the ruler of Livos. And now get out, you, worm. I am not in the mood to tolerate your presence anymore.}
{60}{}{[女人轻蔑地看着你]我不想再和你这样的无舵痞子继续对话了。要知道我是艾米丽・邓顿，利沃斯的统治者。现在滚出去，你这个小虫子。我再也没有心情容忍你的出现了。}
### {61}{999}{Didn't really want to keep it going. Bye.}
{61}{999}{我真的不想让它继续下去。再见}
### {62}{007}{I myself decide, when to go and when to stay. And now I decide to stay.}
{62}{007}{我自己决定，什么时候去，什么时候留下。现在我决定留下来。}


### {70}{}{[Emily angrily clenches her fists and starts shouting] Get away from here, you miserable nobody!}

{82}{999}{我最好稍后再来。再见}


### {1001}{}{On what questions of yours should I shed the light of my wisdom?}
{1001}{}{关于你的哪些问题，我应该用我的智慧来阐明？}
### {1002}{}{What made you ask for my cleverness again?}
{1002}{}{是什么让你再次要求我聪明？}
### {1003}{}{What do you want here? Get out, you mindless worm!}
{1003}{}{你想在这里干什么？滚出去，你这个没头脑的虫子！}
### {101}{012}{Ludwig had lost his book on wave science. Was it you who took it?}

### {104}{017}{What can you tell me about Livos?}
{104}{017}{关于利沃斯，你能告诉我什么？}
### {105}{025}{I have completed the assignment. Monsters aren't threatening the Livos anymore.}
{105}{025}{我已经完成了作业。怪物不再威胁利沃斯人了。}
### {106}{031}{Emily, I'd like to play cards with you.}
{106}{031}{艾米丽，我想和你一起打牌。}

### {109}{999}{I think I need to go.}
{109}{999}{我想我得走了。}


### {110}{}{[Emily looks grossed out] I am indifferent to the desires of animals from such a hole as NWO. I won't put myself to their level to make any kind of plans together, in any field of activity.}
{110}{}{[艾米丽看起来很恶心]我对来自NWO这样一个洞的动物的欲望漠不关心。我不会把自己放在他们的水平上，在任何活动领域一起制定任何计划。}
### {111}{010}{Okay. I have other questions.}
{111}{010}{可以我还有其他问题。}


### {120}{}{[Emily arrogantly glances at you] If you had a talk with Ludwig, you have surely noticed the chaos and mess which is his living quarters. I don't visit his laboratories, because otherwise, I would have to clean myself from dirt and dust for several days. That's why I have nothing to do with Ludwig's book.}
{120}{}{[埃米莉傲慢地瞥了你一眼]如果你和路德维希谈过，你肯定注意到了他的生活区的混乱。我不去他的实验室，因为否则，我将不得不在几天内清理自己的污垢和灰尘。这就是为什么我与路德维希的书无关。}
### {121}{010}{I'd like to ask something else.}
{121}{010}{我想问些别的问题。}
### {122}{999}{I'll go look in other places then.}
{122}{999}{那我去其他地方看看。}




### {130}{}{[Emily calms down a little] Make your assumptions about why our previous communication wasn't constructive.}
{130}{}{[艾米丽稍微冷静下来]假设一下为什么我们之前的沟通没有建设性。}
### {131}{014}{I talked bad things about you and insulted your dignity. For that I am sorry.}
{131}{014}{我说了你的坏事，侮辱了你的尊严。对此我感到抱歉。}
### {132}{015}{I talked bad things about you and insulted your dignity. But you must admit that I was somehow right.}

### {133}{015}{I called things by their proper names. You are exactly as I said.}
{133}{015}{我直呼其名。你和我说的一模一样。}
### {134}{016}{I was right and you didn't want to admit it. }
{134}{016}{我是对的，而你不想承认。}
### {135}{016}{I was right and you didn't want to admit it. And I'm waiting for you to apologize.}
{135}{016}{我是对的，你不想承认。我在等你道歉。}




### {140}{}{[Emily looks completely calm] Considering the fact that you have spent many days in a destructive environment of an outside world, I accept your apologies. I am counting on the fact that such incidents won't happen in the future.}
{140}{}{[艾米丽看起来完全平静]考虑到你在外面世界的破坏性环境中度过了很多天，我接受你的道歉。我指望这样的事件将来不会发生。}
### {141}{010}{I would hope so. For now, I want to ask something.}
{141}{010}{我希望如此。现在，我想问一些问题。}
### {142}{999}{I'm glad we've sorted out our disagreements. But now I need to go.}
{142}{999}{我很高兴我们解决了分歧。但现在我需要走了。}




### {150}{}{[Emily's face twists with anger] You understood completely nothing. I won't continue the dialogue with ignorance of such kind. Get out.}
{150}{}{[艾米丽的脸因愤怒而扭曲]你什么都不懂。我不会在这种无知的情况下继续对话。滚出去。}
### {151}{999}{I was going to. Bye.}
{151}{999}{我本来打算去的，再见。}
### {152}{016}{We are not done yet. I will not go anywhere.}
{152}{016}{我们还没有结束。我哪儿也不去。}




### {160}{}{[She is visibly shaking with hatred] Get away from my sight, worm! You don't deserve even to be standing near me!}
{160}{}{[她明显因仇恨而颤抖]滚远点，虫子！你根本不配站在我身边！}
### {161}{999}{Okay, calm down. I'm leaving.}
{161}{999}{好的，冷静下来。我要走了。}
### {162}{998}{Or what?}
{162}{998}{还是怎样}




### {170}{}{Livos is my domain. I am the one and only leader of this place. My stellar skills in politics are reflected best in the way I run this vault. I effortlessly rule these worthless little people.}
{170}{}{利沃斯是我的地盘。我是这个地方唯一的领导人。我出色的政治技巧最好地体现在我管理这个金库的方式上。我毫不费力地统治着这些毫无价值的小人物。}
### {171}{026}{How exactly do you rule them?}
{171}{026}{你究竟是如何统治他们的？}
### {172}{018}{Can I help you with ruling the vault?}
{172}{018}{我能帮你管理保险库吗？}
### {173}{028}{What about others? Do they know that you treat them with such disdain?}
{173}{028}{其他人呢？他们知道你如此蔑视他们吗？}
### {174}{029}{What is there to do here?}
{174}{029}{这里有什么可做的？}


### {1801}{}{[Emily gives you evaluating look] You don't have the proper status for leadership. Do my previous assignment and your status will be changed.}
{1801}{}{[Emily给你评价的眼神]你没有合适的领导地位。完成我以前的任务，你的状态就会改变。}
### {1802}{}{[Emily gives you evaluating look] You don't have the proper status for leadership. But you are assigned to the duties of my personal junior assistant. You can be rightfully proud.}
{1802}{}{[Emily给你评价的眼神]你没有合适的领导地位。但你被分配到我的私人初级助理的职责。你可以理所当然地感到自豪。}
### {1803}{}{[Emily gives you evaluating look] You don't have the proper status for leadership. But you do have an opportunity to strengthen your reputation here and increase the influence on the Livos residents. If you are capable of completing the task involving risking your life, I will assign you to the position of my personal junior assistant. Your status and influence would change greatly. I could run the things here more effectively, while you would have additional privileges.}
{1803}{}{[Emily给你评价的眼神]你没有合适的领导地位。但你确实有机会加强你在这里的声誉，并增加对利沃斯居民的影响。如果你有能力冒着生命危险完成任务，我会指派你担任我的私人初级助理。你的地位和影响力将发生巨大变化。我可以更有效地管理这里的事务，而您将拥有额外的特权。}
### {181}{017}{I'm not ready to take risks for now. What were you mentioning about Livos?}
{181}{017}{我现在还没有准备好冒险。你刚才提到利沃斯的什么？}
### {182}{020}{I am ready for a dangerous job. What is needed to do?}
{182}{020}{我已经做好了做危险工作的准备。需要做什么？}
### {183}{010}{I want to ask another question.}
{183}{010}{我想再问一个问题。}
### {184}{999}{I need to finish some business, I'll be back later.}
{184}{999}{我需要完成一些业务，我稍后会回来。}
### {185}{019}{I don't want to help you enforce your power. I hate your dictatorship.}
{185}{019}{我不想帮你行使权力。我讨厌你的独裁统治。}




### {190}{}{[Emily gets furious] How dare you to talk to me like that! You belong to the excrements, worm! Get out!}
{190}{}{[艾米丽勃然大怒]你怎么敢那样跟我说话！你属于排泄物，蠕虫！滚出去！}
### {191}{999}{I was just going to.}
{191}{999}{我本来打算去的。}




### {200}{}{The task won't be simple. A little while ago, on the floor of the filter room appeared a hole, leading to a cave. That cave is filled with dangerous monstrous creatures, who can crawl out at any time and kill everyone in Livos. Your mission is to ensure the safety of the vault.}
{200}{}{任务并不简单。不久前，过滤室的地板上出现了一个洞，通向一个洞穴。那个洞穴里充满了危险的怪物，它们可以随时爬出来杀死利沃斯的所有人。你的任务是确保金库的安全。}
### {201}{021}{How would I do that?}
{201}{021}{我该怎么做？}




### {210}{}{I don't care what way you'll choose for protecting Livos. You can murder all monsters, you can barricade the hole. The option doesn't matter. The result does.}
{210}{}{我不在乎你会选择什么方式来保护利沃斯。你可以杀死所有的怪物，你可以堵住洞。选择并不重要。结果确实如此。}
### {211}{999}{Okay. I'll go carry out the task.}
{211}{999}{可以我去执行任务。}
### {212}{022}{Okay. I'll go carry out the task.}
{212}{022}{可以我去执行任务。}
### {213}{023}{Sure. I'm going to rip them into pieces very fast!}
{213}{023}{当然我要很快把它们撕成碎片！}
### {214}{024}{Sure. I'm going to rip them into pieces very fast!}
{214}{024}{当然我要很快把它们撕成碎片！}

### {220}{}{Wait. I'll put some amount of batteries at your disposal for completing the task.}
{220}{}{等待为了完成任务，我会给你一些电池。}
### {221}{999}{Thanks. I'll get back when it's done.}
{221}{999}{谢谢做完后我会回来的。}

### {230}{}{Wait. I'll put some amount of batteries at your disposal for completing the task. Also, I took notice that you are quite fond of dealing with problems using brute force. Take this instrument. With its help, you'll get the job done in no time.}
{230}{}{等待为了完成任务，我会给你一些电池。此外，我注意到你非常喜欢用蛮力处理问题。拿着这个仪器。有了它的帮助，你很快就能完成这项工作。}
### {231}{999}{Cool! Little monsters, here I come!}
{231}{999}{凉的小怪物，我来了！}

### {240}{}{Wait. I took notice that you are quite fond of dealing with problems using brute force. Take this instrument. With its help, you'll get the job done in no time.}
{240}{}{等待我注意到你很喜欢用蛮力处理问题。拿着这个仪器。有了它的帮助，你很快就能完成这项工作。}
### {241}{999}{Cool! Little monsters, here I come!}
{241}{999}{凉的小怪物，我来了！}


### {250}{}{You have completed the task brilliantly. I should admit - I am quite impressed with the quality of the result. Because of that, I am rewarding you with this voice modulator.}
{250}{}{你出色地完成了任务。我应该承认――我对结果的质量印象深刻。正因为如此，我用这个语音调制器来奖励你。}
### {251}{999}{Whoa, you can use tech to imitate someone's voice? It will surely come in handy.}
{251}{999}{哇，你能用科技模仿别人的声音吗？它肯定会派上用场。}

### {260}{}{[Emily smugly smiles] My subtle leadership is done through manipulations with a consciousness of each of the vault residents. I recall there was an ancient phrase, which I believe belongs to one of my ancestors - "divide and conquer". And that is my exact method of ruling. I made each family believe in their exclusivity and importance for the life and fate of Livos. And now they are more concerned with their own significance, rather than with taking notice of what's happening around them. If one of the families starts to take advantage, I undertake some activities to weaken it. I throw them ideas on the official meetings - and they make it look like they are their own, never realizing the truth. Pathetic bunch of worthless pompous insects!}
{260}{}{[艾米丽得意地笑了笑]我微妙的领导是通过操纵每个金库居民的意识来完成的。我记得有一个古老的短语，我相信它属于我的祖先之一――“分而治之”。这就是我的确切裁决方法。我让每个家庭都相信他们的独特性和对利沃斯的生活和命运的重要性。现在，他们更关心自己的意义，而不是关注周围发生的事情。如果其中一个家庭开始利用它，我会采取一些行动来削弱它。我会在官方会议上向他们抛出想法――他们会让事情看起来像是他们自己的，永远不会意识到真相。可怜的一群毫无价值的浮夸昆虫！}
### {261}{027}{What if I would tell them about it?}
{261}{027}{如果我把这件事告诉他们怎么办？}

### {270}{}{[Emily chuckles] No one would listen to you! They are so accustomed to viewing themselves as the center of the universe that they became unable to see obvious things and listen to constructive criticism! Miserable losers - that's who they are!}
{270}{}{[艾米丽笑了笑]没人会听你的！他们太习惯于把自己视为宇宙的中心，以至于他们无法看到显而易见的事情，也无法听取建设性的批评！可怜的失败者――他们就是这样！}
### {271}{017}{I see. Tell me more about Livos.}
{271}{017}{我明白了。告诉我更多关于利沃斯的信息。}
### {272}{010}{I want to ask something on another topic.}
{272}{010}{我想问另一个话题。}
### {273}{999}{Damn, I need to get out of this place... Bye.}
{273}{999}{该死，我得离开这个地方。。。再见}
### {274}{019}{You are a self-righteous dictator! You make me sick!}
{274}{019}{你是个自以为是的独裁者！你让我恶心！}

### {280}{}{I have a right to think as I please. According to paragraph 5 of our Constitution, "Each inhabitant of the New World has the right to think of others, and of the New World itself, anything they see fit". That concludes that I am not worried even a bit with the opinion of others about my persona. In my turn, I don't consider it necessary to hide my arrogance to all these pathetic and petty worms.}
{280}{}{我有权随心所欲地思考。根据我国宪法第5段，“新世界的每一位居民都有权为他人和新世界本身考虑他们认为合适的任何事情”。由此得出的结论是，我一点也不担心别人对我个人形象的看法。反过来，我认为没有必要对这些可怜的小虫子掩饰我的傲慢。}
### {281}{017}{I want to ask more about Livos.}
{281}{017}{我想问更多关于利沃斯的事情。}
### {282}{010}{Let's change the subject.}
{282}{010}{让我们换个话题。}
### {283}{019}{I hate such smug and bossy people like you. }
{283}{019}{我讨厌像你这样自鸣得意、专横的人。}
### {284}{999}{I'd better go talk with someone else.}
{284}{999}{我最好去和别人谈谈。}
### {285}{043}{Do you have this attitude toward your relatives too?}
{285}{043}{你对你的亲人也有这种态度吗？}

### {290}{}{The most interesting thing to bother yourself with within Livos is obviously a game of cards. I spend a lot of time playing with my friend Abilene McKinsey. She is a worthy opponent, but more importantly, she always pays her debts. For me, gambling debt is a holy thing. To repay it is a matter of honor, even if my life depends on it.}
{290}{}{在利沃斯，最有趣的事情就是打牌。我花了很多时间和我的朋友阿比琳・麦肯锡一起玩。她是一个有价值的对手，但更重要的是，她总是偿还债务。对我来说，赌债是一件神圣的事情。回报它是一件荣誉的事情，即使我的生命取决于它。}
### {291}{030}{Abilene is your friend?}
{291}{030}{阿比林是你的朋友吗？}
### {292}{036}{Do you mean you could kill yourself if you lose?}
{292}{036}{你是说如果你输了，你会自杀吗？}

### {300}{}{[She makes a short laugh] She means nothing to me. I don't invest my trust in such an unreliable concept as friendship. Abilene is a convenient person. Convenient to play cards with, nothing more. I should point out that her intellectual capabilities are like of a chicken - and this makes her perfect interlocutor, safe to talk with.}
{300}{}{[她笑了笑]她对我来说毫无意义。我不会把信任寄托在友谊这样一个不可靠的概念上。阿比林是个方便的人。打牌很方便，没有别的。我应该指出，她的智力就像一只小鸡――这使她成为完美的对话者，可以安全地交谈。}
### {301}{017}{Tell me more about Livos.}
{301}{017}{告诉我更多关于利沃斯的信息。}
### {302}{010}{I want to ask something else.}
{302}{010}{我想问别的问题。}
### {303}{019}{I knew that you use people for your own benefit. I despise you so much.}
{303}{019}{我知道你利用别人是为了自己的利益。我太鄙视你了。}

### {310}{}{[You see the fire in Emily's eyes] Play a game of cards? A wonderful idea. What are you willing to bet?}
{310}{}{[你看到艾米丽眼里的火了]打牌？好主意。你愿意赌什么？}
### {311}{032}{Let's play all-in! Bet everything we have at the moment!}
{311}{032}{让我们全力以赴！打赌我们现在拥有的一切！}

### {320}{}{[She gives you a cunning smile] I agree with your terms. Shall we begin?}
{320}{}{[她狡猾地笑了笑]我同意你的条件。我们可以开始了吗？}
### {321}{033}{Let's do it!}
{321}{033}{让我们来做吧！}

### {330}{}{[For some time, you play cards with Emily. She is so involved in the process, that fails to notice how you hide a couple of cards in your sleeve, taking out some aces instead. In the end, you easily defeat her. Emily smiles] You won. I am ready to pay my debt. We agreed to play on everything we have. The thing is - I have nothing! I am paying you my debt of nothing! }
{330}{}{[有一段时间，你和Emily一起打牌。她在这个过程中太投入了，以至于没有注意到你是如何把几张牌藏在袖子里的，而是拿出了一些王牌。最后，你轻松击败了她。Emily笑了笑]你赢了。我已经准备好还债了。我们同意利用我们所拥有的一切。问题是――我一无所有！我什么都不欠你！}
### {331}{999}{Uh... Damn, I didn't see that coming. Okay, we'll play again later.}
{331}{999}{嗯该死，我没想到会这样。好的，我们稍后再玩。}
### {332}{034}{What do you mean? I told you, let's bet everything we have at the moment. Your life is what you have!}
{332}{034}{你是什么意思？我告诉过你，让我们把目前的一切都押在赌注上。你的生活就是你所拥有的！}

### {340}{}{[She becomes pale] What?... How?... I... }
{340}{}{[她脸色苍白]什么？。。。怎样我}
### {341}{035}{Yes, Emily, you gambled your life away. Now I can do whatever I want with it.}
{341}{035}{是的，艾米莉，你把自己的生命都赌光了。现在我可以用它做任何我想做的事了。}

### {350}{}{What do I do then?...}
{350}{}{那我该怎么办？。。。}
### {351}{037}{If the word "honor" means anything to you - you'll kill yourself.}
{351}{037}{如果“荣誉”这个词对你有任何意义，你会自杀的。}
### {352}{038}{You will abandon Livos. I give your life to Radius.}
{352}{038}{你会抛弃利沃斯的。我把你的生命交给Radius。}
### {353}{010}{Okay, I am in a good mood today, so I leave your life to yourself. Let's talk about something else.}
{353}{010}{好吧，我今天心情很好，所以我把你的生活留给你自己。让我们谈谈其他事情。}

### {360}{}{[Emily proudly raises her head] If the bet is my life, then I'll do it if I lose! }
{360}{}{[艾米丽骄傲地抬起头]如果赌注是我的命，那么如果我输了，我就赌！}
### {361}{039}{What about the Livos dwellers? What would they think about you killing yourself?}
{361}{039}{利沃什居民呢？他们会怎么看待你自杀？}

### {370}{}{[Emily clenches her teeth, squints, and proudly raises her head] I'll do it. Emily Dunton always pays her debts. Goodbye.}
{370}{}{[艾米丽咬着牙，眯着眼睛，骄傲地抬起头]我会做的。艾米丽・邓顿总是偿还她的债务。再见}

### {390}{}{It is my constitutional right. According to paragraph 6 of our Constitution, "Each inhabitant of the New World has the right to take his own life, if it is not harming the other inhabitants of the New World".}
{390}{}{这是我的宪法权利。根据我国《宪法》第6段，“新世界的每一位居民都有权自杀，如果这不会伤害新世界的其他居民的话”。}
### {391}{010}{What a handy paragraph. Let's talk about something else.}
{391}{010}{多么方便的一段。让我们谈谈其他事情。}

### {400}{}{[She gives a subtle smile] If it can be called an accident. Subtle playing with the highly volatile emotions of people makes wonders, without even involving the culprit in the process. Peter presented a danger for me, so the temper of Boston McKinsey was especially appropriate. My role in this incident went totally unnoticed. Why am I saying this to you? The thing is, even if you would tell someone, nobody would take your words for the truth. }
{400}{}{[她微微一笑]如果可以称之为意外的话。微妙地处理人们高度波动的情绪会产生奇迹，甚至不会让罪魁祸首参与其中。彼得给我带来了危险，所以波士顿麦肯锡的脾气特别合适。我在这起事件中的角色完全没有被注意到。我为什么对你这么说？问题是，即使你会告诉别人，也没有人会相信你的话是真实的。}
### {401}{019}{So this is your doing? You cold-hearted bitch!}
{401}{019}{这是你干的吗？你这个冷血的婊子！}

### {403}{041}{I suggest holding a commemorative evening dedicated to Peter Horton.}
{403}{041}{我建议举办一个纪念彼得・霍顿的晚会。}

### {410}{}{Why would I want to do that? Claudia Horton spends all her energy on Boston McKinsey, who always remains in stress because of that. And none one of them takes interest in matters of leading the vault.}
{410}{}{我为什么要这么做？克劳迪娅・霍顿（Claudia Horton）把所有的精力都花在了波士顿麦肯锡（Boston McKinsey）身上，因为这一点，麦肯锡一直处于压力之中。他们中没有一个人对领导金库的事情感兴趣。}
### {411}{010}{[You think for a really long time, but fail to find a good argument] I don't even know... Okay, let's talk about something else.}
{411}{010}{[你想了很长时间，但没有找到一个好的论据]我甚至不知道。。。好吧，让我们谈谈其他事情。}
### {412}{042}{If the situation will keep going like this, it could lead to a point where the Horton family will fall apart. Claudia is very close to crossing the line.}
{412}{042}{如果这种情况继续下去，霍顿家族可能会分崩离析。克劳迪娅几乎要越界了。}

### {420}{}{[Emily hesitates] ...Actually, you might be right, her delusion is going too far. Her actions could lead to a disbalance of social powers in Livos. I will hold the commemorative evening, so Claudia would find some serenity.}
{420}{}{[艾米丽犹豫了一下]。。。事实上，你可能是对的，她的妄想太过分了。她的行为可能导致利沃斯社会权力的失衡。我将举办纪念晚会，这样克劳迪娅就能找到一些宁静。}
### {421}{999}{Great. I'll go tell her the good news.}
{421}{999}{太棒了我去告诉她这个好消息。}

### {430}{}{They are just worthless worms, just as everybody else. Especially Soup, who is my husband. I married him only because of his social status, and I never let this filth approach me. Even to think about physical intimacy with Soup makes me so sick I have an urge to vomit. }
{430}{}{他们和其他人一样，都是毫无价值的蠕虫。特别是汤，他是我的丈夫。我嫁给他只是因为他的社会地位，我从来没有让这种肮脏接近过我。甚至一想到与汤的身体亲密关系，我就恶心得想吐。}
### {431}{010}{Now I see why you have no children. Let's talk about something else.}
{431}{010}{现在我明白你为什么没有孩子了。让我们谈谈其他事情。}

### {440}{}{What? This worthless worm decided that he could take my position? I thank you for this information. I'll deal with this matter.}
{440}{}{什么这个毫无价值的蠕虫决定他可以接替我的位置？我感谢你提供的信息。我来处理这件事。}
### {441}{010}{I see. I want to ask something else.}
{441}{010}{我明白了。我想问别的问题。}

### {450}{}{I figured that literally not one important event can happen without me here. Lead the way!}

### {451}{999}{Yes, come on...}
{451}{999}{是的，来吧。。。}

### {460}{}{What was the reason that you brought me here? I see nothing extraordinary around the filter room.}
{460}{}{你带我来这里的原因是什么？我在过滤室周围看不到什么特别的东西。}
### {461}{998}{I got you here to finally deal with you! Death to a tyrant!}
{461}{998}{我让你来这里是为了最终对付你！暴君死定了！}
### {462}{999}{I was probably mistaken. Everything is alright here, let's go back.}
{462}{999}{我可能错了。这里一切都好，我们回去吧。}

### {470}{}{I am carefully listening.}
{470}{}{我正在认真地听着。}
### {471}{044}{I had a talk with your husband, Soup. He wants you dead.}
{471}{044}{汤，我和你丈夫谈过了。他想让你死。}
### {472}{045}{Emily! We urgently need your presence in the filter room! No one is going to do a thing without you managing!}
{472}{045}{艾米莉！我们迫切需要您光临过滤室！没有你的管理，任何人都不会做任何事情！}
### {473}{010}{Actually, I wanted to ask a question.}
{473}{010}{事实上，我想问一个问题。}
### {474}{999}{Although, not now. I need to go.}
{474}{999}{虽然，不是现在。我得走了。}
