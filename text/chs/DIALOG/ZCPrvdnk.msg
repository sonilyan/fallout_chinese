#{122}{}{I used to transport moonshine for one of the local brewers, but business is dangerous in Reno. His competitor smashed his stills and broke his legs. I thought I could make a profit at the casino - and lost everything. Now I'm trying to figure out what to do next. There's not a lot of options.}
