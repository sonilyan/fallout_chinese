#The first dialog
### {200}{}{? How are you... For God's sake, you shouldn't have taken that risk! We would have been able to find salvation... But of course, I'm glad to see you. And how proud your padre would be if he learned about the feat of his child! You're doing great.}
{200}{}{？你好吗看在上帝的份上，你不应该冒这个险！我们本可以找到救赎。。。当然，我很高兴见到你。如果你的牧师知道他孩子的壮举，他会多么自豪！你做得很好。}
### {201}{}{It's disgusting to listen to you, Madre. I'm old enough to make decisions.}
{201}{}{听你说话真恶心，马德尔。我已经足够大了，可以做决定了。}
### {1201}{}{It's disgusting to listen to you, Madre. I'm old enough to make decisions.}
{1201}{}{听你说话真恶心，马德尔。我已经足够大了，可以做决定了。}
### {202}{}{I would not forgive myself if something happened to you because of my inaction.}
{202}{}{如果你因为我的不作为而出事，我不会原谅自己。}
### {1202}{}{I wouldn't forgive myself if something happened to you because of my inaction.}
{1202}{}{如果你因为我的不作为而出事，我不会原谅自己。}
### {203}{}{Oh, yes, of course... I understand. Perhaps it's all about this raid. He changed something in all of us. I see changes in your eyes, I see a slightly different person. And I don't know if it's good or not.}
{203}{}{哦，是的，当然。。。我理解。也许这一切都与这次突袭有关。他改变了我们所有人的一些东西。我从你的眼睛里看到了变化，我看到了一个稍微不同的人。我不知道它是好是坏。}
### {204}{}{Well, that's the strength of our whole Villa - we're all like one big family. Everyone is responsible for each other. And I am glad to see that the journey has not changed these ideals in you.}
{204}{}{好吧，这就是我们整个别墅的力量――我们就像一个大家庭。每个人都对彼此负责。我很高兴看到这段旅程并没有改变你们的这些理想。}
### {205}{}{Now let's think about how we can get out of this mess.}
{205}{}{现在让我们思考一下如何摆脱这场混乱。}

### {206}{}{I'm afraid it won't be easy. As you can see, there are only three of our people in the pen. Two more were lost in the mines. The rest, including your padre, were taken south to the big city of Phoenix.}
{206}{}{恐怕这并不容易。正如你所看到的，我们只有三个人在围栏里。另有两人在矿井中丧生。其他人，包括你的牧师，被带到南方的大城市凤凰城。}
### {207}{}{What were these mercenaries doing to you?}
{207}{}{这些雇佣兵对你做了什么？}
### {208}{}{How do I get to Phoenix?}
{208}{}{我怎么去凤凰城？}
### {209}{}{What do you know about the lost group?}
{209}{}{你对失联小组了解多少？}
### {210}{}{How can I free you from this pen?}
{210}{}{我怎样才能把你从这支笔里拿出来？}
### {211}{}{I will try to solve these problems. Wait for the signal.}
{211}{}{我会设法解决这些问题。等待信号。}
### {212}{}{Nice to see you.}
{212}{}{很高兴见到你。}
### {213}{}{I'm still working on your release. Wait.}
{213}{}{我还在为你的获释做准备。等待}
### {214}{}{Yes?}
{214}{}{对}
### {215}{}{Bye.}
{215}{}{再见}
### {216}{}{I see.}
{216}{}{我明白了。}
### {217}{}{Nothing special, don't worry. Basically, I was doing the same household chores as at the Villa. Only bigger and heavier. These colonists are so ill-mannered. But men are forced to work in the mines. It's really hard for them.}
{217}{}{没什么特别的，别担心。基本上，我做的家务和在别墅里做的一样。只是更大更重。这些殖民者太没礼貌了。但是男人们被迫在矿井里工作。这对他们来说真的很难。}
### {218}{}{They say it's a big city in the south, but I've never been there. Trade caravans travel between Flagstaff and Phoenix. Ask the locals, they should know something about it.}
{218}{}{他们说这是南方的一个大城市，但我从来没有去过那里。贸易商队来往于弗拉格斯塔夫和菲尼克斯之间。问问当地人，他们应该对此有所了解。}
### {219}{}{Hugo and Sancho went into the mines to find a secret passage. Since then, there has been no news from them.}
{219}{}{雨果和桑乔进入矿井寻找一条秘密通道。从那以后，他们再也没有任何消息。}
### {220}{}{The colonists won't let us go voluntarily. You can talk to their boss, but he is unlikely to make concessions without serious benefits.}
{220}{}{殖民者不会让我们自愿离开的。你可以和他们的老板谈谈，但如果没有重大利益，他不太可能做出让步。}
### {221}{}{How about an escape?}
{221}{}{逃跑怎么样？}
### {222}{}{We would have run a long time ago if it weren't for these collars. They'll kill us instantly if we get too far from the camp. They say that they are controlled by that big antenna opposite the pen, but none of the prisoners understands this.}
{222}{}{如果不是这些项圈，我们早就跑了。如果我们离营地太远，他们会立刻杀了我们。他们说他们被围栏对面的大天线控制着，但没有一个囚犯理解这一点。}
### {223}{}{You don't want to let me go there, do you?}
{223}{}{你不想让我去那里，是吗？}
### {224}{}{It's not even about the dangers of traveling, but about the city itself. They tell a lot about him, but nothing good. Besides, your uncle Miguel once went with a caravan to Phoenix and never came back. Try to find him, maybe he will help.}
{224}{}{这甚至与旅行的危险无关，而是与城市本身有关。他们说了很多关于他的事，但没有什么好的。此外，你的叔叔米格尔曾经和一个大篷车去凤凰城，再也没有回来。试着找到他，也许他会帮上忙。}
### {225}{}{Faber gave you freedom. It's time to go back to the Villa.}
{225}{}{费伯给了你自由。是时候回别墅了。}
### {226}{}{We are free! Don't worry about us, we'll get to the Villa on our own. But you need to help your padre soon, he was sent to the south. Good luck.}
{226}{}{我们自由了！别担心我们，我们会自己去别墅的。但你需要尽快帮助你的牧师，他被派往南方。祝你好运}
### {227}{}{See you at the Villa.}
{227}{}{别墅见。}
### {228}{}{The guards are dead, you can leave.}
{228}{}{警卫已经死了，你可以离开。}
### {229}{}{Collars are no longer dangerous. Take them off and get out of here.}
{229}{}{项圈不再危险。把它们摘下来，离开这里。}
### {230}{}{That's good, but how do we get past the guards?}
{230}{}{这很好，但我们如何越过警卫？}
### {231}{}{This problem has yet to be considered.}
{231}{}{这个问题还有待考虑。}
### {232}{}{Leave the guards to me. I'll get you out of here.}
{232}{}{把警卫交给我，我带你离开这里。}
### {233}{}{Do you really know what to do? As soon as we leave the pen, the guards will attack us. We won't be able to resist so many armed people.}
{233}{}{你真的知道该怎么办吗？我们一离开围栏，警卫就会攻击我们。我们将无法抵抗这么多武装人员。}
### {234}{}{Don't mind the guards, I know what I'm doing.}
{234}{}{别介意警卫，我知道我在做什么。}
### {235}{}{Stay in the pen until I give the command.}
{235}{}{待在围栏里直到我发出命令。}
### {236}{}{OK. Lead us. As soon as we get out of the garrison, then we'll talk.}
{236}{}{好的，带领我们。我们一离开驻军，我们就谈谈。}
### {237}{}{Let's go.}
{237}{}{我们走吧。}
### {238}{}{It's a bad thing. I can't get you out alone. Who could help us?}
{238}{}{这是一件坏事。我不能单独带你出去。谁能帮助我们？}
### {239}{}{The only ones who can help us are the Rangers. They live south of the Villa on the Colorado River. But don't rush to fall at their feet. Rangers offer their protection for a reason.}
{239}{}{唯一能帮助我们的是流浪者队。他们住在科罗拉多河上的别墅以南。但不要急着摔倒在他们脚下。游骑兵提供保护是有原因的。}
### {240}{}{What about escape?}
{240}{}{逃跑怎么办？}
