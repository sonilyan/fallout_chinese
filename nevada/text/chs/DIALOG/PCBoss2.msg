#{100}{}{You see a farmer.}
{100}{}{你看到一个农夫。}
#{101}{}{You see a respected resident of Bridgeport, the head of a family.}
{101}{}{你看到一个受人尊敬的布里奇波特居民，一个家族的首领。}
#{102}{}{}
{102}{}{}
#{103}{}{Another step, and you'll get a taste of my pitchfork!}
{103}{}{再走一步，你就会尝到我的干草叉！}
#{104}{}{I am a peaceful farmer, I'm not going to talk to you like this. Put your weapon away!}
{104}{}{我是个平和的农民，我不会这样跟你说话。把你的武器收起来！}
#{110}{}{What do you want?}
{110}{}{你想要什么？}
#{111}{}{Nothing, relax.}
{111}{}{没事，放松。}
#{112}{}{I am interested in this village. Tell me the history of this place.}
{112}{}{我对这个村子很感兴趣。告诉我这个地方的历史。}
#{113}{}{Well, it17s very short and boring story. Bridgeport was uninhabited since the time of war, until our families settled here about six years ago. We are all from Reno, left when living there became really bad and the only option was to move away. Then we came across this wonderful place and decided to stay.}
{113}{}{嗯，这是一个很短很无聊的故事。从战争时期起，布里奇波特就一直无人居住，直到六年前我们的家人在这里定居。我们都是里诺人，离开的时候，那里的生活变得非常糟糕，唯一的选择就是搬走。后来我们遇到了这个好地方，决定留下来。}
#{114}{}{Go on.}
{114}{}{继续。}
#{115}{}{We repaired the houses, cultivated the crops, even bred our own stock - and just started living. Honestly, it's a lot better than in big Reno. Though, we sometimes miss the luxuries of the city. For example, so far we were unable to fully restore the electricity in Bridgeport, sometimes we need medication and also, our houses are deteriorating.}
{115}{}{我们修了房子，种了庄稼，甚至养了自己的家畜――然后才开始生活。老实说，这比在大雷诺好多了。不过，我们有时会怀念城市的奢华。例如，到目前为止，我们无法完全恢复布里奇波特的电力，有时我们需要药物治疗，而且，我们的房子正在恶化。}
#{116}{}{If you want, I can bring you something from Reno.}
{116}{}{如果你愿意，我可以从雷诺给你带点东西。}
#{117}{}{How do you manage to feed yourselves here?}
{117}{}{你怎么能在这里养活自己？}
#{118}{}{It's pretty cold in here.}
{118}{}{这里很冷。}
#{119}{}{Are you alone in these parts?}
{119}{}{这些地方只有你一个人吗？}
#{120}{}{This is interesting, but let17s change the subject.}
{120}{}{这很有趣，但我们换个话题吧。}
#{121}{}{Thanks, that will be enough.}
{121}{}{谢谢，那就够了。}
#{130}{}{}
{130}{}{}
#{131}{}{At first we lived on pre-war food stocks, which were well-preserved, thanks to the cold climate. It17s all gone now, the local stores are looted. But in the meantime we learned to grow crops and breed brahmin. Sometimes Jacob brings something from the hunt. Everyone is contributing in any way they can.}
{131}{}{起初我们靠战前的粮食储备生活，由于气候寒冷，这些储备保存得很好。现在都不见了，当地的商店被洗劫一空。但与此同时，我们学会了种植庄稼和培育婆罗门。有时雅各布会从狩猎中带来一些东西。每个人都在尽其所能做出贡献。}
#{132}{}{Yes, but fortunately we have brahmin hides. They provide better protection from the cold than the pre-war clothes, and even more so - than the skins of these giant lizards. Judging from old photographs, there were ski resorts here, with entire mountains completely covered with snow. The climate has probably changed a lot, because we have never seen such a large amount of snow in our lives. But, instead of the snow, we now have clean water that fills the lakes, in which fish are found. In any case, the cold mountains are better than the hot deserts of Nevada.}
{132}{}{是的，但幸运的是我们有婆罗门的兽皮。它们比战前的衣服更能抵御寒冷，甚至比这些巨型蜥蜴的皮肤更能抵御寒冷。从老照片上看，这里有滑雪胜地，整座山都被雪覆盖着。气候可能已经改变了很多，因为我们从来没有见过这么大的雪在我们的生活。但是，我们现在有了干净的水，而不是雪，充满了湖泊，在那里可以找到鱼。无论如何，寒冷的山脉比内华达州炎热的沙漠要好。}
#{133}{}{Wilderness, we rarely have travelers here. I have heard of a tribe of savages in the mountains to the south. If you are interested, talk to our prospector Jacob about it.}
{133}{}{荒野，我们这里很少有旅行者。我听说南部山区有一个野蛮人部落。如果你有兴趣，和我们的勘探者雅各布谈谈。}
#{134}{}{}
{134}{}{}
#{135}{}{You said something about problems with the electricity?}
{135}{}{你说电力有问题？}
#{136}{}{You mentioned needing medication. Is someone sick in your community?}
{136}{}{你提到需要药物治疗。你们社区有人生病吗？}
#{137}{}{If the community needs supplies, then why don17t you establish a trade route with other settlements?}
{137}{}{如果社区需要物资，那你为什么不与其他定居点建立一条贸易路线呢？}
#{138}{}{There is none. Jacob tried to run a generator to light the streets and houses, but so far there haven't been any results.}
{138}{}{没有。雅各布试图用发电机照亮街道和房屋，但至今没有任何结果。}
#{139}{}{Maybe I can help?}
{139}{}{也许我能帮忙？}
#{140}{}{That would be great. Talk to Jacob about it.}
{140}{}{那太好了。和雅各布谈谈。}
#{141}{}{Okay.}
{141}{}{可以。}
#{142}{}{Let17s talk about something else.}
{142}{}{我们再谈点别的吧。}
#{143}{}{That17s not interesting. Bye.}
{143}{}{那不有趣。再见。}
#{144}{}{I'll talk to him later, tell me something else please.}
{144}{}{我晚点再跟他谈，请告诉我别的事。}
#{145}{}{My daughter needs help. Are you a doctor? It would be a great luck if there were a doctor or at least a standard first aid kit, to help fight the fever.}
{145}{}{我女儿需要帮助。你是医生吗？如果有医生或者至少有一个标准的急救箱来帮助对抗发烧，那将是一个巨大的幸运。}
#{146}{}{I have some experience as a doctor. Will you allow me to examine the patient?}
{146}{}{我有一些当医生的经验。请允许我给病人检查一下好吗？}
#{147}{}{You17re in luck - I have a first aid kit.}
{147}{}{你真走运-我有急救箱。}
#{148}{}{You17re in luck - I have a doctors bag.}
{148}{}{你真走运-我有个医生包。}
#{149}{}{Sure, I'll be glad to help!}
{149}{}{当然，我很乐意帮忙！}
#{150}{}{I17ll take a look later, for now tell me something else.}
{150}{}{我一会儿再看，现在告诉我别的。}
#{151}{}{I'll go do my job then.}
{151}{}{那我就去做我的工作。}
#{152}{}{Thank you! It will help not only my daughter, but everyone. In these conditions there are always some health problems.}
{152}{}{谢谢您！这不仅对我女儿有帮助，而且对每个人都有帮助。在这种情况下，总有一些健康问题。}
#{153}{}{You17re welcome.}
{153}{}{不客气。}
#{154}{}{Your daughter is fine now.}
{154}{}{你女儿现在很好。}
#{155}{}{Thank you! You have brought joy to our house. We don17t forget something like this around here.}
{155}{}{谢谢您！你给我们家带来了欢乐。我们不会忘记这附近的事情。}
#{156}{}{Take care.}
{156}{}{当心。}
#{157}{}{Don17t you dare touching my daughter! I can feel something repulsive about you.}
{157}{}{你敢碰我女儿！我能感觉到你有点讨厌。}
#{158}{}{Well, I do have a special relationship with children, so you17re right about that...}
{158}{}{嗯，我确实和孩子们有着特殊的关系，所以你说得对。。。}
#{159}{}{}
{159}{}{}
#{160}{}{I thought about it, but we are so far away from major settlements that we can17t contact anyone to offer trade. Sometimes we really need it - for example, medicines and equipment are always appreciated.}
{160}{}{我想了想，但是我们离主要的定居点太远了，我们不能联系任何人来提供贸易。有时我们真的需要它-例如，药品和设备总是受到赞赏。}
#{161}{}{If I ever get to the big city I will convey your offer to the caravan merchants.}
{161}{}{如果我到了大城市，我会把你的提议转达给商队的商人。}
#{162}{}{That17s not my kind of problem. Let17s talk about something else.}
{162}{}{那不是我的问题。我们再谈点别的吧。}
#{163}{}{Not interested. Bye.}
{163}{}{不感兴趣。再见。}
#{164}{}{Really good idea. I will make a list of things that we need. We can trade a small amount of food, clean water and hides. Tell that to the caravan merchants, please.}
{164}{}{好主意。我会列出我们需要的东西。我们可以交易少量的食物、干净的水和兽皮。请告诉商队的商人。}
#{165}{}{Okay, but that17s not everything I wanted to know about.}
{165}{}{好吧，但这不是我想知道的全部。}
#{166}{}{No problem. I'll go right now.}
{166}{}{没问题。我现在就去。}
#{167}{}{Regarding the patient - here's a first aid kit, treat her yourself.}
{167}{}{关于病人-这是急救箱，你自己给她治疗。}
#{168}{}{Regarding the patient - here is a doctors bag, treat her yourself.}
{168}{}{关于病人-这是一个医生包，你自己给她治疗。}
#{169}{}{}
{169}{}{}
#{170}{}{You're talking about the shortage of urban comforts. Is your child in need of something too?}
{170}{}{你说的是城市舒适设施的短缺。你的孩子也需要什么吗？}
#{171}{}{Here, take a Nuka-Cola for your daughter. It17s a gift.}
{171}{}{给，给你女儿拿一杯努卡可乐。这是一份礼物。}
#{172}{}{We provide her with everything she needs, but... Before the war, she used to like Nuka-Cola. But local stocks ran out a long time ago, and there is nowhere to get more.}
{172}{}{我们提供她所需要的一切，但是。。。战前，她喜欢努卡可乐。但本地股市早已告罄，无处可寻。}
#{173}{}{Bringing a tenth Nuka-Cola bottle, you have earned a better reputation from local residents.}
{173}{}{带着第十瓶努卡可乐，你在当地居民中赢得了更好的声誉。}
#{174}{}{Gift? Well, thanks. Such care for children is a rare thing these days.}
{174}{}{礼物？好吧，谢谢。现在这样照顾孩子是很少见的事。}
#{175}{}{You are always welcome.}
{175}{}{欢迎您再来。}
#{176}{}{We don17t need anything from you. You better get out of here, while your still breathing.}
{176}{}{我们不需要你的任何东西。你最好离开这里，趁你还有呼吸。}
#{177}{}{Perhaps you guessed my special relationship with children...}
{177}{}{也许你猜到了我和孩子的特殊关系。。。}
#{178}{}{Apparently, the locals have too low opinion of me...}
{178}{}{显然，当地人对我的评价太低了。。。}
#{180}{}{What is it? Did you manage to repair the power grid? Terrific! Thank you so much. Now life here will be much easier, especially in the cold winter. Here, take some fruit from the plate, help yourself. As soon we get electric oven going, the first thing I'll ask my wife is to cook an apple pie.}
{180}{}{它是什么？你修好电网了吗？极好的！非常感谢。现在这里的生活会轻松得多，特别是在寒冷的冬天。来，从盘子里拿些水果，随便吃。电烤箱一开动，我就叫我妻子做个苹果派。}
#{181}{}{You are always welcome.}
{181}{}{欢迎您再来。}
#{182}{}{What is that smell?}
{182}{}{那是什么味道？}
#{183}{}{As I said, my wife cooked an apple pie. You deserve a little too, for your good deeds.}
{183}{}{正如我所说，我妻子做了一个苹果派。你的善行也值得一点。}
#{184}{}{Thanks.}
{184}{}{谢谢。}
#{190}{}{Tell me about the bikers.}
{190}{}{告诉我关于摩托车手的事。}
#{191}{}{We didn't call them here. In the past bikers sometimes came to us, but never so many. They seem somewhat anxious, as if they are waiting for something. I don't know what. But our family is already tired of these guys. It would be better for us all if they leave soon.}
{191}{}{我们没叫他们来。过去，骑自行车的人有时会来找我们，但从来没有这么多。他们似乎有些焦虑，好像在等什么。我不知道是什么。但我们家已经厌倦了这些家伙。如果他们早点离开，对我们大家都好。}
#{192}{}{Okay.}
{192}{}{可以。}
