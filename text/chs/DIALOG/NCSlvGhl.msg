#{100}{}{You see a ghoul.}
{100}{}{你看到一个食尸鬼。}
#{101}{}{You see a mutated sewer dweller.}
{101}{}{你看到一个变异的下水道居民。}
#{110}{}{What? A person?! Are you real? You can't be real... [he reaches out with both hands, shuffling towards you]}
{110}{}{什么？一个人？！你是真的吗？你不可能是真的。。。[他伸出双手，拖着脚步走向你]}
#{111}{}{Calm down, I'm definitely real. I think.}
{111}{}{冷静点，我绝对是真的。我想。}
#{112}{}{Hands off, zombie! Don't you dare touch me!}
{112}{}{放开手，僵尸！你敢碰我！}
#{113}{}{You... [he puts his hands gently on your chest] ...You're real! [he suddenly jumps back, as if his hands were scalded with boiling water] Ahh! Oh my god! When was... How long has it been since I saw a real person?!}
{113}{}{你。。。[他把手轻轻放在你胸前]…你是真的！[他突然往后一跳，好像手被开水烫了]啊！哦，我的上帝！什么时候。。。我多久没见到真人了？！}
#{114}{}{Calm down, I won't hurt you.}
{114}{}{冷静点，我不会伤害你的。}
#{115}{}{That's right, mutant! Fear me!}
{115}{}{没错，变种人！怕我！}
#{116}{}{[He jumps back, holding his hands to his chest] No, don't! I just... I just wanted to make sure I wasn't imagining you. It's been so long... Oh my god, how long has it been?!}
{116}{}{[他向后跳，双手放在胸前]不，不要！我只是。。。我只是想确定我不是在想象你。已经很久了。。。天哪，有多久了？！}
#{117}{}{Calm down, I won't hurt you.}
{117}{}{冷静点，我不会伤害你的。}
#{118}{}{That's right, mutant! Fear me!}
{118}{}{没错，变种人！怕我！}
#{119}{}{But... [he looks around wildly, almost suspiciously] ...But how are you here?! I've never found a way out, and I've been here ten years... Or was it twenty? Without the sun, I can't tell one day from the next...}
{119}{}{但是。。。[他疯狂地，几乎怀疑地环顾四周]…但你在这里怎么样？！我从来没有找到出路，我在这里已经十年了。。。还是二十岁？没有太阳，我无法分辨一天和下一天。。。}
#{120}{}{Yeah, yeah, you've been here a long time. I get it. Can we move on?}
{120}{}{是的，是的，你在这里已经很久了。我明白了。我们能继续吗？}
#{121}{}{Oh, right... Yes... Please, tell me, how do I get out?}
{121}{}{哦，对了。。。对。。。拜托，告诉我，我怎么出去？}
#{122}{}{Same way I got in. I left a rope leading back up to the street.}
{122}{}{我也是这样进去的。我留下一根绳子引到街上去。}
#{123}{}{Just think, moron. There's not a lot of space to move around down here. I'm sure you'll figure it out.}
{123}{}{想想看，白痴。这里没有足够的空间移动。我相信你会明白的。}
#{124}{}{Oh, right, right. Finally... Ten years, twenty years? And now... [he hugs himself, looking scared at the thought of leaving]}
{124}{}{哦，对，对。最后。。。十年，二十年？现在。。。[他拥抱着自己，一想到要离开就显得很害怕]}
#{125}{}{How did you end up down here, anyway?}
{125}{}{你怎么会到这里来的？}
#{126}{}{It was so long ago. It's hard to remember...}
{126}{}{那是很久以前的事了。很难记住。。。}
#{127}{}{You again! I'm so glad to see you!}
{127}{}{又是你！很高兴见到你！}
#{130}{}{What's your name?}
{130}{}{你叫什么名字？}
#{131}{}{How did you get here?}
{131}{}{你怎么来的？}
#{132}{}{What happened to your skin?}
{132}{}{你的皮肤怎么了？}
#{133}{}{Where did you live before you end up here?}
{133}{}{你在这之前住在哪里？}
#{134}{}{Have you tried to get back to the surface?}
{134}{}{你试过回到水面吗？}
#{135}{}{So are you going to leave?}
{135}{}{你要走了吗？}
#{136}{}{}
{136}{}{}
#{137}{}{}
{137}{}{}
#{138}{}{}
{138}{}{}
#{139}{}{Stay here, I need go somewhere.}
{139}{}{呆在这儿，我要去别的地方。}
#{140}{}{It's... Cruz, I think. No, Crusoe. Or something like that...}
{140}{}{这是。。。克鲁兹，我想。不，克鲁索。或者类似的。。。}
#{141}{}{Colin. It was Colin. We'd been drinking and were walking home late at night. Then, he stopped, grabbed me by the shoulders, and... And he tossed me into the sewer hole, saying Shelley would be his! That bastard, I thought we were friends! Friends... Oh, when I had friends...}
{141}{}{科林。是科林。我们一直在喝酒，深夜步行回家。然后，他停下来，抓住我的肩膀，然后。。。他把我扔进下水道，说雪莱是他的！那个混蛋，我以为我们是朋友！朋友。。。哦，当我有朋友的时候。。。}
#{142}{}{My skin? [he looks down at himself] Oh... Right... It wasn't always like this, was it? It was soft, like yours... When did this happen? It was itchy when I first got down here. Then it was hard to breathe, and I got so sick... But that was a long, long time ago.}
{142}{}{我的皮肤？[他低头看着自己]哦。。。正确的。。。不是一直都是这样的，是吗？它很柔软，就像你的。。。什么时候发生的？我刚下来的时候很痒。然后呼吸困难，我病得很厉害。。。但那是很久很久以前的事了。}
#{143}{}{Above. Right above... Almost, I think. I hear wheels above sometimes... I think a lot of caravans come through here. And my house was close to the restaurant. Ah, my home... What does it look like now? Is Shelley still there? Is... Is Colin...}
{143}{}{上面。就在上面。。。差不多了，我想。我有时听到上面有轮子。。。我想有很多商队从这里经过。我家离餐馆很近。啊，我的家。。。现在是什么样子？雪莱还在吗？是。。。科林。。。}
#{144}{}{Did I try? Oh, did I try! But the hole I used to get in - it had no ladder, no rope. I tried so hard to climb the wall, but even if I could, how could I open the lid? And so long I tried to squeeze between the bars, but I couldn't. The rats could... So I ate them. That's how I've lived, for years... Sometimes I tried to scream for help, but no one heard me.}
{144}{}{我试过了吗？哦，我试过了！但我过去常钻的洞没有梯子，没有绳子。我很努力地想爬墙，但即使我能，我怎么能打开盖子呢？我一直想挤在栅栏之间，但我做不到。老鼠可以。。。所以我吃了。我就是这样生活的，多年来。。。有时我想大声呼救，但没人听见。}
#{145}{}{I... I don't know... I'm afraid. It's been so long, I've missed so much... My face, I'm afraid when I see myself in the water. What if they beat me, like those half-wits from the uranium mines? And Shelley! No, Shelley can't know what I'm like now. She must think I died. If she saw me... No, I can't leave now. I'll... I'll come up with something. Somehow.}
{145}{}{一、 。。。我不知道。。。我很害怕。太久了，我错过了太多。。。我的脸，我害怕当我看到自己在水里。如果他们打了我，像那些从铀矿来的笨蛋？还有雪莱！不，雪莱不知道我现在是什么样子。她一定以为我死了。如果她看到我。。。不，我现在不能走。我会。。。我会想出办法的。不知怎么的。}
#{146}{}{Do you want me to talk to Shelley for you?}
{146}{}{你要我帮你和雪莱谈谈吗？}
#{147}{}{Would... Would you do that? For me? [he puts a hand to his mouth, eyes bugging out in intense thought] Be careful, okay? Don't talk to Colin, if he's still there.}
{147}{}{会。。。你会那样做吗？为了我？[他把一只手放在嘴上，眼睛在紧张地想]小心点，好吗？别跟科林说话，如果他还在的话。}
#{148}{}{Okay, wait here. I'll bring back news.}
{148}{}{好的，在这里等着。我会带回消息的。}
#{149}{}{}
{149}{}{}
#{150}{}{Shelley is too beautiful for these sewers, too beautiful for me... And yet she's here. Thank you again.}
{150}{}{雪莱对这些下水道来说太美了，对我来说太美了。。。但她却在这里。再次感谢你。}
#{151}{}{WHY?! After all this, everything was as it was before, and now...}
{151}{}{为什么？在这一切之后，一切都和以前一样，现在。。。}
#{152}{}{I'm so happy to see you! Shelley and I are together again, like nothing ever happened. Even like this, she remembers me. Even like this, she loves me! What did I ever do to deserve such a wonderful, perfect woman?}
{152}{}{很高兴见到你！雪莱和我又在一起了，就像什么都没发生过一样。即使这样，她仍然记得我。即使这样，她也爱我！我做过什么，配得上这样一个完美的女人？}
#{153}{}{I'm glad everything turned out well. Good luck, both of you.}
{153}{}{我很高兴一切顺利。祝你们好运。}
#{154}{}{Yeesh, I'm going to be sick. Good thing I'm in a sewer.}
{154}{}{是的，我要生病了。幸好我在下水道里。}
#{155}{}{Wait, before you go... Take this lighter. I think someone dropped it down the drain. It's all I have to give you. Thank you again. I'll always be grateful to you.}
{155}{}{等等，在你走之前。。。拿着这个打火机。我想是有人把它掉进下水道了。这就是我要给你的一切。再次感谢你。我将永远感激你。}
#{156}{}{Thank you. I'll find a good use for it.}
{156}{}{非常感谢。我会好好利用它的。}
#{157}{}{You're giving me something from the sewer? Eww...}
{157}{}{你在给我下水道里的东西？哎呀。。。}
#{1111}{}{Calm down, I'm definitely real. I think.}
{1111}{}{冷静点，我绝对是真的。我想。}
#{1113}{}{You... [he puts his hands gently on your chest] ...You're real! [he suddenly jumps back, as if his hands were scalded with boiling water] Ahh! Oh my god! When was... How long has it been since I saw a real person?!}
{1113}{}{你。。。[他把手轻轻放在你胸前]…你是真的！[他突然往后一跳，好像手被开水烫了]啊！哦，我的上帝！什么时候。。。我多久没见到真人了？！}
#{1119}{}{But... [he looks around wildly, almost suspiciously] ...But how are you here?! I've never found a way out, and I've been here ten years... Or was it twenty? Without the sun, I can't tell one day from the next...}
