{100}{}{You see: Jack.}
{101}{}{It's Jack. The local drug-store owner.}
#
{102}{}{Hey there stranger. Didn't see ya before. Wanna take a look at my range of medical supplies.}
{103}{}{Sure.}
{104}{}{Later.}
#
{105}{}{Pleasure doing business with you.}
{106}{}{Bye.}
#
{107}{}{Hello again. Can Jack offer you some of his goods?}
{108}{}{Show me me what you've got.}
{109}{}{Nothing now.}
#option for reward 135
{110}{}{Do you have any heart pills in stock?}
#
{111}{}{I'm sorry to tell you, but a few days ago I was robbed. They took my money, the medical supplies I'd just
 bought, everything... I even had the pills you want, but they took those, too! And there won't be any more shipments
 neither, and even if, I don't have the money to resupply. Damn shame those bastards robbed me...}
{112}{}{Is there any way I could find who robbed you?}
{113}{}{I'm sorry to hear it. Guess I'm gonna try somewhere else then.} #quest cancel
#
{114}{}{I really don't know who robbed me. The first time I saw them was when they broke into my store swinging
 their guns around! I was so scared I hid under the table... When I got up, there was only a big mess left, some of my
 furniture is still broken. [He looks around.] Well, I s'pose it can't hurt to try and find those guys. Know what, if you
 return my stolen goods, I'll give you something in return.}
#
{115}{}{OK. Tell me what you know.}
{116}{}{Right! I'm gonna question some people, and then I'm gonna shoot some. [You leave.]} #quest cancel
{117}{}{Nah, that's not really my concern. I'll try somewhere else.} #quest cancel
#
{118}{}{Let me see... There were three of them if I recall correctly. I didn't really see their faces but they were wearing
 purple robes. That's all I can tell.}
#
{119}{}{OK. If I find out something, you'll be the first to know. }
{120}{}{What did they steal exactly?}
#
{121}{}{They stole $2000, five stimpaks, two mentats, two heart pills and... Yes, one antidote flask.}
#
{122}{}{Alright, that should be enough. I'm off to find them.}
#
{123}{}{You're back. Did you find those bastards who robbed me?}
#
{124}{}{I'm still looking for them.}
{125}{}{Yes, I recovered your supplies. And those robbers are never gonna come back again.}
#
{126}{}{I don't wanna know how you did it, but I want to thank you. Here's some money and medical supplies for you.
 [Hands you $2000 and 2 Stimpaks.] And, you told me Karl needs some heart pills? [Hands you two boxes.] I think this
 will do. Thank you again and stop by anytime! [He smiles at you.]}
{127}{}{Thanks, I was glad to help.}
#
{128}{}{I'm busy at the moment.}
{129}{}{I was robbed, remember!?}
{130}{}{No, no, you just stay away from my store.}
{131}{}{Don't you have anything better to do!?}
{132}{}{If I were you I would be getting as far away from this town as possible.}
{133}{}{You're a bad person!}
#after 110, option for reward 126
{134}{}{Doc Karl asked me to find some heart pills for his patients. Do you have any of those in your stock?}
#
{135}{}{I don't wanna know how you dealt with those robbers, but I do want to thank you. Here's some money for you.
 [Hands you $2000.] And some old gun I found a while ago, it's not the best, but perhaps you can shoot some rats with
 it. [He smiles.]}
#
{136}{}{Can I see your stock?}
#
{137}{}{What's the story behind that crashed Vertibird?}
{138}{}{It's an intricate piece of technology. From what I red in the ancient books, something that people used
 to fly around in and deliver death and destruction effectively by the push of a button. At present, people are more
 "knee-deep in brahmin shit" if you get my meaning. Its interior is completely stripped, some wiring is left hanging
 though... Ahem, are you here to buy something or what?}
