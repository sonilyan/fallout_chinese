#This is unused, but could be the starting point for a Tom character in MT. May need renumbering.
{101}{}{You see: a strong person wearing funny boots.}

{110}{}{Good day, stranger.}
{111}{}{How's it going?}
{112}{}{Are you new here?}
{113}{}{Greetings. New in town?}
{114}{}{Hello there, stranger.}
{115}{}{Heya.}
{116}{}{I don't know you. New here?}
{117}{}{Hi.}
{118}{}{Welcome, amigo.}
{119}{}{Now, where'd I put those water lilies?} #special
{120}{}{Geckos taste just like canned chicken, if you cook them right.}
{121}{}{Hear any rumors lately?}
{122}{}{Hello, traveler.}
{123}{}{Wind's picking up a bit.}
{124}{}{No rest for the poor.}
{125}{}{Nice day today.}
{126}{}{I'm going to relax with a nice stroll along the windy toxic float.} #special

{150}{}{Why don't you go back to prison?}
{151}{}{I'll give you some pretty beads if you leave me alone.}
{152}{}{::mumbles:: wasteland trash...}
{153}{}{I sure wish we had a wall around town that keeps people out.}
{154}{}{I don't have anything to steal; go away!}
{155}{}{Why are you looking at me like that?}
{156}{}{Great, another ex-con.}
{157}{}{Why don't you crawl back into your cell?}
{158}{}{Just keep away from me.}
{159}{}{We don't need you stirring up trouble.}
{160}{}{You must have come straight from Dumbtown!}
{161}{}{Last thing we need is more like you.}

{190}{}{Nice to see you.}
{191}{}{Any more like you at home?}
{192}{}{Hope you're enjoying it here.}
{193}{}{We could use a few more people of your caliber here.}
{194}{}{What's up, friend?}
{195}{}{Good fortune to you.}
{196}{}{If you need to buy anything, go to the Lady's House.} #special
{197}{}{Town's mine sure has a lot of rats.}
{198}{}{You're the most civilized ex-con I've ever met.}
{199}{}{Watch out for geckos that have changed color.}
{200}{}{Hello, traveler. Godspeed!}
{201}{}{Glad to have you in our town.}
{202}{}{That was nice, helping old Billy and all.} #special
{203}{}{Watch out for those patrols; they are dangerous.}

{204}{}{Hey there, stranger. I'm glad to see someone doing the right thing. By the way, I'm Tom. People call me
 Old Tom. Wanna hear about this town?}
{205}{}{Alright. Tell me about it.}
{208}{}{OK. Since this town is a small place, there is nothing really interesting here. We got this mine, it's famous
 because we got the finest coal from it... Now it's just a big hole. Nobody has gone down there for some twenty-five
 years or something like that. Still people say that in the midnight hours some strange voices can be heard. But... only
 me and my fellow are crazy enough to go down there and usually we find nothing. A real puzzler, wouldn't you say?
 People are getting scared over this. So, anyways, everything else is just fine.}
{209}{}{So, anything I could help you with?}
{213}{}{[Thinks.] Well, you could scout the mine during the midnight hours. Just hang around until you discover the
 source of those strange noises. When you find something, let me know. I'll be waiting here.}
{214}{}{See you later.}
{215}{}{Have you found something?}
{216}{}{Nothing yet.}
