#{1604}{}{Alright, I guess I can give you some drugs.}
{1604}{}{好吧，我想我可以给你一些药。}
#{1605}{}{Here's 10 caps. Try to buy something useful for them.}
{1605}{}{这是10个瓶盖。试着给他们买些有用的东西。}
#{1606}{}{I might know where you could get a load of drugs.}
{1606}{}{我可能知道你在哪里可以买到毒品。}
#{1607}{}{A group of imperial soldiers supposedly disappeared somewhere around here. Know anything about that?}
{1607}{}{一群帝国士兵在这附近失踪了。你知道吗？}
#{1608}{}{I do have something for you. But only if you lead me to that suspicious house we talked about.}
{1608}{}{我有东西要给你。但前提是你带我去我们谈过的可疑的房子。}
#{1609}{}{Would you happen to know where in the empire could I find a pulse pistol?}
{1609}{}{你知道帝国里哪里有脉冲手枪吗？}
#{1610}{}{I'm not giving you anything. Goodbye.}
{1610}{}{我不会给你任何东西。再见。}
#{1611}{}{Egh.}
{1611}{}{埃格。}
#{1650}{}{Where? Come on, tell me! Robbing stupid bums doesn't get me much. One of them actually vomited on me the last time. Disgusting.}
{1650}{}{哪里？快点，告诉我！抢劫愚蠢的流浪汉对我没什么好处。其中一个上次真的吐在我身上了。讨厌。}
#{1651}{}{They have more drugs than they need in the hospital.}
{1651}{}{他们在医院里的药物比他们需要的多。}
#{1652}{}{Do you know Chuck's weapon shop in the Hunters' Territory?}
{1652}{}{你知道查克在猎人领地的武器店吗？}
#{1653}{}{I actually wanted to talk about something else.}
{1653}{}{我其实想谈点别的。}
#{1700}{}{That's useless. I tried to steal from there, but the bastards guard the stuff too damn well. They wouldn't even let me in.}
{1700}{}{那没用。我想从那里偷东西，但是那些混蛋把东西看得太好了。他们甚至不让我进去。}
#{1701}{}{You won't have to steal anything. I paid for a whole load of drugs, just for you. We're friends, after all. Just go to Falber and tell him I sent you. Everything's already been arranged.}
{1701}{}{你不必偷任何东西。我为你付了一大堆药。毕竟我们是朋友。去找法伯，告诉他是我派你来的。一切都安排好了。}
#{1702}{}{You won't have to steal anything. I paid for a whole load of drugs, just for you. We're friends, after all. Just go to Falber and tell him I sent you. Everything's already been arranged.}
{1702}{}{你不必偷任何东西。我为你付了一大堆药。毕竟我们是朋友。去找法伯，告诉他是我派你来的。一切都安排好了。}
#{1750}{}{Holy crap! That's amazing. You're awesome, I can't believe it. I'll go there right away. Thanks, I mean it.}
{1750}{}{我靠！太神奇了。你真棒，真不敢相信。我马上就去。谢谢，我是认真的。}
#{1751}{}{Holy crap! That's amazing. You're awesome, I can't believe it. I'll go there right away. Thanks, I mean it.}
{1751}{}{我靠！太神奇了。你真棒，真不敢相信。我马上就去。谢谢，我是认真的。}
#{1752}{}{No need to thank me, Mario. No need at all.}
{1752}{}{不用谢我，马里奥。完全不需要。}
#{1800}{}{Yeah, so what? I want some drugs, not a stupid weapon. And Chuck's weird. Even for an old geezer.}
{1800}{}{是啊，那又怎样？我想要一些毒品，而不是愚蠢的武器。查克很奇怪。即使是一个老古董。}
#{1801}{}{If you pay Chuck a visit from time to time, be nice to him, and... Well, if you do everything he says, he'll always have enough free drugs for you. I've arranged everything with him already, just tell him I sent you.}
{1801}{}{如果你时不时拜访查克，对他好一点，然后。。。好吧，如果你照他说的做，他总会有足够的免费药物给你。我已经和他安排好了一切，告诉他是我派你来的。}
#{1802}{}{If you pay Chuck a visit from time to time, be nice to him, and... Well, if you do everything he says, he'll always have enough free drugs for you. I've arranged everything with him already, just tell him I sent you.}
{1802}{}{如果你时不时拜访查克，对他好一点，然后。。。好吧，如果你照他说的做，他总会有足够的免费药物给你。我已经和他安排好了一切，告诉他是我派你来的。}
#{1850}{}{Really? Alright then, I'll pay him a visit. But if that fatass wants me to work then he can piss right off, cause if I wanted that, I would've just stayed in the empire.}
{1850}{}{真正地？好吧，那我去拜访他。但如果那个混蛋想让我工作，他可以马上滚蛋，因为如果我想那样，我就留在帝国了。}
#{1851}{}{Don't worry, it won't be anything like that.}
{1851}{}{别担心，不会是那样的。}
#{1900}{}{That something else involves me getting some drugs, right? Come on, don't be mean.}
{1900}{}{其他的事情包括我吸毒，对吧？拜托，别小气。}
#{1901}{}{How good are you at picking pockets?}
{1901}{}{你有多擅长掏口袋？}
#{1902}{}{You shouldn't do drugs. It's bad for you.}
{1902}{}{你不应该吸毒。这对你不好。}
#{1903}{}{Alright, I guess I can give you some drugs.}
{1903}{}{好吧，我想我可以给你一些药。}
#{1904}{}{I might know where you could get a load of drugs.}
{1904}{}{我可能知道你在哪里可以买到毒品。}

{1907}{}{你知道帝国里哪里有脉冲手枪吗？}
#{1908}{}{No. I'm not giving you anything. Goodbye.}
{1908}{}{不，我什么都没给你。再见。}
#{1950}{}{Imperial soldiers in the Dead Quarter? But why would they be here? They can't find me here, right?}
{1950}{}{帝国士兵在死区？但他们为什么会在这里？他们在这里找不到我，对吗？}
#{1951}{}{Don't worry, they came here to search for Anonym. I doubt they'll send anyone to look for you.}
{1951}{}{别担心，他们是来找匿名者的。我怀疑他们会派人来找你。}
#{2000}{}{I'm not scared of them. Feh, stupid army blockheads getting lost in the damn Dead Quarter. Good thing I didn't join them.}
{2000}{}{我不怕他们。菲，愚蠢的军队笨蛋在该死的死区迷路了。幸好我没有加入他们。}
#{2001}{}{So you have no idea where they could be?}
{2001}{}{所以你不知道他们会在哪里？}
#{2050}{}{Nah, but I've heard of a house where something supposedly exploded. That's what soldiers do, you know, blow stuff up. The local bums are too scared to go take a look, and the house is locked, too. I'll take you there, but I want some high-quality stuff. No cheap crap, I want either Buffout, Mentats or Psycho.}
{2050}{}{不，但我听说有个房子发生了爆炸。士兵就是这么做的，你知道的，炸掉东西。当地的流浪汉吓得不敢去看，房子也锁上了。我会带你去的，但我想要一些高质量的东西。不便宜的废话，我要的要么是笨蛋，要么是精神病患者。}
#{2051}{}{How about this? [Give him Buffout.]}
{2051}{}{这个怎么样？[把他弄出来]}
#{2052}{}{Will this be enough? [Give him Mentats.]}
{2052}{}{这够了吗？[给他薄荷糖]}
#{2053}{}{[Give him Psycho.] Happy now?}
{2053}{}{[给他精神病]现在开心吗？}
#{2054}{}{I can't give you that. I don't have any of those.}
{2054}{}{我不能给你这个。我没有这些。}
#{2055}{}{Not interested. I'll find the soldiers without your help.}
{2055}{}{不感兴趣。没有你的帮助我会找到士兵的。}
#{2100}{}{Cool. [He snatches the drug and shakily starts opening the packaging.]}
{2100}{}{很酷。[他抓起药，摇摇晃晃地开始打开包装。]}
#{2101}{}{Whoa, not so fast. First, take me to that house.}
{2101}{}{哇，别那么快。首先，带我去那所房子。}
#{2150}{}{No, of course I wouldn't. Imperial soldiers don't lend their weapons to kids or tell them where they store them. You really are a stupid tribal.}
{2150}{}{不，我当然不会。帝国士兵不会把他们的武器借给孩子，也不会告诉他们把武器存放在哪里。你真是个愚蠢的部落。}
#{2151}{}{No, of course I wouldn't. Imperial soldiers don't lend their weapons to kids or tell them where they store them. You really are a stupid tribal.}
{2151}{}{不，我当然不会。帝国士兵不会把他们的武器借给孩子，也不会告诉他们把武器存放在哪里。你真是个愚蠢的部落。}
#{2152}{}{Was worth a try.}
{2152}{}{值得一试。}
#{2200}{}{What? Oh, it's you... What do you want?}
{2200}{}{什么？哦，是你。。。你想要什么？}
#{2201}{}{Is something wrong?}
{2201}{}{出什么事了吗？}
#{2202}{}{Would you happen to know where in the empire could I find a pulse pistol?}
{2202}{}{你知道帝国里哪里有脉冲手枪吗？}
#{2203}{}{Did you know you can score a solid amount of drugs in the hospital?}
{2203}{}{你知道你在医院里可以得到大量的药物吗？}
#{2204}{}{Nothing, I'll be on my way. See you.}
{2204}{}{没什么，我马上就来。再见。}
#{2205}{}{Egh.}
{2205}{}{埃格。}
#{2250}{}{No, I've been to Chuck's... It's nothing really... It's just that Chuck did some weird things... And it hurts...}
{2250}{}{不，我去过查克家。。。其实没什么。。。只是查克做了一些奇怪的事。。。而且很痛。。。}
#{2251}{}{Did he give you enough drugs for your visit?}
{2251}{}{他给你的药够你来吗？}
#{2300}{}{Yeah, he did. He said I should come again when I run out... I don't care what he does as long as I get the stuff! I just... It doesn't matter...}
{2300}{}{是的，他做到了。他说我用完后应该再来。。。我不管他做什么只要我拿到东西！我只是。。。没关系。。。}
#{2301}{}{Would you happen to know where in the empire could I find a pulse pistol?}

#{2303}{}{Cool. I'll be on my way. See you.}
{2303}{}{很酷。我马上就来。再见。}
#{2350}{}{No, I wouldn't. But Chuck was bragging that he had one. No idea how he got it. Maybe he was just lying.}
{2350}{}{不，我不会的。但是查克在吹嘘他有一个。不知道他是怎么得到的。也许他只是在撒谎。}
#{2351}{}{Would you steal it for me?}
{2351}{}{你能帮我偷吗？}
#{2352}{}{Thanks for the info.}
{2352}{}{谢谢你的信息。}
#{2400}{}{Hm. Not interested. Chuck gives me enough. I'm not going anywhere you send me again. So bite me.}
{2400}{}{嗯。不感兴趣。查克给了我足够的钱。你再派我来，我哪儿也不去。所以咬我。}
#{2401}{}{If you say so.}
{2401}{}{如果你这样说。}
#{2450}{}{No way. He might stop giving me the drugs... [He shivers.] Or do something much worse to me. Just leave me alone. I bet he doesn't even have it.}
{2450}{}{不可能。他可能会停止给我毒品。。。[他发抖]或者对我做更糟的事。别管我。我敢打赌他根本没有。}
#{2451}{}{Alright. I'll find out myself whether it's true or not.}
{2451}{}{好吧。我要自己弄清楚这是不是真的。}
#{2452}{}{Alright. I'll find out myself whether it's true or not.}
{2452}{}{好吧。我要自己弄清楚这是不是真的。}
#{2500}{}{You don't?! That... But you... I guess I'll just wait then. Get me something and I'll take you to that house, OK?}
{2500}{}{你不知道？！那个。。。但是你。。。我想我就等着吧。给我拿点东西，我带你去那所房子，好吗？}
#{2501}{}{We'll see.}
{2501}{}{我们拭目以待。}
#{2550}{}{Yeah, sure. That was the deal. So what do you have for me? Buffout, Mentats, or Psycho?}
{2550}{}{是的，当然。这就是交易。你有什么要给我的？布法特，曼塔茨，还是神经病？}
#{2551}{}{How about this? [Give him Buffout.]}
{2551}{}{这个怎么样？[把他弄出来]}
#{2552}{}{Will this be enough? [Give him Mentats.]}
{2552}{}{这够了吗？[给他薄荷糖]}
#{2553}{}{[Give him Psycho.] Happy now?}
{2553}{}{[给他精神病]现在开心吗？}
#{2554}{}{You know what? I changed my mind. I'll find the soldiers without your help.}
{2554}{}{你知道吗？我改变主意了。没有你的帮助我会找到士兵的。}
#{2555}{}{You know what? I changed my mind. I'll find the soldiers without your help.}
{2555}{}{你知道吗？我改变主意了。没有你的帮助我会找到士兵的。}
#{2600}{}{[The boy bumped into you intentionally to divert attention from his hand, which he twisted into an almost impossible angle as he put it into your pocket.
