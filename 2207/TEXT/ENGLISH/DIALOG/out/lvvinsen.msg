### {10}{}{[You see a decrepit old man at the controls. He mutters something under his breath, his little eyes constantly running around. Looks like he does not notice you.]}
{10}{}{[你看到一个年老的老人在控制。他低声喃喃自语，小眼睛不停地转来转去。看起来他没有注意到你。]}

{13}{008}{你好我可以打扰你吗？}




### {20}{}{[The old man glances in your direction. Quietly begins to mumble] Again someone came, I'm so sick of them, no respect at all... [he turns to you] Yes? What do you want?}
{20}{}{[老人朝你的方向瞥了一眼。安静地开始喃喃自语]又有人来了，我讨厌他们，一点也不尊重。。。[他转向你]是吗？你想要什么？}
### {21}{003}{Actually, not you, but You.}
{21}{003}{事实上，不是你，而是你。}
### {22}{005}{Yes, I would like to talk to you.}
{22}{005}{是的，我想和你谈谈。}
### {23}{008}{Yes, I wanted to talk to you.}
{23}{008}{是的，我想和你谈谈。}




### {30}{}{[The old man looks at you scornfully] What? I will never call such garbage as you "You"! But you should call me and other representatives of the proud family name Schwein on "You"!}
{30}{}{[老人轻蔑地看着你]什么？我决不会把你这种垃圾称作“你”！但你应该在“你”上称呼我和其他自豪的施韦恩家族的代表！}
### {31}{005}{Sorry, I get it. May I speak to You?}
{31}{005}{对不起，我明白了。我可以和你说话吗？}
### {32}{006}{Piss off, proud representative, you are disgusting.}
{32}{006}{撒尿吧，骄傲的代表，你真恶心。}
### {33}{004}{Schwein? Can't be! I am so glad to speak with one of the great Schweins!}
{33}{004}{施温？不可能！我很高兴能与一位伟大的施韦人交谈！}



### {40}{}{[The old man smiles smugly] Yes, you are lucky, unworthy. My name is Edward Vincent Von Schwein. You can call me Edward. It is an honor for you to call me only by name.}
{40}{}{[老人得意地笑了笑]是的，你很幸运，不值得。我的名字叫爱德华・文森特・冯・施韦恩。你可以叫我爱德华。你很荣幸能直呼我的名字。}

{43}{007}{你是个“傲慢的混蛋”。那是我给你打电话的唯一方式}

{50}{}{[老人软化了一点]这样更好。因为这里一半的流浪汉什么都不懂。我是爱德华・文森特・冯・施韦恩，但你可以叫我爱德华，因为你无论如何都记不清完整的名字了。}

{53}{007}{我想怎么打就怎么打。明白了，老家伙？}

{60}{}{[老人的眼睛里充满了愤怒]所以我，爱德华・施韦恩，不得不被外界的一些大便羞辱？滚出去，你这个秃头的豺狼！再多说一句话，炮塔就会把你撕裂！}

{1001}{}{[爱德华漠不关心地看着你]这是我们的新指挥官。发生了什么事？}

{1002}{}{[爱德华恼怒地看着你]我记得你，流浪汉。你是那个认为他很酷的混蛋，但事实上，他只是一堆Radius垃圾。}

{109}{999}{我得走了。稍后再谈。}



### {110}{}{[Edward hissed through his teeth with hatred in his voice] Okay, I'll give you a chance to quickly say what you want. It would be a waste to spend ammo on you.}

### {221}{010}{I have some questions.}
{221}{010}{我有一些问题。}

### {2301}{}{What is this, commander, a test? Okay, I'll play ball. This place is called Livos. The only place in the whole Radius where families of noble aristocratic blood were preserved. Only we reign in law and order, only we have a Constitution. No dictatorship - we decide everything at general meetings. Our great leaders will soon control the entire Radius, as it befits them by birthright. We own the only source of clean water that can be provided for everyone. Should we have any enemies, we simply cut them off our supply of water, then they'll just die out. Thus, our great mission is to create a new society and to decide the fate of humanity.}
{2301}{}{这是什么，指挥官，测试？好的，我打球。这个地方叫利沃斯。整个Radius唯一保存着贵族血统的家族的地方。只有我们在法律和秩序中统治，只有我们有宪法。没有独裁――我们在大会上决定一切。我们伟大的领导人将很快控制整个半径，因为这与他们天生的权利相称。我们拥有唯一可以为每个人提供的清洁水源。如果我们有敌人，我们只要切断他们的供水，他们就会灭绝。因此，我们的伟大使命是创造一个新社会，决定人类的命运。}
### {2302}{}{This is Livos, the best place in Radius, the only supplier of clean water. Now get lost.}
{2302}{}{这是利沃斯，Radius最好的地方，唯一的清洁水供应商。现在迷路吧。}
### {2303}{}{[Edward straightens out and continues with pride in his voice.] This place is called Livos. The only place in the whole Radius where families of noble aristocratic blood were preserved. Only we live in law and order, only we have a Constitution. No dictatorship - we decide everything at general meetings. Our great leaders will soon control the entire Radius, as befits them by birthright. We own the only source of clean water that can be provided for everyone. Should we have any enemies, we simply cut them off our supply of water, then they'll just die out. Thus, our great mission is to create a new society and to decide the fate of humanity.}
{2303}{}{[爱德华挺直腰板，继续用他的声音自豪地说。]这个地方叫利沃斯。整个Radius唯一保存着贵族血统的家族的地方。只有我们生活在法律和秩序中，只有我们有宪法。没有独裁――我们在大会上决定一切。我们伟大的领导人将很快控制整个半径，这与他们天生的权利相称。我们拥有唯一可以为每个人提供的清洁水源。如果我们有敌人，我们只要切断他们的供水，他们就会灭绝。因此，我们的伟大使命是创造一个新社会，决定人类的命运。}

{233}{037}{我能进去和其他居民谈谈吗？}
### {234}{010}{One more question.}
{234}{010}{还有一个问题。}
### {235}{999}{Clear. See you later, I will go.}
{235}{999}{清楚的回头见，我去。}

### {2401}{}{You are such a prankster, commander. Don't you recognize your Livos?}
{2401}{}{你真是个恶作剧者，指挥官。你不认识你的丽芙了吗？}
### {2402}{}{This is the entrance to the Livos vault. That's enough, outsiders like you are not supposed to know more. Now get out of here, tramp.}
{2402}{}{这是利沃斯金库的入口。这就足够了，像你这样的局外人不应该知道更多。现在离开这里，流浪汉。}
### {2403}{}{This is the entrance to the Livos vault. It serves as home and shelter to the best representatives of the human race. We rarely go outside - this world is not yet worthy of our ideas. Our refuge is the heart and soul of a civilized society.}
{2403}{}{这是利沃斯金库的入口。它是人类最优秀代表的家园和庇护所。我们很少出门――这个世界还配不上我们的想法。我们的避难所是文明社会的核心和灵魂。}
### {241}{023}{I want to hear more about this place.}
{241}{023}{我想了解更多关于这个地方的情况。}
### {242}{037}{Can I get inside?}

### {243}{010}{I'll ask more.}
{243}{010}{我会问更多的。}
### {244}{999}{Okay, I'll go, we'll talk later.}
{244}{999}{好的，我走，我们稍后再谈。}

### {2501}{}{[Edward looks annoyed] You can buy and sell things near those tables and roll away from here.}
{2501}{}{[爱德华看起来很生气]你可以在那些桌子附近买卖东西，然后从这里滚出去。}
### {2502}{}{[Edward makes a sour face and mutters] My god, I'm so fed up with all this... [he looks up and continues as if explaining it to a five-year-old child] From here you can see the tables near the entrance. The things are laid out on them. You can buy there, you can sell yours, you can barter. Go to those merchants and talk to them. [he adds quietly] And if you need some good alcohol, I have a few bottles to spare.}
{2502}{}{[爱德华酸着脸喃喃自语]天哪，我受够了这一切。。。[他抬起头继续说，好像在向一个五岁的孩子解释一样]从这里你可以看到入口附近的桌子。东西都摆在上面了。你可以在那里购买，你可以出售你的，你可以易货。去找那些商人，和他们谈谈。[他轻声补充道]如果你需要一些好酒，我还有几瓶备用。}
### {251}{Barter}{Show me the alcohol you've got.}
{251}{Barter}{给我看看你的酒。}
### {252}{010}{I'll ask more.}
{252}{010}{我会问更多的。}
### {253}{999}{I'll go talk to the sellers.}
{253}{999}{我去和卖家谈谈。}

### {2601}{}{[Edward hissed through his teeth] This is not your business, tramp. This is what you must remember: I am Edward Schwein, and I do not want to see you here.}
{2601}{}{[爱德华咬牙切齿]这不关你的事，流浪汉。这是你必须记住的：我是爱德华・施韦恩，我不想在这里见到你。}
### {2602}{}{[Edward begins to speak with a fanatical glitter in his eyes] The name of the Schweins is the most famous and significant in Livos, and therefore - in the whole Radius! Only thanks to Schweins, Livos continues to live. The Schwein family has developed all the new laser and plasma weapons. I am the Schwein-senior, and only I have been entrusted with the most important job - to guard the entrance to Livos from all kinds of vagrants. }
{2602}{}{[爱德华开始说话时眼中闪烁着狂热的光芒]施温人的名字在利沃斯是最著名和最重要的，因此在整个半径范围内也是如此！只有多亏了施温斯，利沃斯才能继续活下去。施温家族已经研制出了所有新型的激光和等离子体武器。我是施温学长，只有我被赋予了最重要的工作――守卫利沃什的入口，防止各种流浪者进入。}
### {261}{037}{Can I get inside?}
{261}{037}{我能进去吗？}
### {262}{057}{Tell us about other representatives of the Schwein name.}
{262}{057}{请告诉我们关于施魏因名字的其他代表。}
### {263}{006}{Somehow you do not like a great family. More like pushers and misers.}
{263}{006}{不知怎么的，你不喜欢一个大家庭。更像是暴民和吝啬鬼。}
### {264}{010}{One more question.}
{264}{010}{还有一个问题。}
### {265}{999}{I'll go, talk later.}
{265}{999}{我去，稍后再谈。}

### {2701}{}{[Edward squints contemptuously] I can make that turret turn you into minced meat if you will not get out of here.}
{2701}{}{[爱德华轻蔑地眯着眼睛]如果你不离开这里，我可以让那座炮塔把你变成肉末。}
### {2702}{}{[Edward proudly raises his head] I am the most important member in Livos, I am responsible for its safety. Only I can allow the passage to Livos. If some tramp wants to go through the door to the vault, I turn on the turret. Though, I, as the oldest and most experienced member of the Schweins family, can afford to have a slight weakness: I really like to collect various rarities. So if you have something unusual, I would look at it.}
{2702}{}{[爱德华骄傲地抬起头]我是利沃斯最重要的成员，我对它的安全负责。只有我才能允许前往利沃斯。如果有流浪汉想进门去金库，我就打开炮塔。不过，作为Schweins家族中年龄最大、经验最丰富的成员，我可以承受一个小小的弱点：我真的很喜欢收集各种稀有物品。所以，如果你有什么不寻常的东西，我会看看。}
### {271}{028}{Here [show your stuff to Edward]}
{271}{028}{给[给爱德华看看你的东西]}
### {272}{029}{Here [show your stuff to Edward]}

### {275}{061}{Which things do you have in your collection?}
{275}{061}{你收藏了哪些东西？}
### {276}{999}{I'd rather go.}
{276}{999}{我宁愿去。}

### {280}{}{[Edward is looking at your things from behind the glass] This is rubbish... This is also rubbish... No one needs this at all... No, you have nothing interesting for me. I need rare mechanisms, or parts of a robot, for example. }
{280}{}{[爱德华从玻璃后面看你的东西]这是垃圾。。。这也是垃圾。。。根本没有人需要这个。。。不，你对我来说没有什么有趣的。例如，我需要稀有的机械装置或机器人的零件。}
### {281}{999}{Fine, I'll go look for something.}
{281}{999}{好吧，我去找点什么。}
### {282}{010}{It's a pity, then I'll ask more.}
{282}{010}{很遗憾，那我再多问一些。}

### {290}{}{[Edward is looking at your things through the glass] This is rubbish... This is also rubbish... Oh! Wow! Here is some find! What a wonderful thing! The hand of a construction robot! Listen, I really want to have one in my collection.}
{290}{}{[爱德华透过玻璃看你的东西]这是垃圾。。。这也是垃圾。。。哦哇！这里有一些发现！多么美妙的事情！建筑机器人的手！听着，我真的很想在我的收藏中有一个。}
### {291}{030}{I don't really need it, so I can sell it to you. How much will you pay for it?}
{291}{030}{我其实并不需要它，所以我可以把它卖给你。你要付多少钱？}
### {292}{034}{I can give it to you - in exchange for a free passage to Livos.}
{292}{034}{我可以把它给你，以换取免费前往利沃斯的通道。}
### {293}{032}{As a member of Livos, I can sell you this hand at a discounted price.}
{293}{032}{作为Livos的一员，我可以以折扣价卖给你这只手。}
### {294}{010}{No, I'll keep it for myself. Maybe it will come in handy later. Let's talk about something else.}
{294}{010}{不，我自己留着。也许它稍后会派上用场。让我们谈谈其他事情。}
### {295}{999}{I'm going to think about whether I need it or not.}
{295}{999}{我要考虑一下我是否需要它。}

### {300}{}{[Edward crunches, eagerly going over the batteries under the table] N-no, I can not afford to buy such things... Maybe we can find another way, without costs?}
{300}{}{[爱德华嘎吱嘎吱地说，急切地查看桌子下面的电池]不，我买不起这样的东西。。。也许我们可以找到另一种方法，不需要成本？}
### {301}{031}{I need batteries. I won't agree to anything else.}
{301}{031}{我需要电池。我不会同意其他任何事情。}
### {302}{034}{For this hand, will you let me go to Livos?}

### {304}{999}{Batteries only. I'll come back later when you pick it up.}
{304}{999}{仅限电池。等你把它捡起来我再回来。}

### {310}{}{[Edward shrinks even more, clutching at his batteries, then suddenly backs out] No! I can't spend a single battery on this! I need them more than a robot hand! Let's think of something else!}
{310}{}{[爱德华更加退缩，紧紧抓住电池，然后突然后退]不！我不能在这上面花一块电池！我需要他们而不是机械手！让我们想想别的吧！}
### {311}{034}{Let's do it like this: I give you this hand, and you will let me into the vault.}
{311}{034}{让我们这样做：我把手伸给你，你就会让我进入金库。}
### {312}{010}{If there are no batteries, there is no robot arm. Let's talk about something else.}

{313}{999}{没有电池我不会放手。我现在就去――你想想付款的问题。}

### {3201}{}{[Edward, with visible strong shakes, slowly counts out a certain amount] I only have 60 batteries, I can not afford anymore... And this is only because you are a member of Livos.}
{3201}{}{[爱德华，明显地剧烈摇晃，慢慢地数出一定的数量]我只有60块电池，我再也负担不起了。。。这只是因为你是利沃斯的一员。}
### {3202}{}{[Edward, with visible strong shakes, slowly counts out a certain amount] I only have 45 batteries, I can not afford anymore... And this is only because you are a member of Livos.}
{3202}{}{[爱德华，明显地剧烈摇晃，慢慢地数出一定的数量]我只有45块电池，我再也负担不起了。。。这只是因为你是利沃斯的一员。}

{324}{999}{不，我去找另一个买家。}

### {330}{}{[Edward reluctantly gives away the bag of batteries. But when he takes the Robotron's arm, he begins to gently stroke and hug it.] Oh, what a wonderful thing, what a rarity... Oh, my darling...}
{330}{}{[爱德华不情愿地把电池袋送人。但当他拿起机器人的手臂时，他开始轻轻地抚摸和拥抱它。]哦，多么美妙的事情，多么罕见。。。哦，亲爱的。。。}

{331}{999}{[你让爱德华独自一人从事这个感人的职业]}

{340}{}{[爱德华犹豫了一下]我不知道，这件事太棒了，但如果你不是Livos的成员，我不能让你进去。。。}
### {341}{035}{This is a great thing! You will not find it anywhere else. Make me a member of Livos - and that's it, the hand is yours!}
{341}{035}{这是一件伟大的事情！你在其他地方找不到它。让我成为Livos的一员――就这样，这只手是你的！}

### {351}{036}{Take it!}
{351}{036}{拿着！}

### {360}{}{[Edward quickly gives you the paper] Here - a paper about the adoption from a family, with it you can safely pass. [he takes the Robotron's arm, and starts to gently stroke and cuddle it] Oh, what a wonderful thing, what a rarity... Oh, my darling...}
{360}{}{[爱德华很快把纸给你]这是一张关于从一个家庭领养的纸，有了它你就可以安全地通过了。[他抓住机器人的手臂，开始轻轻地抚摸和拥抱它]哦，多么美妙的事情，多么罕见。。。哦，亲爱的。。。}
### {361}{999}{[You leave Edward alone with this touching occupation]}
{361}{999}{[你让爱德华独自一人从事这个感人的职业]}

### {3701}{}{Of course, you can go inside at any time, you're one of us.}
{3701}{}{当然，你可以随时进去，你是我们中的一员。}

{3702}{}{不，只有世袭贵族才能进入利沃斯。严禁流浪。如果你想通过，我会打开炮塔。}

{371}{038}{NWO要求我了解供水情况。有一种水的味道，人们很担心。}

{372}{039}{我不是流浪汉！在我出生的地方，我是一个著名的贵族！为了我们的共同利益，我可以成为你们家庭的一员。}

{373}{045}{精彩的我找你已经很久了！我远房亲戚的家，真正的贵族！}
### {374}{058}{I brought you the Constitution, didn't I deserve to be one of you?}
{374}{058}{我给你带来了宪法，难道我不配成为你们中的一员吗？}
### {375}{010}{Understood. I'd like to ask something else.}
{375}{010}{明白了。我想问些别的问题。}
### {376}{999}{Okay. I'll come later.}
{376}{999}{可以我稍后再来。}

### {380}{}{[Edward looks at you with bewilderment] Uh-uh... I don't know anything about this. I do not supply water. Ask Christopher, he is at the trading table, maybe he knows.}
{380}{}{[爱德华困惑地看着你]呃。。。我对此一无所知。我不供水。问问克里斯托弗，他在交易桌上，也许他知道。}
### {381}{010}{I'd like to ask something else.}
{381}{010}{我想问些别的问题。}
### {382}{999}{I'll go talk to him.}
{382}{999}{我去和他谈谈。}

### {390}{}{[Edward looks at you with suspicion.] Really? You look more like an ordinary vagabond, rather than a rich and famous person. It is full of beggar rabble, nowadays everyone wants to become a member of Livos. What evidence do you have?}
{390}{}{[爱德华怀疑地看着你。]真的吗？你看起来更像一个普通的流浪汉，而不是一个有钱又出名的人。这里到处都是乞丐乌合之众，如今每个人都想成为利沃斯的一员。你有什么证据？}
### {391}{040}{My honest word of a nobleman - this is all I have!}
{391}{040}{我对一个贵族的诚实承诺――这就是我的全部！}
### {392}{042}{I can easily prove that I am rich by making a donation to Livos' development.}
{392}{042}{我可以通过为利沃斯的发展捐款来证明我很富有。}
### {393}{041}{I have no evidence.}

### {394}{010}{Let's leave this topic, I want to know about something else.}
{394}{010}{让我们离开这个话题，我想了解一些其他的事情。}
### {395}{999}{I'll think about the evidence. When I find it - I'll come back.}
{395}{999}{我会考虑证据的。当我找到它的时候，我会回来的。}

### {400}{}{[Edward burst out laughing] Shove your honest word of a nobleman up yours! The beggars are often using such tricks to get to us, but it won't do!}
{400}{}{[爱德华突然大笑起来]把你对一个贵族的诚实的话塞进你的嘴里！乞丐们经常用这样的伎俩来接近我们，但无济于事！}
### {401}{042}{I can prove that I am not a beggar by making a donation to Livos' development.}
{401}{042}{我可以通过为利沃斯的发展捐款来证明我不是一个乞丐。}

{410}{}{哈哈哈！离开这里，贵族！我每天都看到这样的贵族，他们乞求电池！}
### {411}{999}{Fine, I'll go...}
{411}{999}{好吧，我去。。。}

### {420}{}{[Edward stared at you greedily] A small amount, you say? This is solid proof of noble origin... Can you donate, say, 1,500 batteries for the development of Livos?}
{420}{}{[爱德华贪婪地盯着你]你说是一小笔？这是高贵出身的确凿证据。。。比如说，你能捐赠1500块电池用于Livos的开发吗？}
### {421}{043}{Yes, easily. For me, it is a trifle.}
{421}{043}{是的，很容易。对我来说，这只是一件小事。}
### {422}{041}{I do not have such funds.}
{422}{041}{我没有这样的资金。}

### {430}{}{[Edward hatches, his hands shake.] What? Is it a minor thing for you? Of course, come here with the batteries, and I will, of course, spend them on the prosperity of Livos! Just don't tell anyone about this, I want to remain anonymous. }
{430}{}{[爱德华孵化，双手颤抖。]什么？这对你来说是小事吗？当然，带着电池来这里，我当然会把它们花在利沃斯的繁荣上！只是不要告诉任何人这件事，我想保持匿名。}
### {431}{044}{Here, take them, I don't mind.}
{431}{044}{给，拿着，我不介意。}
### {432}{999}{You know, I changed my mind. Bye.}
{432}{999}{你知道，我改变了主意。再见}

### {440}{}{[Edward quickly counts the batteries with a smile on his face and a slightly incomprehensible mumbling] Fine, very good! You are a real nobleman, here are your papers, now you are one of us! You can safely go inside the vault. [looks like he lost all interest in you and slowly began to put the batteries in small piles]}
{440}{}{[爱德华很快数了数电池，脸上带着微笑，有点难以理解地喃喃自语：“好，非常好！”！你是一个真正的贵族，这是你的文件，现在你是我们中的一员！你可以安全地进入保险库。[看起来他对你失去了所有的兴趣，慢慢地开始把电池堆成小堆]}
### {441}{999}{[You leave quietly]}
{441}{999}{[你悄悄地离开]}

### {450}{}{[He looks at you incredulously. Our whole family, starting with Sebastian Schwein, the founder of this shelter, lived here and had no contact with the outside world.}
{450}{}{[他怀疑地看着你。我们全家，从这个庇护所的创始人塞巴斯蒂安・施韦恩开始，都住在这里，与外界没有任何联系。}
### {451}{046}{Exactly! My distant ancestor is the son of Sebastian Schwein! He did not have time to get to the vault before the outbreak of war, and then all my ancestors tried to find you. And only I managed to do it! I am happy to be reunited again with the great family of the Schweins!}
{451}{046}{确切地我的远祖是Sebastian Schwein的儿子！战争爆发前，他没有时间到达金库，然后我所有的祖先都试图找到你。只有我做到了！我很高兴再次与施魏因一家团聚！}
### {452}{047}{Exactly! My distant ancestor is the son of Sebastian Schwein! He did not have time to get to the vault before the outbreak of war, and then all my ancestors tried to find you. And only I managed to do it! I am happy to be reunited again with the great family of the Schweins!}
{452}{047}{确切地我的远祖是Sebastian Schwein的儿子！战争爆发前，他没有时间到达金库，然后我所有的祖先都试图找到你。只有我做到了！我很高兴再次与施魏因一家团聚！}

{460}{}{是的，有一些关于塞巴斯蒂安的某个亲戚的旧记录，他没有进入金库。。。我从没想过我们会遇到他的后代！好吧，欢迎来到利沃斯！你可以安全地进去。}

{461}{999}{谢谢你，我会去见我们家的其他人。}

### {470}{}{Yes, there are some old records about a certain relative of Sebastian, who didn't make it to the vault... But look at yourself! You're black as coal, and all the other Schweins are white!}
{470}{}{是的，有一些关于塞巴斯蒂安的某个亲戚的旧记录，他没有进入金库。。。但看看你自己！你黑得像煤，而其他的施威人都是白人！}
### {471}{048}{This long life in inhuman conditions left its mark! And the effect of radiation changed the color of my skin. But inside I am the same as you, the true descendant of the great Schweins!}
{471}{048}{这种在非人条件下的漫长生活留下了印记！辐射的影响改变了我的皮肤颜色。但在内心，我和你是一样的，伟大的施魏因的真正后裔！}
### {472}{999}{Yes, it does not match... Well, see you later.}
{472}{999}{是的，它不匹配。。。好吧，回头见。}

### {480}{}{Yes, radiation influenced you a lot. But I'm still glad that we met a descendant of Sebastian! Well, welcome to Livos! You can safely go inside.}
{480}{}{是的，辐射对你影响很大。但我仍然很高兴我们遇到了塞巴斯蒂安的后裔！好吧，欢迎来到利沃斯！你可以安全地进去。}

{481}{999}{谢谢你，我会去见我们家的其他人。}

### {490}{}{[Edward pointedly raised his finger] The Constitution is the basis of our rights. Each member has 15 rights, which are recorded in this constitution.}
{490}{}{[爱德华尖锐地竖起手指]宪法是我们权利的基础。每个成员都有15项权利，这些权利被记录在本宪法中。}
### {491}{050}{Can I see these rights of the residents of Livos?}
{491}{050}{我能看到利沃斯居民的这些权利吗？}

### {500}{}{No, the Constitution is only for the residents of Livos. And I do not want to talk about it, because, according to paragraph 8 of the Constitution, "Every inhabitant of the New World has the right not to talk to other inhabitants of the New World, even if the latter strongly insist."}
{500}{}{不，宪法只适用于利沃什的居民。我不想谈论它，因为根据《宪法》第8段，“新世界的每一位居民都有权不与新世界的其他居民交谈，即使后者强烈要求。”}
### {501}{010}{It's a pity. I also wanted to ask.}
{501}{010}{很遗憾。我也想问一下。}
### {502}{051}{You know, I am very well versed in this kind of documents. I could tell you how to use the points of the Constitution for your benefit.}
{502}{051}{你知道，我对这类文件非常精通。我可以告诉你如何利用宪法的要点为你谋利。}
### {503}{052}{Come on, you have none! You probably accidentally sold the constitution to some kind of savage two meters tall, and now you can't get it back!}
{503}{052}{来吧，你没有！你可能不小心把体质卖给了一个两米高的野蛮人，现在你再也拿不回来了！}
### {504}{053}{And, according to the Constitution, can anyone make someone talk by force?}
{504}{053}{而且，根据宪法，任何人都能强迫别人用武力说话吗？}

### {510}{}{That would be very useful... Okay, I will tell you a secret: I accidentally sold the Constitution to some savage two meters tall, and now I do not know how to return it. Find it, give it back to me, don't tell anyone. I will reward you generously. And, of course, I will tell you where to look for this tribe.}
{510}{}{那将非常有用。。。好吧，我告诉你一个秘密：我不小心把宪法卖给了一个两米高的野蛮人，现在我不知道如何归还。找到它，还给我，不要告诉任何人。我会慷慨地报答你。当然，我会告诉你在哪里可以找到这个部落。}

{522}{010}{我现在没有时间做这个。让我们谈谈其他事情。}

### {530}{}{No, there's nothing about such things in the constitution. [He looks at you] You know, I like your spirit. I might need a man with your attitude. I accidentally sold the Constitution to some savage two meters tall, and now I do not know how to return it. Find it, give it back to me, don't tell anyone. I will reward you generously. And, of course, I will tell you where to look for this tribe.}
{530}{}{不，宪法中没有这样的规定。[他看着你]你知道，我喜欢你的精神。我可能需要一个有你这种态度的男人。我不小心把宪法卖给了一个两米高的野蛮人，现在我不知道如何归还。找到它，还给我，不要告诉任何人。我会慷慨地报答你。当然，我会告诉你在哪里可以找到这个部落。}

### {560}{}{Great! Give it to me! A generous reward awaits you!}
{560}{}{太棒了把它给我！丰厚的奖励等着你！}
### {561}{999}{Here, don't lose it anymore.}
{561}{999}{给你，别再丢了。}

### {570}{}{[Edward reluctantly began to mumble] You... Why do you need to know about others? The most important thing here is me, therefore I occupy a post in the tracking room. I am the oldest in our family. I have a brother, Ludwig. He sits all day and picks in the workshop with his lasers. His son, Christopher, is trading at that table. If you want, go talk to him. He will tell you more about his parents, Ludwig and Veronica.}
{570}{}{[爱德华不情愿地开始喃喃自语]你。。。为什么你需要了解别人？这里最重要的是我，因此我在跟踪室里占据了一个职位。我是我们家年龄最大的。我有一个兄弟，路德维希。他整天坐在那里，用激光在车间里采摘。他的儿子克里斯托弗在那张桌子上交易。如果你愿意，去和他谈谈。他会告诉你更多关于他的父母，路德维希和维罗妮卡的事情。}

{591}{060}{他们说Radius想抓Livos。他们想在这场战争中成为你的盟友。}

### {600}{}{We will conquer everything around us without the help of these assholes! I'm not going to conclude an alliance! Tell them to go where the sun doesn't shine with their suggestions. The Schwein family definitely won't talk to them. Ask the heads of other families, maybe they could want something from these vagrants.}
{600}{}{没有这些混蛋的帮助，我们将征服我们周围的一切！我不会缔结联盟！告诉他们按照他们的建议去阳光不充足的地方。施温一家肯定不会和他们说话。问问其他家庭的户主，也许他们想从这些流浪汉那里得到一些东西。}

{601}{010}{好吧，我去问问其他人。}

### {610}{}{Oh, I have a lot of rare and unique things! From around the Radius, I bring them! True, I do not know what they are called. The main thing is that these are complex mechanical systems. I bring things from Oasis, Tin Industries, Rainbows, NWO, and even from Olympus itself!}
{610}{}{哦，我有很多稀有而独特的东西！从半径周围，我带来他们！的确，我不知道它们叫什么。最主要的是，这些都是复杂的机械系统。我带来的东西来自绿洲，锡工业，彩虹，NWO，甚至奥林巴斯本身！}
