#{100}{}{You see a ghoul.}

#{150}{}{You see Erick.}
{150}{}{你看到埃里克了。}
#{200}{}{You see a ghoul in a robe at a table all alone, but he doesn't seem to mind it.}
{200}{}{你看到一个穿着长袍的僵尸独自一人坐在桌子旁，但他似乎并不介意。}
#{201}{}{You see a scientist of the Rebirth.}
{201}{}{你看到一个重生的科学家。}
#{250}{}{You see Erick, a scientist enjoying his free time.}
{250}{}{你看埃里克，一个享受空闲时间的科学家。}
#{251}{}{You see Erick, a scientist who wanted to enjoy his free time.}

#{300}{}{I don't intend to talk to you any longer.}
{300}{}{我不打算再和你说话了。}
#{301}{}{I'm going to get some sleep now.}

#{302}{}{Would you kindly stop following me?}

#{501}{}{Who are you?}

#{502}{}{I'm sorry. Goodbye.}

#{503}{}{Oopsie!}
{503}{}{哎呀！}
#{550}{}{What do you care?! Do you have any idea how many things I have to deal with, and how hard it was for me to make some free time for myself that I want to spend without arguing with someone?! No, I don't think you do, I doubt you have access to the red levels.}
{550}{}{你在乎什么？！你知道我要处理多少事情吗？我很难腾出空闲时间来不跟别人吵架吗？！不，我不认为你有，我怀疑你有进入红色水平。}
#{551}{}{I may be looking for you.}
{551}{}{我可能在找你。}
#{600}{}{My name is Erick. So?}
{600}{}{我叫埃里克。所以呢？}
#{601}{}{You are exactly who I'm looking for. The guards have reported that there are some problems with your access card. I have to take care of it.}
{601}{}{你正是我要找的人。警卫报告说你的门禁卡有问题。我得照顾它。}
#{602}{}{I'm not looking for you.}
{602}{}{我不是在找你。}
#{650}{}{And how exactly?}
{650}{}{到底是怎么回事？}
#{651}{}{You can give it to me, you don't have to care about the rest.}
{651}{}{你可以把它给我，你不必关心其他的。}
#{652}{}{You lend me the card, I take care of everything in the lab on Yellow 3, and then I'll give it back to you. Sure, you could do it yourself, but they sent me so you don't waste your precious time.}
{652}{}{你把卡借给我，黄3号上实验室的一切我都会处理好，然后还给你。当然，你可以自己做，但他们派我来是为了你不浪费宝贵的时间。}
#{700}{}{What are you babbling about?! I'm not allowed to hand out the card. I better find out myself what this is all about on my way back to work.}
{700}{}{你在胡说什么？！我不被允许分发卡片。我最好在回去工作的路上弄清楚这是怎么回事。}
#{701}{}{Are you going to spend all your free time here?}
{701}{}{你打算把所有的空闲时间都花在这里吗？}
#{702}{}{What exactly are you doing down there on the red levels?}
{702}{}{你到底在红层下面干什么？}
#{703}{}{OK. Goodbye.}
{703}{}{好 啊。再见。}
#{750}{}{Finally someone understands that my contentment is important for my work to have good results. Here you are. [He gives you a red access card.] I expect to have it back before I have to go back to work.}
{750}{}{终于有人明白了我的满足感对我的工作取得好的结果是很重要的。给你。[他给了你一张红色通行证]我想在回去工作之前把它拿回来。}
#{751}{}{Of course. I'll deal with it right now, bye.}
{751}{}{当然。我马上处理，再见。}
#{800}{}{So you better go disturb someone else.}
{800}{}{所以你最好去打扰别人。}
#{801}{}{Are you going to spend all your free time here?}
{801}{}{你打算把所有的空闲时间都花在这里吗？}
#{802}{}{What exactly are you doing down there on the red levels?}
{802}{}{你到底在红层下面干什么？}
#{803}{}{OK. Goodbye.}
{803}{}{好 啊。再见。}
#{850}{}{I can't talk about it with you. If you don't realize it, then Leonard doesn't do his job properly.}
{850}{}{我不能和你谈这个。如果你没有意识到这一点，那么伦纳德就没有做好他的工作。}
#{851}{}{Are you going to spend all your free time here?}
{851}{}{你打算把所有的空闲时间都花在这里吗？}
#{852}{}{When are you planning to go to get some sleep in your room?}
{852}{}{你打算什么时候去你的房间睡觉？}
#{853}{}{I won't disturb you anymore.}
{853}{}{我不会再打扰你了。}
#{900}{}{Why would I do so?! I've got the best room reserved for me. It's perfectly soundproof, I wouldn't even hear gunshots in the hallway. That's the place I'm going to sleep. I don't even remember the last time I got a proper sleep.}
{900}{}{我为什么要这么做？！我预订了最好的房间。它完全隔音，我甚至听不到走廊里的枪声。那是我要睡觉的地方。我都不记得上次睡个好觉是什么时候了。}
#{901}{}{I assume that it's not possible to hear any sound from inside the room as well.}
{901}{}{我想房间里也听不到任何声音。}
#{902}{}{When are you planning to go there?}
{902}{}{你打算什么时候去那儿？}
#{950}{}{I'm absolutely sure that I don't snore, if you're trying to imply something like that.}
{950}{}{如果你想暗示什么的话，我肯定我不会打鼾。}
#{951}{}{When are you planning to go to that room?}
{951}{}{你打算什么时候去那个房间？}
#{1000}{}{When I feel like it. I don't understand why you care!}
{1000}{}{当我想的时候。我不明白你为什么在乎！}
#{1001}{}{I'm just asking.}
{1001}{}{我只是问问。}
#{1002}{}{Actually, I don't. Goodbye.}
{1002}{}{实际上，我不知道。再见。}
#{1050}{}{It would be better if you minded your own business. It's more then enough that we have Cecilia here who spies on whoever she can, instead of making a proper meal.}
{1050}{}{你要是管好自己的事就好了。我们这里有塞西莉亚，她可以监视任何人，而不是做一顿正餐，这就足够了。}
#{1051}{}{I see.}
{1051}{}{我懂了。}
#{1052}{}{I don't want to listen to you anymore, goodbye.}
{1052}{}{我不想再听你的了，再见。}
#{1100}{}{And then there's this damn Mr. Handy. Robert surely went into hiding as soon as he found out that he got some work to do here. One time we weren't able to work for five straight days because of the broken robot, only then he decided to fix it!}
{1100}{}{还有这个该死的汉迪先生。罗伯特一发现这里有工作要做，肯定就躲起来了。有一次，因为坏了的机器人，我们连续五天不能工作，直到那时他才决定修理它！}
#{1101}{}{I see.}
{1101}{}{我懂了。}
#{1102}{}{I don't want to listen to you anymore, goodbye.}
{1102}{}{我不想再听你的了，再见。}
#{1103}{}{And then there's this damn Mr. Handy. He was bumping into people around him and now, as far as I know, it doesn't work anymore. Robert surely went into hiding as soon as he found out that he got some work to do here. One time we weren't able to work for five straight days because of the broken robot, only then he decided to fix it!}
{1103}{}{还有这个该死的汉迪先生。他撞到了周围的人，现在，据我所知，这已经不起作用了。罗伯特一发现这里有工作要做，肯定就躲起来了。有一次，因为坏了的机器人，我们连续五天不能工作，直到那时他才决定修理它！}
#{1150}{}{Talking of incompetence, I always have to ask, how come we weren't able to catch the Thirteenth when we've got so many soldiers?! And I won't even mention the fact that the number and quality of normals caught during the last few months is really poor.}
{1150}{}{说到无能，我总是要问，我们有这么多士兵，怎么还赶不上十三号？！我甚至不想提及在过去几个月里捕捉到的正常人的数量和质量真的很差的事实。}
#{1151}{}{I see.}
{1151}{}{我懂了。}
#{1152}{}{I don't want to listen to you anymore, goodbye.}
{1152}{}{我不想再听你的了，再见。}
#{1200}{}{And what's more, I've got a feeling that only nutcases work on the third floor. And when I realize that they're in charge of weapons! I don't tend to stay there if it's not absolutely necessary.}
{1200}{}{而且，我觉得只有疯子才能在三楼工作。当我意识到他们掌管武器的时候！如果不是绝对必要的话，我不想呆在那里。}
#{1201}{}{I see.}
{1201}{}{我懂了。}
#{1202}{}{I don't want to listen to you anymore, goodbye.}
{1202}{}{我不想再听你的了，再见。}
#{1250}{}{And you can't say that Jess, the head of the infirmary, is a helpful person. When I asked her for some eye drops I had to wait for an eternity, because wounded soldiers were more important to her!}
{1250}{}{你不能说医务室主任杰西是个乐于助人的人。当我向她要点眼药水时，我不得不等很久，因为受伤的士兵对她更重要！}
#{1251}{}{I see.}
{1251}{}{我懂了。}
#{1252}{}{I don't want to listen to you anymore, goodbye.}
{1252}{}{我不想再听你的了，再见。}
#{1300}{}{Ah, I got angry again. As I can see, you won't give me a minute of peace, so I'm going to the room that I'll have to myself. Goodbye.}
{1300}{}{啊，我又生气了。如我所见，你不会给我一分钟的安宁，所以我要去我自己的房间。再见。}
#{1301}{}{Goodbye.}
{1301}{}{再见。}
#{1350}{}{You're unbelievable! As if it wasn't enough, you're not going to leave me in peace.}
{1350}{}{你真是难以置信！好像这还不够，你不会让我安静下来的。}
#{1351}{}{I'm looking for you, Erick, because the guards have reported that there are some problems with your access card. I have to take care of it.}
{1351}{}{我在找你，埃里克，因为警卫报告说你的门禁卡有问题。我得照顾它。}
#{1352}{}{Are you going to spend all your free time here?}
{1352}{}{你打算把所有的空闲时间都花在这里吗？}
#{1353}{}{When are you planning to go to get some sleep in your room?}
{1353}{}{你打算什么时候去你的房间睡觉？}
#{1354}{}{What exactly are you doing down there on the red levels?}
{1354}{}{你到底在红层下面干什么？}
#{1355}{}{OK. Goodbye.}
{1355}{}{好 啊。再见。}
#{1356}{}{Ugh.}
{1356}{}{啊。}
#{1400}{}{I'd like to have my access card back, if it's already taken care of.}
{1400}{}{我想拿回我的门禁卡，如果它已经处理好了的话。}
#{1401}{}{Ehm... I'm working on it.}
{1401}{}{嗯。。。我正在努力。}
#{1402}{}{Ugh.}
{1402}{}{啊。}
#{1450}{}{Why are you disturbing me?! This room is booked only for me, get out at once!}
{1450}{}{你为什么打扰我？！这个房间只给我订的，马上出去！}
#{1451}{}{I want your access card.}
{1451}{}{我要你的通行证。}
#{1452}{}{I'm sorry, goodbye.}
{1452}{}{对不起，再见。}
#{1453}{}{Ugh.}
{1453}{}{啊。}
#{1500}{}{That's nonsense! I'm not allowed to give you my access card, you should know that.}
{1500}{}{胡说八道！我不能给你我的通行证，你应该知道的。}
#{1501}{}{I know that, that's why I'm going to kill you first and then I'm going to take the card.}
{1501}{}{我知道，这就是为什么我要先杀了你，然后拿牌。}
#{1502}{}{I see, I'm sorry then. Goodbye.}
{1502}{}{我明白了，我很抱歉。再见。}
#{1550}{}{I see, you're the result of our acceptance of everybody, regardless of their usefulness. Don't waste my precious time, get lost.}
{1550}{}{我明白了，你是我们接受每个人的结果，不管他们有多有用。别浪费我宝贵的时间，滚开。}
#{1551}{}{Ugh.}
{1551}{}{啊。}
#{1552}{}{Gaarh!}
{1552}{}{加尔！}
