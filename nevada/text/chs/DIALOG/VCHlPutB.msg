#{100}{}{You see a resident.}
{100}{}{你去看住院医生。}
#{101}{}{You see a local resident. He looks somewhat unhealthy.}
{101}{}{你看到一个当地居民。他看起来有点不健康。}
#{102}{}{Oh, I feel so bad... Why there is no doctor?}
{102}{}{哦，我感觉很糟...为什么没有医生？}
#{103}{}{Symptoms of this patient are somewhat confusing. You are not skilled enough to make sense out of them.}
{103}{}{这个病人的症状有些混乱。你没有足够的技能去理解他们。}
#{104}{}{Everything is that bad, huh?}
{104}{}{一切都那么糟糕，是吗？}
#{105}{}{It seems that this person suffers from intoxication.}
{105}{}{这个人好像喝醉了。}
#{106}{}{Hey, Doc, can it be cured?}
{106}{}{嘿，医生，能治好吗？}
#{107}{}{Thanks, Doc.}
{107}{}{谢谢，医生。}
#{108}{}{You already diagnosed this patient: narcotic intoxication.}
{108}{}{你已经诊断出这个病人：麻醉性中毒。}
#{110}{}{Are you really a doctor? Can you cure me?}
{110}{}{你真的是医生吗？你能治好我吗？}
#{111}{}{Firstly I need to know what drug you have taken.}
{111}{}{首先我要知道你吃了什么药。}
#{112}{}{I'm afraid it will remain your problem until I can figure out a solution.}
{112}{}{在我想出解决办法之前，恐怕这仍然是你的问题。}
#{113}{}{The drugs?! From where!? And recently I only ate some local food from the bar downstairs. Well, and booze, of course. They decided to poison their clients? This is rather strange.}
{113}{}{毒品？！从哪里来！？最近我只吃了楼下酒吧的本地菜。当然还有酒。他们决定毒死他们的客户？这很奇怪。}
#{114}{}{Okay, I see. Someone had added some drugs into your booze to cause the addiction, probably. This can be compensated only by other drugs or by withdrawal and "the shakes".}
{114}{}{好吧，我明白了。可能是有人在你的酒里加了些药导致上瘾。这只能通过其他药物或通过停药和“摇晃”来补偿。}
#{115}{}{Hmm, a hard case. There is no other way except using side chemicals. But nothing comes to my mind now. When I come up with a solution I'll visit you.}
{115}{}{嗯，一个很难的案子。除了使用副化学品外，没有其他方法。但我现在什么也没想到。当我想出解决办法的时候，我会去拜访你。}
#{116}{}{The shakes? How could that happen! Oh... And what kind of drugs?}
{116}{}{震动？怎么会这样！哦...什么样的药？}
#{117}{}{Psycho. Yes, I won't hide it from you, you can become an addict, but before that it will remove all the current negative effects.}
{117}{}{心理。是的，我不会瞒着你，你可以成为一个瘾君子，但在此之前，它会消除所有目前的负面影响。}
#{118}{}{Anti-smoker would compensate the effects of the drug and smooth out the shakes.}
{118}{}{禁烟者会补偿药物的作用，消除震动。}
#{119}{}{You'd better go through 'the shakes' stage. Speaking as a medical doctor. Drugs are too dangerous because you can become an addict. Or even worse.}
{119}{}{你最好经历一下摇摇晃晃的阶段。以医生的身份说话。毒品太危险了，因为你可能会上瘾。甚至更糟。}
#{120}{}{Really? Hell, I'd give all my money for the dose, if that would help! But where can I get it? Doc, don't you have one lying around, huh?}
{120}{}{真正地？见鬼，如果这有帮助的话，我会把我所有的钱都给你的！但我在哪能买到？医生，你身边没有吗？}
#{121}{}{Sure. But not so fast, money in advance. $500 will be enough.}
{121}{}{当然。但不要那么快，提前付钱。500美元就够了。}
#{122}{}{I do. And keep your money to yourself.}
{122}{}{我愿意。把钱留给自己。}
#{123}{}{I don't have it. Yet.}
{123}{}{我没有。但是。}
#{124}{}{Well, thank you. [takes a dose] Wow... Really... I'm starting to feel so good... All the body is getting so obedient...}
{124}{}{好吧，谢谢你。[服了一剂]哇...真正地...我开始感觉很好...所有的身体都变得如此顺从...}
#{125}{}{Yeah. Get well.}
{125}{}{是 啊。好起来。}
#{126}{}{Sure. But not so fast, money in advance. $200 will be enough.}
{126}{}{当然。但不要那么快，提前付钱。200美元就够了。}
#{127}{}{Damn, this is going to be a hot night... But since the doctor says so, then so be it. I'll try to endure.}
{127}{}{该死，今晚会很热...但既然医生这么说，那就顺其自然吧。我会努力忍受的。}
#{128}{}{Great. Moisten your sheet with water, make a gag and put it in your mouth so your teeth won't be damaged. And also... Be well.}
{128}{}{伟大的。用水弄湿床单，塞住嘴放进嘴里，这样牙齿就不会受损。而且...好好的。}
