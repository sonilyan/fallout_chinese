{100}{}{You have my thanks for helping us fight those deathclaws! Let me introduce myself, I'm Noel.}
{101}{}{Nice to meet you Noel. What do you do here?}
#
{102}{}{I used to work here, watching the brahmin... Now, with the deathclaw threat finally gone... I hope gone for
 good, I wanted to try something else instead.}
{103}{}{Like what?}
{104}{}{I'm sure you'll be just fine here. See you later.}
#like?
{105}{}{I was thinking about leaving this place... When my father died almost ten years ago, I had no money so I
 started working here. First as a miner, later, went here and there to earn a living. Life taught me that nothing is for
 granted and I realized it shortly after my old man was killed...}
{106}{}{Uh... I'm sorry, you know who did it?}
{107}{}{Sad story but I don't have time for this.}
#who did it...
{108}{}{Well, I try not to think about it but, on the other hand, I have wanted revenge ever since. If those bastards are
 still out there, I'll find them and make them pay. As soon as I leave this place I'm on my way through the wasteland.}
{109}{}{So, where are you going?}
{110}{}{It could be dangerous out there, are you sure it's a safe place to wander around?}
{111}{}{I wish you luck. Some other time, Noel.}
#going?
{112}{}{I don't know, away from here I guess. Why are you asking?}
{113}{}{Maybe you could come with me and find whoever did that to your father.}
{114}{}{Nothing, I thought to give you some directions but since you don't know where you want to go, I'll leave you be.}
#safe place?
{115}{}{I can find my way... I've been in the wasteland since my early days. My father taught me well how to handle
 pistols and rifles, so I have no doubts in my skills. You can trust me on that.}
{116}{}{You know, I could use someone like you. I travel a lot so there's a chance we may find whoever did that to
 your father, want to join me?}
{117}{}{It's good to know. I have to go now.}
#join me?
{118}{}{Sure, why not! We will stand a better chance if we work together.}
{119}{}{That's what I was hoping for, let's go.}
{120}{}{Actually, I'm having second thoughts about this. I'll come back later.}
#Noel in party!!
{121}{}{Yes, what do you want?}
{122}{}{Tell me a bit about yourself.}
{123}{}{Let's talk about your gear.}
{124}{}{I want to change our formation.}
{125}{}{Put your weapon away.}
{126}{}{I need you to remove the armor you're wearing.}
{127}{}{Wait here until I come back.}
{128}{}{Sorry, nothing.}
#about yourself...
{129}{}{I have learned a lot about living in the wasteland during my childhood. But ever since my father died, I spent
 most of my time working. However, I didn't get any satisfaction because I knew the one thing that once made me
 happy, traveling... Just like my father.}
{130}{}{Thanks for the story, let me ask you something.}
{131}{}{That's it for now, let's get going.}
#gear...
{132}{}{Sure, what do you want?}
{133}{}{I need to know what weapons you can use.}
{134}{}{Put your weapon away.}
{135}{}{Actually, there's nothing I need right now.}
#weapons use...
{136}{}{Small arms, rifles... But I prefer long range weapons, like snipers, hunting rifles and such.}
{137}{}{Alright, let me ask you something else.}
{138}{}{OK, that's all I wanted to know.}
#weapon away, armor away...
{139}{}{Sure thing, anything else?}
{140}{}{No, that's all.}
#formation
{141}{}{Sure, what's on your mind?}
{142}{}{Stay close to me.}
{143}{}{Don't get too close to me.}
{144}{}{Keep some distance between us.}
{145}{}{Nevermind, let me ask you something.}
{146}{}{Actually nothing at the moment.}
#after 142,143,144...
{147}{}{No problem. Anything else?}
{148}{}{No, that's all.}
#wait here... in populated area
{149}{}{Alright, I'll wait here.}
{150}{}{Sure thing. But don't make me wait for too long.}
{151}{}{I'll be back shortly.}
#go...
{152}{}{I'm ready to go, how about you?}
{153}{}{OK, let's go.}
{154}{}{Not just yet.}
#after 104
{155}{}{Hello again, how is it going?}
{156}{}{}
#let's go 2
{157}{}{Is there anything I can help you with before we go?}
#dude doesn't have time for Noels talk...
{158}{}{Hello there.}
{159}{}{Don't bother me.}
{160}{}{I'm sure you have something else to do.}
{161}{}{I'm fine, so leave me alone.}
{162}{}{}
#
{163}{}{Hey.}
{164}{}{Yes?}
{165}{}{You want something?}
{166}{}{Sorry, I can't help you.}
{167}{}{I'm busy here.}

#wait here... random map 03.09.2023
{168}{}{Are you kidding me, in the middle of nowhere? I'll head back to Canville, wait for you there.}
{169}{}{Sure thing.}
{170}{}{Actually, I've changed my mind.}
