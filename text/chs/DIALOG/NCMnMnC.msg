#{100}{}{You see Mrs. Clover.}
{100}{}{你看到克洛弗太太了。}
#{101}{}{You see Mrs. Clover. She's not quite elderly, but is beginning to "dry".}
{101}{}{你看到克洛弗太太了。她年纪不大，但已开始“干涸”。}
#{110}{}{You! Again!? Leave me alone! I gave you all I've had! If you come again, why - I might just show you what this old lady can do!}
{110}{}{你！再一次！？别管我！我把我所有的都给了你！如果你再来，为什么-我可以让你看看这位老太太能干什么！}
#{111}{}{I think you got me confused with someone.}
{111}{}{我想你把我和某人搞混了。}
#{112}{}{Shut it, hag! I don't give a shit about your problems.}
{112}{}{闭嘴，女巫！我才不管你的问题呢。}
#{113}{}{Oh... Sorry! I thought you were from the casino. Those bouncers have such cold hearts that they aren't afraid of putting some force on someone like me!}
{113}{}{哦。。。对不起的！我以为你是赌场的。那些保镖的心很冷，他们不怕给我这样的人施加压力！}
#{114}{}{The bouncers? What's going on?}
{114}{}{保镖？发生什么事？}
#{115}{}{What happened?}
{115}{}{怎么搞的？}
#{116}{}{I'm not interested. I think I'll go now.}
{116}{}{我不感兴趣。我想我现在要走了。}
#{117}{}{You... I thought it was the bouncers again.}
{117}{}{你。。。我还以为又是保镖呢。}
#{118}{}{I'm so glad to see a friendly face...}
{118}{}{我很高兴看到一张友好的脸。。。}
#{119}{}{Misfortune struck me. My husband passed away, and then it turned out he had debts to the casino. Now I'll either be evicted or sold into slavery.}
{119}{}{不幸降临在我身上。我丈夫去世了，后来发现他欠赌场的债。现在我要么被驱逐要么被卖为奴隶。}
#{120}{}{Sorry, but who are you?}
{120}{}{对不起，你是谁？}
#{121}{}{If they're your husband's debts, why are you being punished?}
{121}{}{如果是你丈夫的债务，你为什么要受到惩罚？}
#{122}{}{How did your husband die?}
{122}{}{你丈夫怎么死的？}
#{123}{}{How much does your husband owe?}
{123}{}{你丈夫欠你多少钱？}
#{124}{}{And nobody came to your defense?}
{124}{}{没人为你辩护？}
#{125}{}{I'd like to help you with that debt.}
{125}{}{我想帮你还债。}
#{126}{}{This is none of my business. I think I'll be going now.}
{126}{}{这不关我的事。我想我要走了。}
#{127}{}{Tell me what happened again.}
{127}{}{告诉我又发生了什么事。}
#{128}{}{That's nice, I need to go now.}
{128}{}{太好了，我得走了。}
#{129}{}{Goodbye.}
{129}{}{再见。}
#{130}{}{Mrs. Clover, if you want to know. I work at a kitchen in a local restaurant.}
{130}{}{克洛弗太太，如果你想知道的话。我在当地一家餐馆的厨房工作。}
#{131}{}{The bouncers don't care. They just want their money. With my husband dead, they settle on getting it from me. Such are the injustices of this world.}
{131}{}{保镖不在乎。他们只是想要他们的钱。我丈夫死了，他们决定从我这里得到。这就是这个世界的不公正。}
#{132}{}{Street kids jumped him when he was drunk. Must've been easy prey for them.}
{132}{}{他喝醉了，街上的小孩就把他揍了一顿。一定是他们的猎物。}
#{133}{}{I have a thousand left to pay. Even if I didn't need to pay rent, it would take a few weeks to earn that much. And with the way things are going, I doubt I'll have that long.}
{133}{}{我还有一千英镑要付。即使我不需要付房租，也需要几个星期才能挣到那么多钱。就目前的情况来看，我怀疑我能坚持那么久。}
#{134}{}{While I'm here, Mr. Wright won't let anything happen to me. I'm one of his most reliable tenants. But I doubt this will be able to go on any longer. He won't go against the casinos just for my rent. He'll just evict me and give this room to somebody else. And as soon as that happens... I'm easy prey for the bouncers. I think they'll sell me into slavery.}
{134}{}{我在这儿的时候，莱特先生不会让我出事的。我是他最可靠的房客之一。但我怀疑这种情况还能继续下去。他不会为了我的房租就去赌场。他会把我赶出去，把这个房间给别人。一旦发生这种情况。。。我很容易成为保镖的猎物。我想他们会把我卖了当奴隶。}
#{135}{}{You want to help? That's wonderful! But I have nothing to repay you with.}
{135}{}{你想帮忙吗？太棒了！但我没有什么可以报答你的。}
#{136}{}{Single time payouts aren't the best prospect in Reno. I hope my help will be a long-term investment.}
{136}{}{在里诺，一次性付款并不是最好的前景。我希望我的帮助是长期的投资。}
#{137}{}{Then why am I wasting me time here? I'm leaving.}
{137}{}{那我为什么在这里浪费时间？我要走了。}
#{138}{}{I need to know more about the problem before we continue.}
{138}{}{在我们继续之前，我需要更多地了解这个问题。}
#{139}{}{Got it. Well, enough of this sad talk - I need to go now.}
{139}{}{知道了。好了，别说这些伤心的话了-我得走了。}
#{140}{}{Thank you for your honesty, I didn't expect any more. But listen - my house belongs to Mister Wright and I work for the Silver Legacy hotel. Perhaps helping me will improve your reputation in this area. All that's left for me is to hope for your help. Talk to the administrator in El Dorado - he has all the ledgers.}
{140}{}{谢谢你的诚实，我再也没想到了。但是听着，我的房子是莱特先生的，我在银遗产酒店工作。也许帮助我能提高你在这方面的声誉。我只希望得到你的帮助。和埃尔多拉多的管理员谈谈-他有所有的账本。}
#{141}{}{I'll see the administrator.}
{141}{}{我去见管理员。}
#{150}{}{Glad to see you.}
{150}{}{见到你很高兴。}
#{151}{}{Here's the administrator's ledger. You owe them nothing now.}
{151}{}{这是管理员的账本。你现在什么都不欠他们。}
#{152}{}{Goodbye.}
{152}{}{再见。}
#{153}{}{You did it!? Incredible! I don't know how to thank you. Just know that this won't be left unnoticed by the other residents of these slums. Thank you. Here, take this at least. Something to eat before the road. Special recipe, nobody else makes it!}
{153}{}{你做到了！？简直 不可思议！我不知道该怎么感谢你。要知道，这些贫民窟的其他居民不会忽视这一点。非常感谢。给，至少拿着这个。路上吃点东西。特别配方，没人做！}
#{154}{}{Thank you and goodbye.}
{154}{}{谢谢，再见。}
#{155}{}{Speaking of, your husband was quite a good player. How did someone like him lose that much money?}
{155}{}{说起来，你丈夫是个很好的球员。像他这样的人怎么会损失这么多钱？}
#{156}{}{I can tell you, can't I? Those cunning bastards at the casino cheat with weighted dice. The house always wins, right? He knew, but continued testing his luck. He thought he could beat their system and get lucky... [she sighs] He didn't.}
{156}{}{我可以告诉你，不是吗？赌场里那些狡猾的混蛋用重骰子作弊。房子总是赢的，对吧？他知道，但继续考验他的运气。他认为他可以打败他们的系统，得到幸运。。。他没有。}
#{157}{}{Yeah, the gambling is like that. Well, see you, Mrs. Clover.}
{157}{}{是啊，赌博就是这样。再见，克洛弗太太。}
#{160}{}{I'm looking for workers from Uranium City. Do you know anything about that?}
{160}{}{我在找铀城的工人。你知道吗？}
#{161}{}{Yes, of course. Talk like that spreads quickly around here. Carl is a neighbour of mine. Michael got tossed out into the streets by Wright's men and Joseph was sold into slavery. Seeing a man of such high status suddenly reduced to nothing... It was terrifying.}
{161}{}{是的，当然。这样的话在这里很快就传开了。卡尔是我的邻居。迈克尔被赖特的人扔到街上，约瑟夫被卖为奴隶。看到一个地位这么高的人突然化为乌有。。。太可怕了。}
#{162}{}{Did you hear anything about Ted Bundy?}
{162}{}{你听说泰德・邦迪的事了吗？}
#{163}{}{No. Who is he? If he lived here before I moved in, my neighbours might know. They were here for much longer than me.}
{163}{}{不，他是谁？如果他在我搬进来之前住在这里，我的邻居可能知道。他们在这里的时间比我长得多。}
#{164}{}{What can you tell me about Harding?}
{164}{}{关于哈丁你能告诉我什么？}
#{165}{}{Quiet fella. A little slow, I think. That's why he's always tossed around. From one angle, it's sad. But from the other, it's his own fault that he can't find his own place in society. If you want to know what I think - he didn't get enough human attention in his life. Especially from girls. [she winks] You know what I'm talking about.}
{165}{}{安静的家伙。我觉得有点慢。所以他总是东倒西歪。从一个角度来说，这是可悲的。但从另一方面来说，他在社会上找不到自己的位置是他自己的错。如果你想知道我是怎么想的-他一生中没有得到足够的关注。尤其是女孩。你知道我在说什么。}
#{166}{}{What do you know about the missing prospectors? Mark and Gate.}
{166}{}{你对失踪的探矿者了解多少？标记和门。}
#{167}{}{I heard about that. Both of them, just gone. Not surprising, considering their job isn't the safest - walking around ruins with those things. I remember Mark returned though, caught a glimpse of him through the window late in the evening. I have no idea what happened though.}
{167}{}{我听说了。他们两个，都走了。不足为奇，考虑到他们的工作不是最安全的――带着这些东西在废墟上走来走去。不过，我记得马克回来时，深夜透过窗户瞥见了他一眼。我不知道发生了什么。}
#{168}{}{Another question.}
{168}{}{另一个问题。}
#{169}{}{That's all I wanted to know.}
{169}{}{我只想知道这些。}
#{1136}{}{Did I say anything about pay? I want to deal with this situation because it isn't fair!}
{1136}{}{我有没有说工资的事？我想处理这种情况，因为这不公平！}
