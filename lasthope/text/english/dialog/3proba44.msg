{100}{}{Hello. You are new here, right?}
{101}{}{Yup, what do you do here?}
{102}{}{Who are you?}
{103}{}{Yes, and... see you later.}
# again...
{104}{}{You want to talk about something?}
{105}{}{Yup, what do you do here?}
{106}{}{Who are you?}
{107}{}{Not right now.}
#what do you do here...
{108}{}{I'm, uh, working here... I remember it had something to do with the ventilation system... If you see any broken
 air vents, it means I'm still on the job! [He laughs.]}
{109}{}{So, what's the story?}
{110}{}{Have a nice day. [Leave.]}
#story...
{111}{}{It's not a story, it's a fact. The administration doesn't have the money to pay for the parts and so we are where
 we are now. No matter how much time I spend cleaning them, those vents rust and make more mess every time.}
{112}{}{So, rusty vents are giving you a real headache?}
#
{113}{}{You bet. And it's not the only problem. Less "fresh" air is coming from the surface. When fumes and
 moisture build up they sometimes form a mist... you can't even see the end of the hall. Some of us were using
 environmental armors, but those were quickly withdrawn because of expenses. Those bastards from the top figured it's
 cheaper to keep us down here in this "gas chamber" than replace the damn air filters...}
{114}{}{That means the only way out is raising money for air vent parts?}
#
{115}{}{You are damn right about that one. We are in desperate need for money.}
{116}{}{How much money are we talking about?}
#
{117}{}{About $5000 if my calculations are right. We just need to replace some filters in the more critical areas. After
 that the carbon dioxide and other toxic fume levels in the air will drop eventually. Why are you asking?}
{118}{}{Maybe I can help you to collect the money.}
{119}{}{I just wanted to know how bad it is. Let me ask you something else.}
#help you...
{120}{}{I'm sure you want, like everybody else in here. But guess what, we don't have a dime in our pockets.
 The administration got all the money. All we get is food, some medications... Enough to survive, but not very
 generously.}
{121}{}{I understand and I'll try to get some money.}
#
{122}{}{That would be great! I'll see if I can gather something here. Good luck, you'll need it.}
{123}{}{Thanks.}
#who are you...
{124}{}{I'm Dave. I work here. I mean, what else can I do here?}
{125}{}{Nothing, I suppose. Let me ask you something else.}
#
{126}{}{Sure thing. Speak the word.}
#
{127}{}{About that money for the vents...}
#
{128}{}{How much do you have?}
{129}{}{Still not enough, I'm sorry.}
{130}{}{I got $5000 right here. So what's the plan?}
#
{131}{}{I managed to collect a little something myself. You give me yours and I'll speak with Leonard at once.}
{132}{}{Alright, here you go.}
{133}{}{I'm not sure I want to give my money to a stranger.}
#here you go...
{134}{}{[You wait for a while and Dave approaches soon after.] Great news I tell you. Leonard was surprised about
 how we managed to collect so much money and immediately agreed to buy us new parts for those vents. Isn't that
 great? Within a week or two everybody should be feeling much better. We owe you man. Anything you need, I will
 help you.}
{135}{}{Thanks. I was glad to help.}
#to a stranger...
{136}{}{No offense, but we are all in the same hole. Suit yourself.}
{137}{}{[Leave.]}
#
{138}{}{I'm doing just fine, friend. As I promised, I offer you my help whenever you need it. So, can I do something
 for you?}
