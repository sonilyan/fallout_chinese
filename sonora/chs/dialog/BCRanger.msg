# Before receiving the quest
### {200}{}{Hello}
{200}{}{你好}
### {201}{}{Bye}
{201}{}{再见}
### {202}{}{[Cheat: get out of the pueblo, ranger]}
{202}{}{[骗子：离开普韦布洛，护林员]}
### {203}{}{[Cheat: you won]}
{203}{}{[作弊：你赢了]}
### {204}{}{[Cheat: give a quest to eliminate missionaries]}
{204}{}{[作弊：寻求消灭传教士]}

### {210}{}{So. Wait a minute. Who are you? Of the missionaries?}
{210}{}{所以，等一下。你是谁？传教士？}
### {211}{}{No, just a traveler. And I'm already leaving.}
{211}{}{不，只是一个旅行者。我已经要走了。}
### {212}{}{No, no, I'm from a ruined village in the northwest.}
{212}{}{不，不，我来自西北部一个破败的村庄。}
### {213}{}{A village? There are few settlements there. It looks like you're just lying.}
{213}{}{一个村庄？那里几乎没有定居点。看起来你只是在撒谎。}
### {214}{}{I'm telling you... It doesn't matter. Where are you from?}
{214}{}{我告诉你。。。没关系。你是哪里人？}
### {215}{}{Let it remain a secret. Better take care of yourself.}
{215}{}{让它保持秘密。最好照顾好自己。}
### {216}{}{See you, stranger.}
{216}{}{再见，陌生人。}
### {217}{}{If so, then what?}
{217}{}{如果是，那怎么办？}
### {218}{}{I don't like you. Like everyone else who came from the east. If I find out that you are a spy of the missionaries, you will immediately get a bullet in the forehead.}
{218}{}{我不喜欢你。和其他来自东方的人一样。如果我发现你是传教士的间谍，你的前额马上就会中弹。}
### {219}{}{The chiefs let me in.}
{219}{}{酋长们让我进去了。}
### {220}{}{Your happiness. I wouldn't do that in their place.}
{220}{}{你的幸福。我不会代替他们那样做。}
### {221}{}{I'm not from the East. And from the northwest.}
{221}{}{我不是东方人。还有来自西北的。}
### {222}{}{See you, stranger.}
{222}{}{再见，陌生人。}
### {223}{}{And why did they let you in? Aren't you a stranger yourself?}
{223}{}{他们为什么让你进来？你自己不是个陌生人吗？}
### {224}{}{Chief Geronimo sent me to you. How can I help?}
{224}{}{杰罗尼莫警长派我来找你。我能帮上什么忙？}
### {225}{}{Well, an extra pair of legs and arms will be very useful.}
{225}{}{好吧，多加一双腿和胳膊会非常有用。}
### {226}{}{If I were him, I wouldn't be in such a hurry. But an extra pair of legs and arms really wouldn't hurt me.}
{226}{}{如果我是他，我就不会这么着急了。但是多一双腿和胳膊真的不会伤害我。}
### {227}{}{Report the situation, Ranger.}
{227}{}{报告情况，游骑兵。}
### {228}{}{Are you Ranger Oscar? General Mossman sent me. He demands a report.}
{228}{}{你是奥斯卡游骑兵吗？莫斯曼将军派我来他要求报告。}
### {229}{}{It's a strange thing. I don't understand why he sent you and not one of the rangers... But the general knows better.}
{229}{}{这是一件奇怪的事情。我不明白他为什么派你而不是一个护林员。。。但将军更清楚。}

### {230}{}{I was sent to San Brahmin to restore order. The tribe is trying to defend its freedom and independence from the Phoenician Empire. The situation is complicated and at any moment it can go from local skirmishes to a state of real war.}
{230}{}{我被派往圣婆罗门以恢复秩序。该部落正试图从腓尼基帝国手中捍卫自己的自由和独立。局势很复杂，随时可能从局部冲突演变成真正的战争状态。}
### {231}{}{Go on.}
{231}{}{继续}
### {232}{}{Get to the point, please.}
{232}{}{请开门见山。}
### {233}{}{A detachment of Phoenicians came from the east. They have set up their camp near the pueblo and are trying to drive the tribe away. They say they want to conclude a trade agreement with them. But this is complete nonsense.}
{233}{}{一支腓尼基人的分遣队从东方来了。他们在普韦布洛附近建立了营地，并试图将部落赶走。他们说他们想和他们达成一项贸易协议。但这完全是无稽之谈。}
### {234}{}{What's wrong?}
{234}{}{怎么了？}
### {235}{}{No empire in history has been so courteous to the locals during the expansion. As soon as the alliance is concluded, the tribe will be disarmed, and the Brahmins will be distributed to those who will obey the will of the emperor.}
{235}{}{历史上没有哪个帝国在扩张期间对当地人如此彬彬有礼。一旦联盟结束，部落将被解除武装，婆罗门将被分配给那些服从皇帝意志的人。}
### {236}{}{[Listen]}
{236}{}{[听]}
### {237}{}{The Phoenix cannot be trusted. It's a bunch of adventurers and bandits. The townspeople simply do not know any other life. And the tribe of cattle breeders has been creating its own culture and traditions for generations. It is impossible for some greedy rich people from the city to ruin their lives.}
{237}{}{凤凰是不可信任的。这是一群冒险家和土匪。镇上的人根本不了解其他的生活。养牛部落几代人以来一直在创造自己的文化和传统。城里的一些贪婪的富人不可能毁了他们的生活。}
### {238}{}{Clearly. Do you want to drive the missionaries back to the city?}
{238}{}{清晰地你想把传教士赶回城里吗？}
### {239}{}{Our forces are unequal to go into open battle. And within the tribe, a split is maturing, which was generated by the Phoenicians among the youth. Help prepare a squad to expel the missionaries. It is necessary to heal the wounded and to reason with the son of Chief Chatto.}
{239}{}{我们的部队不适合公开作战。在部落内部，分裂正在成熟，这是腓尼基人在年轻人中产生的。帮助准备驱逐传教士的队伍。有必要医治伤员，并与查特酋长的儿子讲理。}
### {240}{}{Okay. I'll see what I can do.}
{240}{}{可以我看看我能做些什么。}
### {241}{}{I doubt your squad can handle it. I'll try to find another way.}
{241}{}{我怀疑你们的队伍能应付得了。我会想办法的。}

### {242}{}{Hello, sectarian. What are you counting on? Oh, I know - for a bullet in the forehead.}
{242}{}{你好，宗派主义者。你指望什么？哦，我知道――因为前额中了一颗子弹。}
### {243}{}{Wait a minute...}
{243}{}{等一下。。。}
### {244}{}{What are you...}
{244}{}{你是什么。。。}
### {245}{}{Get out! So that your spirit will not be on the land of cattle breeders. You, Aaron's henchmen, were not invited here.}
{245}{}{滚出去！这样，你的灵就不在养牛的地上。你，亚伦的党羽，没有被邀请来这里。}
### {246}{}{Okay... calm down... I'm leaving.}
{246}{}{可以冷静我要走了。}
### {247}{}{A ranger? What a pleasant surprise. The General Staff did not warn me about your appointment. Are you here of your own free will?}
{247}{}{护林员？多么令人愉快的惊喜啊。总参谋部没有就你的任命向我发出警告。你是自愿来的吗？}
### {248}{}{No, I'm just passing by. What's going on here? Do you need help?}
{248}{}{不，我只是路过。这是怎么回事？你需要帮助吗？}
### {249}{}{Just along the way. Sorry, I have to move on soon. Maybe we'll meet again.}
{249}{}{就在路上。对不起，我很快就要离开了。也许我们还会再见面。}

### {250}{}{Didn't they tell you to get out of the pueblo? If you continue to resist, I will have to use force to drive you away from this holy land.}
{250}{}{他们不是叫你离开普韦布洛吗？如果你继续抵抗，我将不得不使用武力将你从这片圣地赶走。}
### {251}{}{It was a mistake. Give me a chance, I'll fix it!}
{251}{}{这是一个错误。给我一个机会，我会解决的！}
### {252}{}{You have no power here. You're as much an outsider as I am. So sit tight and keep quiet.}
{252}{}{你在这里没有权力。你和我一样都是局外人。所以坐好，保持安静。}
### {253}{}{I bet my hat-you can't drive me away. What is it, stupid? Are your fingers itching already? So come on! Get out your revolver, you son of a bitch!}
{253}{}{我打赌你不会把我赶走的。这是什么，笨蛋？你的手指已经发痒了吗？所以加油！拿出你的左轮手枪，你这个婊子养的！}
### {254}{}{Let's discuss the action plan again. What needs to be done?}
{254}{}{让我们再次讨论行动计划。需要做什么？}

### {260}{}{Leave the pueblo immediately. Commander Crook gives you one last chance to avoid the death penalty.}
{260}{}{立即离开普韦布洛。克鲁克指挥官给了你最后一次避免死刑的机会。}
### {261}{}{I can't be intimidated by death. I went on this mission fully aware of the risks. But my goal is higher than my life. I tried to save the tribe from extermination or enslavement by imperial troops.}
{261}{}{我不能被死亡吓倒。我在执行这项任务时充分意识到了风险。但我的目标比我的生活更高。我试图拯救这个部落，使其免遭帝国军队的灭绝或奴役。}
### {262}{}{It's over. The elders advocate a truce with the missionaries.}
{262}{}{一切都结束了。长老们主张与传教士停战。}
### {263}{}{I see. The missionaries have completely clouded their minds. There is no sadder sight than the powerlessness of power.}
{263}{}{我明白了。传教士们的思想完全模糊了。没有什么比权力的无能为力更可悲的了。}
### {264}{}{Now the majority is against you. So are you going to leave?}
{264}{}{现在大多数人都反对你。你打算离开吗？}
### {265}{}{I'll have to go back to base with nothing. But don't think the Rangers will just let it go. The Phoenix Empire cannot be allowed to sweep away entire nations in its path for the sake of power and resources.}
{265}{}{我将不得不一无所有地回到基地。但别以为流浪者队会就此罢休。不能允许凤凰帝国为了权力和资源而横扫其道路上的所有国家。}
### {266}{}{Cheer up. You will still have a chance to take revenge. Probably.}
{266}{}{振作起来你仍然有机会复仇。可能}
### {267}{}{Right. Get out of here.}
{267}{}{正确的离开这里。}
### {268}{}{So you're not going to leave?}
{268}{}{所以你不打算离开？}
### {269}{}{No. I will stay to protect the tribe during the siege. And I won't be alone. There are still people in the tribe who are ready to stand up for themselves.}
{269}{}{不，我会在围攻期间留下来保护部落。我不会孤单。部落中仍然有人准备为自己挺身而出。}
### {270}{}{As you wish. But you've been officially warned.}
{270}{}{如你所愿。但你已经被正式警告了。}
### {271}{}{Do as you like. My job is to warn.}
{271}{}{你想怎么做就怎么做。我的工作是警告。}
### {272}{}{The desert teaches you to hide in the shadows and wait for the right moment to attack. Use this tactic, otherwise you will lose.}
{272}{}{沙漠教会你躲在阴影中，等待合适的时机发动进攻。用这个战术，否则你会输的。}
### {273}{}{Sometimes it is more useful to retreat to gather strength. Isn't that the case?}
{273}{}{有时，撤退以积聚力量更有用。不是这样吗？}
### {274}{}{The Parker Dam was flooded and destroyed. Your command will no longer be able to support the struggle in San Brahmin.}
{274}{}{帕克大坝被洪水淹没并被毁。你的指挥将无法再支持圣婆罗门的斗争。}
### {275}{}{It's over. The Supreme Leader turned away from the Rangers.}
{275}{}{一切都结束了。最高领袖避开了游骑兵队。}

#After receiving the quest
### {300}{}{Report back. Any information about our enemy will be valuable.}
{300}{}{发回报告。任何关于我们敌人的信息都是有价值的。}
### {301}{}{I have nothing to report yet.}
{301}{}{我还没有什么要报告的。}

### {311}{}{We represent Law and Order in these lands.}
{311}{}{我们在这些土地上代表法律与秩序。}
### {312}{}{Do the Rangers have a base?}
{312}{}{游骑兵队有基地吗？}
### {313}{}{The General Staff in the west and many outposts throughout Southern Arizona. But it would be silly to tell you their exact location. }
{313}{}{西部的总参谋部和亚利桑那州南部的许多前哨基地。但如果告诉你他们的确切位置，那就太傻了。}
### {314}{}{The General Staff in the west and many outposts throughout Southern Arizona. But you already know where it is.}
{314}{}{西部的总参谋部和亚利桑那州南部的许多前哨基地。但你已经知道它在哪里了。}
### {315}{}{Where's your badge, Ranger?}
{315}{}{你的徽章在哪里，游骑兵？}
### {316}{}{I removed it only in order not to aggravate the difficult situation. As things get better in Pueblo, the badge will be on my chest again.}
{316}{}{我删除它只是为了不加剧困难的局势。随着普韦布洛的情况好转，徽章将再次出现在我的胸前。}
### {317}{}{I don't understand why the Rangers are getting involved in this war?}
{317}{}{我不明白为什么游骑兵队要卷入这场战争？}
### {318}{}{We have two goals - to make friends with the tribe and stop the expansion of the Phoenix.}
{318}{}{我们有两个目标――与部落交朋友，阻止凤凰的扩张。}
### {319}{}{Isn't the enforcement of the law contrary to the principles of the tribe?}
{319}{}{执行法律难道不违背部落的原则吗？}
### {320}{}{Simple rules are the same for everyone - do not kill for no reason, do not steal someone else's. As for the local foundations, the Rangers have to put up with them and make some adjustments.}
{320}{}{简单的规则对每个人来说都是一样的――不要无故杀人，不要偷别人的。至于当地的基金会，流浪者队必须忍受它们，并做出一些调整。}
### {321}{}{Clear.}
{321}{}{清楚的}

### {330}{}{The missionaries fled back to Phoenix.}
{330}{}{传教士们逃回凤凰城。}
### {331}{}{You have amazing diplomatic skills. I don't know how you managed to sort it out, but I'm very grateful.}
{331}{}{你有惊人的外交技巧。我不知道你是怎么解决的，但我非常感激。}
### {332}{}{It's nothing. They turned out to be quite skittish.}
{332}{}{没什么。事实证明，他们很不听话。}
### {333}{}{It wasn't easy. But our great mission requires sacrifice.}
{333}{}{这并不容易。但我们的伟大使命需要牺牲。}
### {334}{}{General Mossman did not entrust you with such a serious task for nothing. He has a nose for good people. Now I will be able to return to the base after a long and stressful mission.}
{334}{}{莫斯曼将军没有无缘无故地把这么严肃的任务交给你。他喜欢好人。现在，在经历了漫长而紧张的任务后，我将能够返回基地。}
### {335}{}{Good luck, Oscar.}
{335}{}{祝你好运，奥斯卡。}
### {336}{}{The Rangers need people like you. Stop by our base in Parker Dam. I will pass the recommendation on you to the general.}
{336}{}{游骑兵队需要像你这样的人。在我们位于帕克大坝的基地停下来。我将把你的推荐信转交给将军。}
### {337}{}{Thank you, Ranger. I'll be in those parts, I'll definitely look in on the general.}
{337}{}{谢谢你，游骑兵。我会在那些地方，我一定会看看将军。}

### {340}{}{Chatto refused to support the Phoenicians.}
{340}{}{查特拒绝支持腓尼基人。}
### {341}{}{Good news. If Chatto does not create problems, then our chances of winning increase dramatically.}
{341}{}{好消息。如果查特没有制造问题，那么我们获胜的机会就会大大增加。}
### {342}{}{What else needs to be done?}
{342}{}{还需要做什么？}
### {343}{}{It remains to raise the soldiers and go into battle. But some are lying wounded. This scares the cattlemen, besides, some of them could go into battle if they were patched up.}
{343}{}{剩下的就是培养士兵投入战斗。但有些人受伤躺在地上。这吓坏了牛人，此外，如果他们中的一些人打上补丁，他们可能会投入战斗。}
### {344}{}{I'll cure them.}
{344}{}{我会治好他们的。}
### {345}{}{Thank you. A commendable initiative. But if you don't know how to treat people, then at least bring them medicines. Surely something can be stolen from the missionaries.}

### {353}{}{Chatto is no more, he can't interfere with your plans.}
{353}{}{查特不在了，他不能干涉你的计划。}
### {354}{}{This is not good news. Chatto was a leader among the youth and could influence the minds of his fellow tribesmen. It remains to be hoped that none of the dissenters will stand in our way.}
{354}{}{这不是一个好消息。查特是年轻人中的领袖，能够影响部落同胞的思想。我们仍然希望没有一个持不同意见的人会妨碍我们。}
### {355}{}{Then you have no choice. Crook is waiting for your attack. Come on, show me what you're capable of, Ranger!}
{355}{}{那你就别无选择了。克鲁克正在等待你的攻击。来吧，让我看看你的能力，游骑兵！}

### {359}{}{I haven't been able to talk to him yet.}
{359}{}{我还没能和他说话。}

# during the skirmish
### {360}{}{Hmm. It doesn't look like the missionaries are preparing for battle. Their self-confidence is good for us. It's a good time to start the offensive.}
{360}{}{嗯。看起来传教士们并没有在为战斗做准备。他们的自信对我们有好处。现在是开始进攻的好时机。}
### {361}{}{Ranger Oscar, may I conduct a reconnaissance? I'll be back soon.}
{361}{}{游骑兵奥斯卡，我可以进行侦察吗？我很快就会回来。}
