#{601}{}{What is it that you do here?}
{601}{}{你在这里做什么？}
#{650}{}{I'm the chief physician and head of research of the Hunters. This means I take care that the medical ward runs smoothly. Encounters between our warriors and groups of the Rebirth are quite common, providing for a lot of wounds to treat. It is also my responsibility to supervise and lead all research. I personally partake in the research of the anti-mutant virus and of implants to improve human abilities.}
{650}{}{我是猎手的主任医师和研究主管。这意味着我要注意病房的运转。我们的战士和重生的团体之间的遭遇是相当普遍的，提供了许多伤口来治疗。我也有责任监督和领导所有的研究。我个人参与了抗突变病毒和提高人类能力的植入物的研究。}

#{754}{}{Thank you for the information.}

#{800}{}{I'm not satisfied. The subject died only fifteen seconds after inhalation. Even though he was in severe pain in just four seconds, he would still be able to actively defend himself.}
{800}{}{我不满意。受试者吸入后仅15秒死亡。即使他在短短4秒钟内剧烈疼痛，他仍能积极自卫。}
#{801}{}{This kind of experiments is disgusting!}

#{851}{}{Bring it on.}
{851}{}{来吧。}
#{900}{}{I decided we should amputate her legs and keep her for observation for some time. However, the doctor performing the surgery proved to be rather inexperienced. The subject died during this elementary surgical procedure. The doctor was immediately sent away and now, he must partake in the defense of the city. This is most unfortunate as able medical staff is hard to find.}
{900}{}{我决定把她的腿截肢，留她观察一段时间。然而，做手术的医生却证明经验不足。受试者在这个初级外科手术过程中死亡。医生立刻被打发走了，现在，他必须参与保卫城市。这是非常不幸的，因为很难找到有能力的医务人员。}

{1005}{}{没什么，对不起。}
#{1050}{}{We modify and improve toxic gases for possible combat use, but our main goal is a virus that would eradicate all mutants but be completely harmless for genetically clean humans.}
{1050}{}{我们对有毒气体进行改造和改良，以备可能的作战用途，但我们的主要目标是研制一种病毒，这种病毒可以消灭所有变种，但对基因清洁的人类完全无害。}
#{1051}{}{Why do you want to kill all mutants?}
{1051}{}{你为什么要杀死所有的变种人？}
#{1052}{}{Is it actually possible to create such a virus?}

{1102}{}{我还有一些问题。}
#{1103}{}{That's all I need to know.}
{1103}{}{我只想知道这些。}
#{1150}{}{Theoretically, it may well be possible. The virus would have to be able to distinguish a specific genetic information and based on that either kill the subject or keep it unharmed.}
{1150}{}{理论上，这很可能是可能的。病毒必须能够区分特定的基因信息，并以此为基础杀死受试者或使其免受伤害。}
#{1151}{}{The virus could recognize the specific DNA string of a pure human and keep them unharmed. But all others, it would kill.}
{1151}{}{这种病毒能够识别纯人类的特定DNA链，并使他们免受伤害。但其他人都会死。}
#{1152}{}{I have some more questions.}
{1152}{}{我还有一些问题。}
#{1153}{}{That's all I need to know.}
{1153}{}{我只想知道这些。}
#{1200}{}{Furthermore, the virus will have to attach itself only to human glycoproteins and thus avoid all animals. It'll "assess" only humans and their mutated offspring. Pure humans with original, undamaged DNA will be spared, the rest will die. We were able to acquire documentation proving that the United States already had such viruses at their disposal. Unfortunately, these were top-secret projects and we were thus unable to find out more. Now we have to design the virus ourselves.}
{1200}{}{此外，病毒只能附着在人类糖蛋白上，从而避开所有动物。它将只“评估”人类及其突变后代。拥有原始、未受损DNA的纯人类将得以幸免，其余的将死去。我们能够获得文件证明美国已经有了这样的病毒。不幸的是，这些都是绝密项目，因此我们无法找到更多。现在我们必须自己设计病毒。}
#{1201}{}{I have some more questions.}
{1201}{}{我还有一些问题。}
#{1202}{}{That's all I need to know.}
{1202}{}{我只想知道这些。}
#{1250}{}{They make it possible to improve elementary human abilities like strength, agility and the like, without any unwanted mutation, just by simple microscopic implants. Some armies had been performing this type of surgery on their military already before the war. So we merely adjusted the procedure to cover other abilities. However, we don't have the necessary technology at the moment and the project is therefore on hold.}
{1250}{}{它们使得仅仅通过简单的显微植入就可以在没有任何不必要的突变的情况下提高人类的基本能力，如力量、敏捷性等。一些军队在战前就已经对他们的军队进行了这种手术。所以我们只是调整了程序以涵盖其他能力。然而，我们目前没有必要的技术，因此项目被搁置。}
#{1251}{}{In the Dead Quarter they perform surgery to improve elementary human abilities without any problems.}
{1251}{}{在死亡区，他们进行手术，以提高基本的人类能力没有任何问题。}
#{1252}{}{I have some more questions.}
{1252}{}{我还有一些问题。}
#{1253}{}{That's all I need to know.}
{1253}{}{我只想知道这些。}
#{1300}{}{Those people have no honor and neither have you, should you decide to undergo such surgery. To murder one man so that another could gain a slight advantage, that is no progress.}
{1300}{}{如果你决定接受这样的手术，那些人和你都没有荣誉。为了另一个人能得到一点好处而谋杀一个人，那是没有进步的。}
#{1301}{}{Say, do you conduct experiments on living subjects by any chance?}
{1301}{}{喂，你有没有在活体上做实验？}
#{1302}{}{I have some more questions.}
{1302}{}{我还有一些问题。}
#{1303}{}{That's all I need to know.}
{1303}{}{我只想知道这些。}
#{1350}{}{They have no honor, they lack any respect for human life. Patients are merely a commodity to them, or perhaps guinea pigs. Healing is the last thing they think about.}
{1350}{}{他们没有荣誉，他们对人的生命缺乏尊重。病人对他们来说只是一种商品，也许是豚鼠。治愈是他们最不愿考虑的事情。}

{1400}{}{为了你自己的利益，我希望你不要指责我不诚实。我专门研究突变体，我的研究对所有人都有好处。}
#{1401}{}{But mutants are sentient beings, too. To conduct experiments on them is disgusting!}

{1403}{}{哦，那我就去。}
#{1450}{}{I was born in our local Vault, designated by the number 16. It was still closed at that time. But my appearance is different because my ancestors came from a land called Japan.

It was also here that I learned about the mutant threat we have to face not only in military terms but also scientific terms.}
{1500}{}{帝国拥有大量战前知识和技术，但无意进一步发展。我只是一名医生，被禁止从事任何科学研究。因此，我在寻找其他的选择，我在这里找到了它们。我也是在这里了解到我们不仅要面对军事方面的威胁，还要面对科学方面的威胁。}

#{1503}{}{Thank you for your time.}

#{1550}{}{Life in the Imperial City is far too easy, and it was probably like that when the Vault was still closed.

Few people have ever left the Imperial City as "out there", evil things happen.}
{1550}{}{皇城的生活太简单了，金库还关着的时候可能就是这样。人们没有被驱使去发展，他们满足于他们简单、平静的生活，因此他们不知道他们很容易被剥夺这种生活。很少有人离开过皇城作为“外面”，邪恶的事情发生了。}

#{2450}{}{About that, you should rather talk to one of my colleagues on the third floor of the Vault. I devote my time to serious research and think lowly of the use of such genetic creations.}
{2450}{}{关于这个，你应该和我在金库三楼的一个同事谈谈。我把时间花在了认真的研究上，对这种基因创造物的使用却不屑一顾。}
#{2451}{}{Why do you disagree with using aliens?}
{2451}{}{为什么你不同意使用外星人？}
#{2452}{}{I have some more questions.}
{2452}{}{我还有一些问题。}
#{2453}{}{OK.}
{2453}{}{好 啊。}
#{2500}{}{I believe it is a great risk we have no reason to undertake. Aliens have been created as unstoppable killers and could this become a great threat. Perhaps even greater than mutants are at the moment.}
{2500}{}{我认为这是一个我们没有理由承担的巨大风险。外星人被创造成不可阻挡的杀手，这可能成为一个巨大的威胁。也许比目前的变种还要强大。}
#{2501}{}{But they have a genetic clock built into them, they'll all die eventually.}
{2501}{}{但是他们体内有一个基因钟，他们最终都会死。}
#{2502}{}{I have some more questions.}
{2502}{}{我还有一些问题。}
#{2503}{}{OK.}
{2503}{}{好 啊。}
#{2550}{}{Despite what you may have heard about the outpost, the majority of our research takes place here. However, the base outside the city was used for testing the results of our endeavors. There was always an abundance of test subjects, mostly ghouls from the Rebirth that were taken as prisoners.}
{2550}{}{尽管你可能听说过前哨站，我们的大部分研究都发生在这里。然而，城外的基地是用来检验我们的努力成果的。总是有大量的受试者，大部分是重生后被当作囚犯的僵尸。}
#{2551}{}{I have some more questions.}
{2551}{}{我还有一些问题。}
#{2552}{}{Thank you for the clarification.}
{2552}{}{谢谢你的澄清。}

#{2651}{}{I'm just not quite sure how such a small mutation could spread to the people nearby.}
{2651}{}{我只是不太清楚这么小的突变怎么会传播到附近的人身上。}
#{2652}{}{Why are mutants aggressive and incapable of intelligent thought?}
{2652}{}{为什么突变体具有攻击性，不能进行智能思考？}
#{2653}{}{No, let me ask you something else.}
{2653}{}{不，我再问你一件事。}
#{2654}{}{No, goodbye.}
{2654}{}{不，再见。}
#{2700}{}{Just as any other infection, it spreads through the bloodstream and can be passed on to others by physical contact.}
{2700}{}{就像任何其他感染一样，它通过血液传播，可以通过身体接触传染给其他人。}
#{2701}{}{But if the DNA string is damaged by radiation, the missing segments are randomly replaced by complementary bases passing by. The DNA is thus changed but this change quickly stabilizes and cannot spread further.}
{2701}{}{但是如果DNA链被辐射损伤，缺失的片段会被经过的互补碱基随机替换。DNA因此发生了变化，但这种变化很快稳定下来，不能进一步扩散。}
#{2702}{}{That is nonsense!}
{2702}{}{那是胡说八道！}
#{2703}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{2703}{}{我再问你一件事。}
#{2704}{}{I'll be going, then.}
{2704}{}{那我就去。}
#{2750}{}{You imply I'm a liar. I cannot let such an insult go unanswered.}
{2750}{}{你是说我是个骗子。我不能让这样的侮辱置之不理。}
#{2751}{}{Bring it on.}
{2751}{}{来吧。}
#{2800}{}{I must admit it is a pleasure to meet someone who is familiar with my field of expertise. You are right, of course, but if an individual affected by genetic mutation reproduces, the probability of this defect being passed on to their offspring is very high. This would result in an ever-increasing spread of genetic mutations, they would become common and acceptable. Each new mutation, however small, would become accepted and after a few generations, no pure humans would remain.}
{2800}{}{我必须承认，很高兴见到熟悉我专业领域的人。当然，你是对的，但是如果一个受基因突变影响的个体能够繁殖，这种缺陷遗传给后代的概率是非常高的。这将导致越来越多的基因突变的传播，它们将变得普遍和可接受。每一个新的突变，无论多么微小，都会被接受，几代人之后，再也没有纯人类了。}
#{2801}{}{Why the story of the spread of mutation, then?}
{2801}{}{那么，为什么会有突变传播的故事呢？}
#{2850}{}{Not everyone is able to comprehend these facts, but if we promote mutation as an infection, everybody understands. It is not a story, it is a simplified version of reality. The two versions have the same implications ?? we must get rid of all mutations, even small ones. And that is the important thing.}
{2850}{}{不是每个人都能理解这些事实，但如果我们把突变作为一种感染来推广，每个人都能理解。这不是故事，而是现实的简化版。这两个版本有着相同的含义――我们必须消除所有的突变，即使是很小的突变。这才是最重要的。}
#{2851}{}{I beg to differ. People should be told the truth and I'll take care of that.}
{2851}{}{我不敢苟同。应该告诉人们真相，我会处理的。}
#{2852}{}{You are right. Let me ask you something else.}
{2852}{}{你是对的。我再问你一件事。}
#{2853}{}{You are right.}
{2853}{}{你是对的。}
#{2900}{}{I'm terribly sorry, but I'm afraid I cannot allow that.}
{2900}{}{非常抱歉，但恐怕我不能允许。}
#{2901}{}{Try to stop me.}
{2901}{}{试着阻止我。}
#{2950}{}{With the constant outside radiation, some types of cells are burned, mostly the most sensitive ones. This means that sensory and reproductive organs are the most affected and die off. Mutants then become thoughtless animals.}
{2950}{}{在持续的外界辐射下，一些类型的细胞被烧毁，大多数是最敏感的细胞。这意味着感觉器官和生殖器官受到的影响最大，并且会死亡。变种人就变成了没有思想的动物。}
#{2951}{}{There is no proof that the degree of irradiation is directly linked to a decrease in intelligence.}
{2951}{}{没有证据表明辐射程度与智力下降直接相关。}
#{2952}{}{That is nonsense!}
{2952}{}{那是胡说八道！}
#{2953}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{2953}{}{我再问你一件事。}
#{2954}{}{I'll be going, then.}
{2954}{}{那我就去。}
#{3000}{}{Super mutants, the kind most affected by radiation, are direct proof. Their thought processes have been decreased to a bare minimum.}
{3000}{}{超级突变体是受辐射影响最大的一类，是直接的证据。他们的思维过程已经减少到最低限度。}
#{3001}{}{Super mutants can't be the result of a simple exposure to radiation. There must be some additional factor, most probably some sort of virus.}
{3001}{}{超级突变体不可能是简单暴露在辐射下的结果。肯定还有其他因素，很可能是某种病毒。}
#{3002}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{3002}{}{我再问你一件事。}
#{3003}{}{I'll be going, then.}
{3003}{}{那我就去。}
#{3050}{}{In fact, I have had the opportunity to dissect several super mutant subjects and I actually came across the presence of a highly developed virus. I would be most delighted to have such a virus at my disposal. When modified, it could solve our problem with the eradication of mutants once and for all.}
{3050}{}{事实上，我有机会解剖了几个超级突变的研究对象，我发现了一种高度发达的病毒。我将非常高兴有这样的病毒在我的处置。经过改良后，它可以解决我们的问题，一劳永逸地消灭突变体。}
#{3051}{}{Well?}
{3051}{}{好？}
#{3100}{}{I'm genuinely amazed you were able to arrive at this conclusion by mere deduction. I'm saddened that I'll have to have you terminated; despite the fact that the presence of a virus in super mutants does not negate Sebastian's statements concerning other mutants, it could cast a shadow of doubt on his believability. And that would be one great victory for mutants.}
{3100}{}{我真的很惊讶你能仅仅通过推论得出这个结论。我很难过，我将不得不终止你；尽管在超级突变体中存在病毒并不能否定塞巴斯蒂安关于其他突变体的说法，但这可能会给他的可信度蒙上一层怀疑的阴影。这将是突变体的一个伟大胜利。}
#{3101}{}{That won't be necessary. I'm a Hunter and understand that it has to remain secret, if we want to defeat the mutants.}
{3101}{}{那没必要。我是一个猎人，我明白如果我们想打败变种人，就必须保密。}
#{3102}{}{I won't give up that easily!}

#{3300}{}{Life constantly strives to go on. I'm afraid that there are ways their organism could overcome this biological clock.
