#{100}{}{You see a man in immaculate, perfectly maintained armor.}
{100}{}{你看到一个穿着完美盔甲的男人。}
#{150}{}{You see Zachary Browman.}
{150}{}{你看到扎卡里・布劳曼了。}
#{200}{}{You see a perfectly neat man. Even his armor is immaculate.}
{200}{}{你看到一个非常整洁的男人。甚至他的盔甲也完美无缺。}
#{250}{}{You see colonel Zachary Browman, the Imperial army recruitment officer.}
{250}{}{你看到扎卡里・布劳曼上校，帝国军征兵官。}
#{300}{}{There are certain rules of proper conduct we adhere to here. One of them is not walking around with your weapons drawn.}
{300}{}{我们在这里遵守某些行为准则。其中一个不是拿着武器到处走。}
#{301}{}{Leave my computer alone, that's none of your business.}
{301}{}{别碰我的电脑，那不关你的事。}
#{302}{}{Leave my leg alone. It's an old injury that no one can do anything about anymore.}
{302}{}{别碰我的腿。这是一个没有人能再做任何事情的老伤。}
#{500}{}{Greetings. I'm colonel Zachary Browman, recruitment officer. Administrative division of the Imperial Army. What can I do for you?}
{500}{}{问候语。我是扎卡里・布劳曼上校，征兵官。帝国军队的行政区划。有什么事吗？}
#{501}{}{Recruitment officer?}
{501}{}{招聘官？}
#{502}{}{Recoo-whoo?}
{502}{}{雷科哇？}
#{550}{}{Don't you worry about that. Understandably, we only accept dwellers in the Imperial army. All the more so as we recruit them already in early childhood. This way we have enough time to properly shape those young boys and girls.}
{550}{}{别担心。可以理解，我们只接受帝国军队中的居民。更重要的是，我们在幼儿时代就开始招募他们。这样我们就有足够的时间来塑造那些年轻的男孩和女孩。}
#{551}{}{Oh, so you could probably tell me something about Mario Carbone.}
{551}{}{哦，所以你可以告诉我一些关于马里奥・卡本的事。}
#{552}{}{Administrative division? That means you are in fact just a clerk, not a soldier, right?}
{552}{}{行政区划？也就是说你其实只是个办事员，不是军人，对吧？}
#{553}{}{I don't wanna badmouth anyone but you seem much more welcoming that most of the dwellers of the empire.}
{553}{}{我不想说任何人的坏话，但你似乎比帝国的大多数居民都欢迎。}
#{554}{}{What do you know about a boy called Felix Velasquez?}
{554}{}{你对一个叫费利克斯・维拉斯克斯的男孩了解多少？}
#{555}{}{I know all about you, those children and Chuck. He told me everything.}
{555}{}{我知道你的一切，那些孩子和查克。他把一切都告诉了我。}
#{556}{}{I know all about you, those children and Chuck. Perhaps you should know that he's dead.}
{556}{}{我知道你的一切，那些孩子和查克。也许你应该知道他死了。}
#{557}{}{Oh, I guess I'll be going then.}
{557}{}{哦，我想那我就走了。}
#{558}{}{Duh.}
{558}{}{嗯。}
#{600}{}{I believe that the best way to present our civilized society to strangers and outsiders is to show them how we are able to communicate with them. Out there, disputes and misunderstandings are dealt with by force, but not here.}
{600}{}{我相信，向陌生人和局外人展示我们文明社会的最好方式就是向他们展示我们如何与他们交流。在那里，争端和误解是通过武力来解决的，但在这里不是。}
#{601}{}{In other words, you think yourselves superior to anyone else.}
{601}{}{换句话说，你认为自己比别人优越。}
#{602}{}{Oh, great. But I'd rather discuss something else.}
{602}{}{哦，太好了。但我宁愿讨论别的事情。}
#{603}{}{That's all I need to know, goodbye.}
{603}{}{我只想知道这些，再见。}
#{604}{}{Yeah, we kill one another on sight. Here, let me show you!}
{604}{}{是的，我们一看到就互相残杀。来，让我给你看看！}
#{650}{}{It's a fact. But don't get me wrong, I'm not saying we should exterminate you all or even rule you by force. You people from the wasteland can hardly do anything about your limited fate. And that is something no one can change. We were simply lucky that we grew up in a small oasis of the civilized world and the only thing we can do is to preserve it for the generations to come.}
{650}{}{这是事实。但别误会我的意思，我不是说我们应该消灭你们所有人，甚至用武力统治你们。你们这些来自荒原的人对你们有限的命运几乎无能为力。这是任何人都无法改变的。我们很幸运，我们生长在文明世界的一个小绿洲里，我们唯一能做的就是为子孙后代保存它。}
#{651}{}{So the die is cast and we just have to come to terms with it? How lucky you are for rolling boxcars.}
{651}{}{所以这是命中注定的，我们必须接受它？你真幸运，能开着敞篷车。}
#{652}{}{Let's change the subject. I wanted to know something else... }
{652}{}{我们换个话题吧。我想知道别的。。。}
#{653}{}{I'm done talking to you.}
{653}{}{我不想再和你说话了。}
#{700}{}{Of course it is laudable that you're trying to improve your life. But one life is not enough to get to the level of education, manners and lots more of just an average dweller of the empire. You will always be limited by your surrounding. But let's leave the topic, I may have crossed the line there. It was not my intention to make fun of you just because my origin and life is better than yours.}
{700}{}{当然，你在努力改善自己的生活是值得称赞的。但是，一个人的生活不足以达到一个帝国普通居民的教育水平、礼节和更多。你总是受到周围环境的限制。但我们别谈这个话题了，我可能已经越界了。我不想因为我的出身和生活比你好就取笑你。}
#{701}{}{There really is no point talking to you anymore.}
{701}{}{跟你说话真的没有意义了。}
#{750}{}{Hm, Mario Carbone... Yes, I remember him. I recruited him. He gave me the impression that he was the type of person who, once his mind is made up, cannot be stopped by anything. As far as I know, he's doing quit well right now. Normally, they miss their parents in the first few days and weeks, but not him.}
{750}{}{嗯，马里奥・卡本。。。是的，我记得他。我招募了他。他给我的印象是，他是那种一旦下定决心，什么都阻止不了的人。据我所知，他现在做得很好。通常情况下，他们在最初的几天和几周里会想念父母，但不会想念他。}
#{751}{}{Thanks, I'd like to know something else... }
{751}{}{谢谢，我想知道一些别的。。。}
#{752}{}{Thanks for the information, bye.}
{752}{}{谢谢你的消息，再见。}
#{800}{}{Each and every position in the Imperial army serves its purpose for the entire empire. I have already seen my share of battles and after my injury, I was transferred here. Selecting new recruits is considered to be an important position. What I do here is separate wheat from chaff.}
{800}{}{帝国军队中的每一个职位都为整个帝国服务。我已经看过我的战斗经历，受伤后，我被调到了这里。选拔新兵被认为是一个重要的职位。我在这里做的是把小麦和谷壳分开。}
#{801}{}{Tell me, how did you get injured?}
{801}{}{告诉我，你是怎么受伤的？}
#{802}{}{I was wondering... }
{802}{}{我在想。。。}
#{803}{}{Fascinating, but I gotta go.}
{803}{}{很有趣，但我得走了。}
#{850}{}{It happened during the second attack of the Rebirth on the city. That was the second time they tried a large-scale assault, in numbers greatly exceeding the first attack. I was part of a regiment defending that which is now called the Dead Quarter. We were defending our position best as we could but all of a sudden, those ghouls flanked us. That was something we did not expect, as the Hunters were supposed to cover that side. We were taking heavy fire and I was hit in the left leg. Now I got this limp... for the rest of my life. In the end, we and the Hunters managed to kill off most of the ghouls that had broken through and the rest fled. Still, until this day, I cannot shake the feeling that back then, the Hunters got scared and let the ghouls get into the city without a fight.}
{850}{}{它发生在城市重生的第二次袭击中。这是他们第二次尝试大规模袭击，人数大大超过第一次袭击。我是一个团的一员，保卫现在被称为死区的地方。我们尽可能地保卫阵地，但突然，那些僵尸从我们的侧面袭击了我们。这是我们没有预料到的，因为猎人们本该掩护那一边的。我们遭到猛烈射击，我左腿中弹。现在我跛了。。。我的余生。最后，我们和猎人们成功地杀死了大部分突破的僵尸，其余的人逃跑了。不过，直到今天，我还是无法摆脱那种感觉，那时候，猎人们害怕了，让僵尸不打一架就进城了。}
#{851}{}{I was wondering... }
{851}{}{我在想。。。}
#{852}{}{Fascinating, but I gotta go.}
{852}{}{很有趣，但我得走了。}
#{900}{}{I have no intention of sharing war stories with a Hunter. I won't be telling you anything and I certainly don't want to hear any fairy tales from you.}
{900}{}{我不想和猎人分享战争故事。我不会告诉你任何事情，我当然也不想听你讲任何童话故事。}
#{901}{}{Something else, then.}
{901}{}{那就做点别的吧。}
#{902}{}{As you wish, goodbye.}
{902}{}{如你所愿，再见。}
#{950}{}{Certainly, what do you want to know?}
{950}{}{当然，你想知道什么？}
#{951}{}{Perhaps you could tell me something about Mario Carbone.}
{951}{}{也许你能告诉我一些关于马里奥・卡本的事。}
#{952}{}{Administrative division? That means you are in fact just a clerk, not a soldier, right?}
{952}{}{行政区划？也就是说你其实只是个办事员，不是军人，对吧？}
#{953}{}{I don't wanna badmouth anyone but you seem much more welcoming that most of the dwellers of the empire.}

#{954}{}{What do you know about a boy called Felix Velasquez?}
{954}{}{你对一个叫费利克斯・维拉斯克斯的男孩了解多少？}
#{955}{}{I have to ask again, are you sure you don't know anything about Felix Velasquez?}
{955}{}{我得再问一次，你确定你对费利克斯・维拉斯克斯一无所知吗？}
#{956}{}{Let's make that deal. I will sleep with you and you will tell me anything that could help me find Felix.}
{956}{}{我们做个交易吧。我会和你上床，你会告诉我任何能帮我找到费利克斯的事。}
#{957}{}{I know all about you, those children and Chuck. He told me everything.}
{957}{}{我知道你的一切，那些孩子和查克。他把一切都告诉了我。}
#{958}{}{I know all about you, those children and Chuck. Perhaps you should know that he's dead.}
{958}{}{我知道你的一切，那些孩子和查克。也许你应该知道他死了。}
#{959}{}{Actually, it's nothing. Goodbye}
{959}{}{其实，没什么。再见}
#{1000}{}{Hello. Say, we've talked before, haven't we?}
{1000}{}{你好。我们以前谈过，不是吗？}
#{1001}{}{Perhaps you could tell me something about Mario Carbone.}

{1008}{}{我知道你的一切，那些孩子和查克。也许你应该知道他死了。}
#{1009}{}{We have, but I'm leaving anyway.}
{1009}{}{我们有，但我还是要走了。}
#{1010}{}{Ugh.}
{1010}{}{啊。}
#{1050}{}{Felix Vela... Oh no. His mother sent you, didn't she? I have already told her that I haven't seen him after he left here. Is she accusing me of something? I understand she is worried, but I wouldn't expect that. I knew her husband, for crying out loud.}
{1050}{}{费利克斯・贝拉。。。哦，不。是他妈妈派你来的，不是吗？我已经告诉她在他离开这里后我没有见过他。她在指责我什么吗？我知道她很担心，但我没料到。我认识她丈夫，因为她哭得很大声。}
#{1051}{}{OK, but don't you have even the slightest idea what could've happened to him? Anything that could help?}
{1051}{}{好吧，但你一点都不知道他会怎么样吗？有什么可以帮忙的吗？}
#{1052}{}{OK, if you say so. But I wanna know something else.}
{1052}{}{好吧，如果你这么说的话。但我想知道别的。}
#{1053}{}{Fine, I won't bother you anymore.}
{1053}{}{好吧，我不再打扰你了。}
#{1100}{}{You won't let it go, will you? Look, I can't help you. Nothing I heard can be taken seriously and I highly doubt it has anything to do with Felix's disappearance.}
{1100}{}{你不会放过它的，是吗？听着，我帮不了你。我所听到的一切都不能当真，我高度怀疑这与费利克斯的失踪有关。}
#{1101}{}{So you DO know something. Go on... }
{1101}{}{所以你知道些什么。继续。。。}
#{1102}{}{OK, if you say so. But I wanna know something else.}
{1102}{}{好吧，如果你这么说的话。但我想知道别的。}
#{1103}{}{Fine, I won't bother you anymore.}
{1103}{}{好吧，我不再打扰你了。}
#{1150}{}{I wouldn't feel too good spreading rumors. It could have dire consequences, you know? I don't know you, and you're a stranger, after all. I cannot be sure you would treat that information confidentially.}
{1150}{}{我不太喜欢散布谣言。可能会有可怕的后果，你知道吗？我不认识你，你毕竟是个陌生人。我不能肯定你会对那消息保密。}
#{1151}{}{I wouldn't feel too good spreading rumors. It could have dire consequences, you know? I don't know you, and you're a stranger, after all. I cannot be sure you would treat that information confidentially.}

#{1152}{}{How can I gain your trust?}
{1152}{}{我怎样才能得到你的信任？}
#{1153}{}{OK, if you say so. But I wanna know something else.}
{1153}{}{好吧，如果你这么说的话。但我想知道别的。}
#{1154}{}{Fine, I won't bother you anymore.}
{1154}{}{好吧，我不再打扰你了。}
#{1200}{}{For that, we would have to know each other... closer. [He unexpectedly caresses your arm.] I'm a strong believer in the magic of that most intimate moment, when you give way to your passion. It can uncover the very nature of a person; you see them as they really are, not as they appear to be.}
{1200}{}{为此，我们必须互相了解。。。更接近。[他出人意料地爱抚着你的手臂]我坚信最亲密的时刻的魔力，当你让位于你的激情。它可以揭示一个人的本质；你看到的是他们真实的样子，而不是他们看起来的样子。}
#{1201}{}{Oh, so THIS is what you're after. You're not into women, then?}
{1201}{}{哦，这就是你想要的。你不喜欢女人？}
#{1202}{}{Oh, so THIS is what you're after. I almost thought you were into men, but lo and behold...}
{1202}{}{哦，这就是你想要的。我差点以为你喜欢男人，但你瞧。。。}
#{1250}{}{I prefer neither sex. I can enjoy great intimacy with both men and women. To refuse one means to deprive oneself of half the experience. It is diversity that attracts me. But with you, there is the additional benefit and unique opportunity to take it on with a stranger. You folk are different than the people of the empire, you are more animalistic, more... wild. I ask for nothing more than a couple of moments you would definitely enjoy as well.}
{1250}{}{两种性别我都不喜欢。我可以享受与男人和女人的亲密关系。拒绝一个人意味着剥夺自己一半的经验。正是多样性吸引了我。但对你来说，你还有额外的好处和独特的机会去和陌生人相处。你们这些人和帝国的人不同，你们更具动物性，更。。。野性。我只希望你也能享受几分钟。}

{1252}{}{好吧，我会和你上床的，但是你会告诉我你知道的一切。}
#{1253}{}{Can you not just pop off to the Wild Paradise for a moment?}
{1253}{}{你能不能先去一下野生天堂？}
#{1254}{}{I have no intention of screwing you, goodbye.}
{1254}{}{我不想和你上床，再见。}
#{1300}{}{Undress. [He turns around to fiddle with the computer. Judging by the sound, he just locked the doors.] Come on, I wouldn't expect someone like you to be shy. Oh no. I guess... oh yes, Beethoven will suit the moment just fine. [He fiddles with the computer again. In an instant the room is resounding with music.] I want this to be the most intense experience possible for you. Lose yourself in the music from times long gone, from times before the War. Enjoy that magnificent drama of the 5th symphony, the symphony of Fate, one of the greatest compositions of all times.}
{1300}{}{脱衣服。[他转过身来摆弄电脑。从声音上看，他只是把门锁上了。]得了吧，我可没想到你这样的人会害羞。哦不，我想。。。哦，是的，贝多芬很适合现在。[他又在摆弄电脑。在一瞬间，房间里响起了音乐]我希望这是你最强烈的体验。沉浸在久违的音乐中，沉浸在战前的音乐中。请欣赏第五交响曲《命运交响曲》中的壮丽戏剧，这是有史以来最伟大的作品之一。}
#{1301}{}{[Get undressed.]}
{1301}{}{[脱衣服]}
#{1350}{}{[Listening to the beautiful sound of Beethoven's music, colonel Browman fucks you stupid.] Very well... [He quickly gets dressed and back into his perfectly neat self.] If you want to find out more, go see Chuck in his weapon store in the Hunters' Territory. That is all I can tell you, Chuck will explain the rest. Tell him I sent you.}
{1350}{}{[听着贝多芬美妙的音乐声，布朗曼上校操你这个笨蛋。]很好。。。[他很快穿好衣服，恢复到完美整洁的状态。]如果你想知道更多，去查克在猎人领地的武器店看看。我只能告诉你了，查克会解释剩下的。告诉他是我派你来的。}
#{1351}{}{OK.}
{1351}{}{好 啊。}
#{1400}{}{In my position, it would not be a wise move to seek out sexual relations with strangers publicly, not to mention with prostitutes. It could destroy the good name of the Imperial army and that is something I can never allow to happen.}
{1400}{}{以我的立场，公开寻求与陌生人发生性关系，更不用说与妓女发生性关系，不是明智之举。这可能会毁掉帝国军队的名声，而这是我绝不允许发生的事情。}
#{1401}{}{All right, I'll sleep with you, but then you'll tell me everything you know.}
{1401}{}{好吧，我会和你上床的，但是你会告诉我你知道的一切。}

#{1450}{}{Hello again. We keep bumping into each other a lot, dont we? What can I do for you?}
{1450}{}{又来了。我们经常碰面，不是吗？有什么事吗？}
#{1451}{}{I know all about you, those children and Chuck. He told me everything.}

#{1453}{}{Nothing, bye.}
{1453}{}{没什么，再见。}
#{1454}{}{Ugh.}
{1454}{}{啊。}
#{1500}{}{Chuck talks too much. If only that were the worst about him.}
{1500}{}{查克说得太多了。如果那是他最糟糕的一面就好了。}
#{1501}{}{So you got the hots for small boys, then?}
{1501}{}{那么你喜欢小男孩了？}
#{1502}{}{I'm gonna get you for what you did to those children!}
{1502}{}{我要为你对那些孩子所做的一切惩罚你！}
#{1503}{}{What you gonna give me for not ratting you out for the sick bastard you are?}
{1503}{}{你要给我什么，因为我没有为了你这个变态的混蛋出卖你？}
#{1504}{}{What you gonna give me for not ratting you out for the sick bastard you are?}
{1504}{}{你要给我什么，因为我没有为了你这个变态的混蛋出卖你？}
#{1505}{}{It's just that I helped Chuck a little with his sweethearts. Perhaps you too need something done... something you can't ask just anyone to take care of... }

#{1507}{}{I'm outta here.}
{1507}{}{我要走了。}
#{1550}{}{And I presume you got something to do with Chuck's demise. Well it's no surprise, considering the world he was living in. I was expecting something like this to happen sooner or later. Though I have to admit that I expected him to get snuffed by a thief or something of that nature.}
{1550}{}{我猜你和查克的死有关。考虑到他生活的世界，这并不奇怪。我早就料到这样的事迟早会发生。尽管我不得不承认，我原以为他会被小偷或类似的东西掐死。}
#{1551}{}{So you got the hots for small boys, then?}
{1551}{}{那么你喜欢小男孩了？}

#{1555}{}{I'm outta here.}
{1555}{}{我要走了。}
#{1600}{}{It's understandable that someone like you would never get it. You cannot... no... you're not ABLE to indulge in life. I for one believe a man must experience everything, and I'm in a position that allows me to do just that. Why would I hesitate? One should not deprive oneself of pleasures just because society deems them "indecent". Children do not excite me any more than adults do, but to enjoy an intimate moment with a young boy once in a while, that is something special. Oh that youth and innocence of theirs... It's always so... refreshing, albeit of short duration.}
{1600}{}{像你这样的人永远得不到它是可以理解的。你不能。。。不。。。你不能沉迷于生活。就我个人而言，我相信一个人必须经历一切，而我所处的位置正是允许我这样做的。为什么我会犹豫？一个人不应该仅仅因为社会认为快乐“不雅”就剥夺自己的快乐。孩子们并不比大人更让我兴奋，但偶尔和一个小男孩享受一个亲密的时刻，那是很特别的。哦，他们的青春和纯真。。。总是那么。。。令人耳目一新，尽管持续时间很短。}
#{1601}{}{Of course their innocence doesn't last when you jump them!}
{1601}{}{当然，当你跳他们的时候，他们的清白不会持久！}
#{1602}{}{Sure, but what about Chuck?}
{1602}{}{当然，但是查克呢？}
#{1650}{}{If it wasn't me who corrupts them, someone else would step in, sooner or later. Perhaps they should consider themselves honored to have been ushered into life by someone like me. Too bad Chuck kills them afterwards.}
{1650}{}{如果不是我腐蚀了他们，迟早会有人介入的。也许他们应该认为自己很荣幸能被我这样的人带进生活。可惜查克后来杀了他们。}

#{1700}{}{I know. He's a sick fuck. But the world needs those, too. And I have to admit that I made good use of him and enjoyed the odd sexual moment with him as well. It is quite unusual for me to assume a submissive position. To be tied down, unable to do anything, to be completely at the mercy of that sadistic mastermind excited me a lot.}
{1700}{}{我知道。他是个变态。但世界也需要这些。我不得不承认，我很好地利用了他，也很享受和他发生性关系的那一刻。我采取顺从的立场是很不寻常的。被束缚，什么也做不了，完全任由那个虐待狂的主谋摆布，这让我很兴奋。}
