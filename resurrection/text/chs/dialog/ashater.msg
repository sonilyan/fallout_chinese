#{100}{}{You see a jovial looking man.}
{100}{}{你看到一个看上去很快乐的人。}
#{150}{}{You see Terrak.}
{150}{}{你看到泰拉克了。}
#{200}{}{You see a man in shining armor. He's observing what goes around him with an amused look.}
{200}{}{你看到一个穿着闪亮盔甲的人。他用一种有趣的眼神观察着周围发生的事情。}
#{250}{}{You see Shaun Terrak, an imperial army lieutenant.}
{250}{}{你看肖恩・泰瑞克，一个帝国陆军中尉。}
#{300}{}{I have nothing to say to you.}
{300}{}{我没什么好说的。}
#{400}{}{You shouldn't have done that.}
{400}{}{你不该那么做。}
#{401}{}{You shouldn't have done that.}
{401}{}{你不该那么做。}
#{500}{}{Greetings, friend. Is there something I can help you with?}
{500}{}{你好，朋友。有什么我能帮你的吗？}
#{501}{}{A pleasant day to you, miss. Is there something I can help you with?}
{501}{}{祝你愉快，小姐。有什么我能帮你的吗？}
#{502}{}{Perhaps there is. That depends on who you are.}
{502}{}{也许有。那要看你是谁了。}
#{503}{}{I doubt that. Bye.}
{503}{}{我对此表示怀疑。再见。}
#{504}{}{Ogar?!}
{504}{}{奥加？！}
#{550}{}{I'm lieutenant Shaun Terrak of the second imperial regiment. [He casually salutes you.] Currently working on a secret mission outside the City. [He grins.] The commander intended it to be punishment for sabotaging the morale of the men. But he actually did me a great service. I needed to take some rest from the empire anyway. Now, can I do something for you or not?}
{550}{}{我是帝国第二团的肖恩・特拉克中尉。[他漫不经心地向你致敬]目前正在城外执行一项秘密任务。[他咧嘴笑了笑]指挥官打算用它来惩罚那些破坏士气的人。但他确实为我做了很大的贡献。无论如何，我需要从帝国那里休息一下。我能为你做点什么吗？}
#{551}{}{Secret mission? What is it?}
{551}{}{秘密任务？这是怎么一回事？}
#{552}{}{You could tell me about the Imperial City.}
{552}{}{你可以告诉我皇城的情况。}
#{553}{}{Nothing. Goodbye.}
{553}{}{没有什么。再见。}
#{600}{}{You want me to divulge top secret information to you? Actually, why not. [He laughs.] It doesn't matter anyway. I'm supposed to track down someone called the Anonym. According to my superiors, he's hiding somewhere in Albuquerque, trying to overthrow our emperor. And that's about all I know about him. As an imperial soldier, I've got no chance of finding out anything, so I've narrowed my responsibilities down to drinking away army funds. No one from the command has complained yet.}
{600}{}{你想让我泄露绝密信息给你？实际上，为什么不呢。[他笑了]反正没关系。我应该去找一个叫匿名者的人。据我的上级说，他躲在阿尔伯克基的某个地方，试图推翻我们的皇帝。这就是我对他的全部了解。作为一名帝国士兵，我没有任何发现的机会，所以我把责任缩小到耗尽军队资金。指挥部还没有人抱怨。}
#{601}{}{That could come back to haunt you. But tell me about the empire as well.}
{601}{}{可能会再次困扰你。但也跟我说说帝国。}
#{602}{}{Any idea if there's any work to be found in the empire?}
{602}{}{你知道帝国里有没有工作吗？}
#{603}{}{Got it. I'll be on my way now.}
{603}{}{知道了。我马上就来。}
#{650}{}{I expected you to ask that. They say a lot of nonsense about the empire. We're actually people like all the rest. The only difference between us is that our ancestors came from a vault. They lived there for a long time, cramped in small space, under constant supervision and completely dependent on technology. That changed them. And when they finally emerged to the surface, old habits remained. Then they passed them to us, and they still cling to us today. Nothing unusual, really. But even the empire is slowly losing it from the drawn-out isolation. That's why I'm so glad I got away from it.}
{650}{}{我以为你会问这个。他们说了很多关于帝国的废话。我们其实和其他人一样。我们之间唯一的区别是我们的祖先来自一个地下室。他们在那里住了很长一段时间，狭小的空间里，在不断的监督下，完全依赖技术。这改变了他们。当它们最终浮出水面时，旧习惯依然存在。然后他们把它们传给我们，直到今天它们仍然依附着我们。没什么不寻常的，真的。但即使是帝国也在慢慢地从长期的孤立中失去它。这就是为什么我很高兴我摆脱了它。}
#{651}{}{I'm also interested in your secret mission. What is it?}
{651}{}{我也对你的秘密任务感兴趣。这是怎么一回事？}
#{652}{}{Any idea if there's any work to be found in the empire?}
{652}{}{你知道帝国里有没有工作吗？}
#{653}{}{I see. See you later.}
{653}{}{我懂了。再见。}
#{700}{}{[He studies you for a moment.] The imperial dwellers usually hire foreigners only rarely, but today's your lucky day. [He grins.] I've heard that Adviser Elisa is currently looking for someone capable to run a few errands for her. She might give you the job. All you need to do is tell the guards at the gate that lieutenant Terrak sent you, then you'll be able to talk to Elisa directly. You'll find her in the great hall of the imperial palace.}
{700}{}{[他研究了你一会儿]帝国居民通常很少雇用外国人，但今天是你的幸运日。[他咧嘴一笑]我听说伊莉莎顾问正在找一个能帮她跑腿的人。她可能会给你这份工作。你要做的就是告诉门口的卫兵是泰拉克中尉派你来的，然后你就可以直接和伊莉莎说话了。你会在皇宫的大殿里找到她。}
#{701}{}{Thanks. I'm also interested in your secret mission. What is it?}
{701}{}{谢谢。我也对你的秘密任务感兴趣。这是怎么一回事？}
#{702}{}{Thanks. Tell me about the empire as well.}
{702}{}{谢谢。跟我说说帝国吧。}
#{703}{}{I owe you one. See you later.}
{703}{}{我欠你一个人情。再见。}
#{750}{}{[He sighs.] The city sure is going downhill. You should leave, tribal. There's nothing for your here.}
{750}{}{[他叹了口气]这座城市肯定要走下坡路了。你应该离开，部落。这里没有你的东西。}
#{751}{}{[He sighs.] The city sure is going downhill. You should leave, tribal. There's nothing for your here.}

{802}{}{我想知道你是谁。}
#{803}{}{I'd like to know who you are.}
{803}{}{我想知道你是谁。}
#{804}{}{There's something important I have to tell you. Your superiors found out that you're ignoring their orders. They want to arrest you and make an example of you. A court-martial is already being prepared. You should get out of here as soon as possible.}
{804}{}{我有件重要的事要告诉你。你的上级发现你无视他们的命令。他们想逮捕你，以身作则。军事法庭已经准备好了。你应该尽快离开这里。}
#{805}{}{There's something important I have to tell you. Your bosses in the empire are pissed that you're not doing anything. They want to lock you up. You might want to disappear as soon as possible.}
{805}{}{我有件重要的事要告诉你。你在帝国的老板很生气你什么都没做。他们想把你关起来。你可能想尽快消失。}
#{806}{}{What was the secret mission you mentioned before?}
{806}{}{你之前提到的秘密任务是什么？}

#{808}{}{Any idea if there's any work to be found in the empire?}
{808}{}{你知道帝国里有没有工作吗？}
#{809}{}{What do you think about the new emperor?}
{809}{}{你觉得新皇帝怎么样？}
#{810}{}{A man in this establishment tried to offer me a job for the Anonym. Maybe he could help you with your search.}
{810}{}{这个机构里有个人想给我一份匿名的工作。也许他能帮你找。}
#{811}{}{You were right about the job for the empire. Elisa really did offer it to me. She also told me that it was originally your job.}
{811}{}{你对帝国工作的看法是对的。伊莉莎真的给了我。她还告诉我这本来是你的工作。}
#{812}{}{Nothing actually. Goodbye.}
{812}{}{实际上什么都没有。再见。}
#{813}{}{Uh.}
{813}{}{休斯敦大学。}
#{850}{}{[He scowls.] What the hell are you trying to pull here? You wouldn't scare even the dumbest private with that load of crap. If the army was about to court-martial me, I'd know it already.

Buy us few drinks and I'll forget about the whole nonsense. Whaddaya say?}
{850}{}{[他皱着眉头.]你到底想拉什么？你连最笨的士兵都吓不到。如果军队要对我进行军事审判，我早就知道了。毫无疑问，我在帝国里还有我的消息来源。如果你想搞笑，那就没用了。但你知道吗？我现在心情很好。请我们喝几杯，我就忘了那些废话。你说什么？}

#{951}{}{OK.}
{951}{}{好 啊。}
#{1000}{}{[Terrak starts gulping down round after round without noticing that you didn't drink much at all. But the alcohol didn't seem to have much effect on him.] Well, friend? I hope you're not done yet.}

#{1002}{}{That depends mostly on you, lieutenant. You were right - you're in no danger of being arrested yet. But how long will it last? You know the empire won't tolerate your idleness forever. You'll have to run away some day. So why not do it now?}
{1002}{}{那主要取决于你，中尉。你是对的-你还没有被逮捕的危险。但它能持续多久？你知道帝国不会永远容忍你的懒惰。总有一天你会逃跑的。那为什么现在不做呢？}
