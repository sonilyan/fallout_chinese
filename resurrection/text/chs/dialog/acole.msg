#{251}{}{You see Cole. He seems to be waiting for something, but is in no hurry at all.}
{251}{}{你看到了科尔。他似乎在等什么，但一点也不着急。}
#{300}{}{Pst. Hey, you.}
{300}{}{哈。嘿，你。}
#{301}{}{C'mere.}

#{306}{}{Don't bother me.}

{310}{}{你偶遇了科尔，一个被通缉的杀人犯。这不是一次愉快的邂逅。}
#{500}{}{Great, you really aren't from around here. I'm sure you've heard of the Mutant Hunters. What do you think of them? Don't worry, you can tell me the truth. It'll stay just between the two of us.}
{500}{}{太好了，你真的不是本地人。我相信你听说过变种猎人。你觉得他们怎么样？别担心，你可以告诉我真相。这是我们两个之间的秘密。}
#{501}{}{Great, you really aren't from around here. I'm sure you've heard of the Mutant Hunters. What do you think of them? Don't worry, you can tell me the truth. It'll stay just between the two of us.}

#{503}{}{I agree with them. The mutant scum needs to be exterminated.}
{503}{}{我同意他们的观点。变种人渣必须被消灭。}
#{504}{}{I don't really know...}

#{551}{}{Alright. They're vile murderers. Killing people because of mutation is insane.}
{551}{}{好吧。他们是卑鄙的杀人犯。因为变异而杀人是很疯狂的。}
#{552}{}{Alright. I agree with them. The mutant scum needs to be exterminated.}
{552}{}{好吧。我同意他们的观点。变种人渣必须被消灭。}
#{553}{}{I can't say, I just don't know enough about them.}
{553}{}{我不能说，我只是不够了解他们。}
#{600}{}{To hell with you. Just forget it.}
{600}{}{去你妈的。算了吧。}
#{601}{}{Bye.}
{601}{}{再见。}
#{650}{}{I'm an engineer, I work with high voltage and... hell, why am I explaining this to you? What does it matter? They're big, strong pliers with isolated handles. You'll know them when you see them.}
{650}{}{我是一名工程师，我从事高压工作…见鬼，我为什么要跟你解释这些？这有什么关系？它们是又大又结实的钳子，有单独的把手。你见到他们就知道了。}
#{651}{}{Alright, I'll help you.}
{651}{}{好吧，我来帮你。}
#{652}{}{Why don't you just go get the stuff yourself?}
{652}{}{你为什么不自己去拿呢？}
#{653}{}{What do I get from helping you?}
{653}{}{我帮你能得到什么？}
#{654}{}{Can I go give the information to the Hunters myself?}

{655}{}{我不会帮你的。我不会为你冒这个险的。}
#{700}{}{Awesome, glad to meet someone who shares my views. You may call me Cole. My surname doesn't matter. I'm in a bit of a trouble right now, maybe you could lend a hand.}
{700}{}{太好了，很高兴见到和我观点相同的人。你可以叫我科尔。我姓什么不重要。我现在有一点麻烦，也许你可以帮帮我。}

#{702}{}{With what?}
{702}{}{用什么？}
#{750}{}{My body has been showing slight signs of mutation, nothing serious, but even that was enough to make the imperial army come after me. They want to hand me over to the Hunters to keep the deal they have with them about the defense of the city.}
{750}{}{我的身体已经出现了轻微的变异迹象，并不严重，但即使这样也足以让帝国军队来追杀我。他们想把我交给猎人来履行和他们签订的保卫城市的协议。}
#{751}{}{How can I help you?}
{751}{}{我该怎么帮你 ？}
#{752}{}{Oh. I'd rather not have anything to do with that.}
{752}{}{哦。我可不想跟这事扯上关系。}
#{800}{}{I need to get out of the Imperial City, but the soldiers have my description and check anyone who leaves. Go to my apartment and bring me my pistol and pliers.

{800}{}{我要离开帝国之城，但士兵们有我的描述他们会检查所有离开的人。去我的公寓把我的手枪和钳子带来。有我的塔式钳子，也许能用它们穿过栅栏。如果潜行不行，我就想办法逃出去。该死，我至少要有机会为自己辩护。}
#{801}{}{Where's your apartment?}
{801}{}{你的公寓在哪里？}
#{802}{}{I'd rather not do this.}

{853}{}{我能得到什么好处？}
#{854}{}{Couldn't I just go give the information to the Hunters myself?}

#{855}{}{I won't help you. I'm not going to take that risk for you.}
{855}{}{我不会帮你的。我不会为你冒这个险的。}
#{900}{}{Because they're probably guarding my apartment! You might be able to slip by unnoticed, or at least talk your way out if they catch you. They'd shoot me on sight.}
{900}{}{因为他们可能在看守我的公寓！你也许可以在不被注意的情况下溜过去，或者至少在他们抓你的时候，你可以通过说话逃出去。他们一看到我就会开枪。}

{1000}{}{太好了。我在这儿等你。请尽快回来。我在这里待得越久，他们就越有可能找到我。}
#{1001}{}{OK.}

{1052}{}{用什么？}
#{1100}{}{There's a lot of mutants hiding in the Imperial City. I've been trying to find out their identities for the Hunters so we could get rid of them. But the imperial army got a whiff of it and now they're after me. They're knowingly protecting the mutants. They'll never let me leave the City alive.}
{1100}{}{有很多的变种人隐藏在帝国之城里。我一直在为猎人寻找他们的身份，这样我们就能除掉他们。但帝国军队嗅到了风声，所以现在他们来找我了，他们故意保护变种人。他们不会让我活着离开这座城市的。}

#{1250}{}{Well? Do you have my things?}
{1250}{}{怎么样？你拿到我的东西了吗？}
#{1251}{}{One private is guarding your apartment. And by the way, he said you're nothing but a common killer.}
{1251}{}{有个二等兵守着你的公寓。顺便说一句，他说你只是个普通杀手。}
#{1252}{}{Not yet, hold on a while longer.}
{1252}{}{还没有，再等一会儿。}
#{1253}{}{Naaah.}
{1253}{}{不。}
#{1300}{}{Well, obviously he'd tell you something stupid like that. They don't want the truth getting out, so they made me into a killer.}
{1300}{}{好吧，显然他会跟你说这种愚蠢的话。他们不想让真相泄露出去，所以把我变成了杀手。}
#{1301}{}{I believe you.}
{1301}{}{我相信你。}
#{1302}{}{I don't believe you. I think you're lying and you really are a killer!}
{1302}{}{我不相信你。我觉得你在撒谎，你真的是个杀手！}
#{1350}{}{Easy there. OK, it's true. I killed some guy, I don't even know who it was. Shit, I was so drunk, I didn't know what I was doing! Look, if you help me outta here, I'll pay you 500 caps.}
{1350}{}{别紧张。好吧，这是真的。我杀了一个人，我都不知道是谁。妈的，我喝多了，都不知道自己在做什么！听着，如果你帮我出去，我付你500瓶盖。}

{1450}{}{不要想太久。我命悬一线。}
#{1451}{}{OK.}
{1451}{}{OK。}
#{1500}{}{We can take advantage of that. As an imperial soldier I could leave the City without any problems. They're looking for a dweller, not a soldier. Bring me the that moron's pistol and, most importantly, his armor. You'll have to get rid of him somehow. I don't care if you kill him, but don't damage the armor and try not to get the whole imperial army on your ass.}
{1500}{}{我们可以利用这一点。作为一名帝国士兵，我可以毫无困难地离开这座城市。他们要找的是居民，不是士兵。把那个白痴的手枪给我，还有最重要的，他的盔甲。你得想办法摆脱他。我不管你杀不杀他，但别弄坏盔甲，别让整个帝国军队追上你。}
#{1502}{}{Does the stuff have to be directly from the private? Can't I get it another way?}
{1502}{}{这些东西必须是私人的吗？我就不能换个方法吗？}
#{1501}{}{I'm on it.}
{1501}{}{我这就去。}
#{1550}{}{Goddammit, will you help me then?!}

#{1552}{}{I'm still thinking about it.}
{1552}{}{我还在考虑。}
#{1553}{}{Nooooo.}
{1553}{}{不不。}
#{1600}{}{Thanks, at least someone does. I got an idea. As an imperial soldier I could leave the City without any problems. They're looking for a dweller, not a soldier.

You might have to kill him, should it come to that, but don't damage the armor and try not the get the whole imperial army on your ass.}
{1600}{}{谢谢，至少有人知道。我有个主意。作为一名帝国士兵，我可以毫无困难地离开这座城市。他们要找的是居民，不是士兵。把那个士兵的手枪给我，最重要的是，他的盔甲。你得想办法摆脱他。如果真到那一步，你可能得杀了他，但别弄坏他的盔甲，也别让整个帝国军队追上你。}

#{1653}{}{Here you go. He gave it to me willingly when I told him I might be able to catch you with that.}
{1653}{}{给你。当我告诉他我可以用它抓到你时，他很乐意给我的。}
#{1654}{}{Here you go. All I did was pull out a gun and his knees started shaking. He's currently enjoying the longest period of unconsciousness in his life.}
{1654}{}{给你。我只是掏出枪，他的膝盖就开始颤抖。他目前处于一生中最长的昏迷期。}
#{1655}{}{Here you go. All I did was pull out a gun and his knees started shaking. He's dead now.}

#{1657}{}{Naaah.}

{2401}{}{呃。}

{2451}{}{奇怪的巧合。我两样都有。拿着盔甲和手枪。}
#{2452}{}{OK. I'm on it.}
{2452}{}{OK。我这就去。}
#{2500}{}{No idea where you got that, but great. Now I can get out of here. Thanks for the help.}
{2500}{}{不知道你从哪弄来的，不过很好。现在我可以离开这里了。谢谢你的帮助。}
#{2501}{}{No idea where you got that, but great. Now I can get out of here. Thanks for the help.}
{2501}{}{不知道你从哪弄来的，不过很好。现在我可以离开这里了。谢谢你的帮助。}
#{2502}{}{And the caps you promised?}
{2502}{}{你答应的瓶盖呢？}
#{2503}{}{Alright. Farewell.}
{2503}{}{好的。再见。}
#{2550}{}{And where the hell would I get those? I don't have any! Calm down, I will keep my word. I can get them. We'll meet in the Suburbs near the caravans, I'll pay you there.}
{2550}{}{我去哪弄这些东西？我没有！冷静点，我会守信用的。我能得到他们。我们在郊区的商队附近碰面，我在那儿付钱给你。}
#{2551}{}{OK, but I'm warning you. Don't try to screw me over.}
{2551}{}{好吧，但我警告你。别想骗我。}
#{2600}{}{I knew you'd show up. Wouldn't miss your payment for the world, would you? I had to sell the armor to get the caps, but I keep my word. Here are the caps I promised you.}
{2600}{}{我就知道你会来。你不会错过你的报酬吧？我不得不卖掉盔甲才能拿到瓶盖，但我信守诺言。这是我答应过你的瓶盖。}
#{2601}{}{Awesome. What are you doing here, anyway?}
{2601}{}{太棒了。你在这里做什么？}
#{2602}{}{Cool. Now we're even.}
{2602}{}{酷。现在我们扯平了。}
#{2603}{}{Cool. Now we're even.}
{2603}{}{酷。现在我们扯平了。}
#{2604}{}{Cooool...}
{2604}{}{酷...}
