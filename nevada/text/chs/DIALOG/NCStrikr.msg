#{100}{}{You see Stryker.}
{100}{}{你看到史崔克了。}
#{101}{}{You see a powerfully-built black man. He looks like someone you don't want to mess with.}
{101}{}{你看到一个体格健壮的黑人。他看起来像个你不想惹的人。}
#{110}{}{[This man looks like he never stops frowning. He studies you through narrowed eyes.] I'm Stryker. What are you doing here?}
{110}{}{[这个人看起来总是眉头紧锁。他眯着眼睛研究你]我是史崔克。你在这里干什么？}
#{111}{}{I was just passing by when I saw the place. I thought we might be able to help each other.}
{111}{}{我刚路过就看到了那个地方。我想我们可以互相帮助。}
#{112}{}{I want one thing: to work for you.}
{112}{}{我想要一件事：为你工作。}
#{113}{}{I just love to learn, you know? I want to know more about you.}
{113}{}{我只是喜欢学习，你知道吗？我想多了解你。}
#{114}{}{I'm a busy man. If you don't have anything for me, stop wasting my time.}
{114}{}{我是个大忙人。如果你没有东西给我，别再浪费我的时间了。}
#{115}{}{[He turns his head to listen to a henchman who whispers something in his ear, then looks back at you] Get the fuck out of here. Tell your boss his next spy goes home in a bag.}
{115}{}{[他转过头去听一个心腹在他耳边窃窃私语，然后回头看你]滚开。告诉你老板他的下一个间谍会带着包回家。}
#{116}{}{Ah, yes... My boss... }
{116}{}{啊，是的...我的老板...}
#{117}{}{Yeah? Maybe. But... }
{117}{}{是 啊？也许 吧。但是...}
#{118}{}{But?}
{118}{}{但是呢？}
#{119}{}{Right to the point. Good. But how do I know you mean it?}
{119}{}{直截了当。很好。但我怎么知道你是认真的？}
#{120}{}{I want to work for you. I'm serious.}
{120}{}{我想为你工作。我是认真的。}
#{121}{}{I need good people, especially from out of town. But how do I know you're good? You got anyone that can vouch for you?}
{121}{}{我需要好人，尤其是外地来的。但我怎么知道你很好？有人能为你担保吗？}
#{122}{}{I can tell it's not a good idea to waste your time, so I'll just go.}
{122}{}{我知道浪费你的时间不是个好主意，所以我就走。}
#{123}{}{Well... No.}
{123}{}{好...不。}
#{124}{}{That runt from the ring said you could find a place for me.}
{124}{}{拳击场的那个矮子说你能给我找个地方。}
#{125}{}{Yeah - Big Louie himself. Remember where you came from.}
{125}{}{是的-大路易自己。记得你从哪里来的吗。}
#{126}{}{I already helped you with the Devero situation. Just ask your goons.}
{126}{}{我已经帮你解决了德维罗的问题。问问你的手下。}
#{127}{}{I saved one of your people from Bertolini.}
{127}{}{我从贝托里尼那里救了你的一个人。}
#{128}{}{I have nothing to prove to you. My actions speak for themselves.}
{128}{}{我没有什么要向你证明的。我的行为说明了一切。}
#{129}{}{Give me a chance! I'm sick of playing the small game - I want to move on to the big leagues!}
{129}{}{给我一个机会！我厌倦了玩小游戏-我想去大联盟！}
#{130}{}{Yeah... You've got potential. And more importantly, Thompson doesn't know you. That's good.}
{130}{}{是 啊...你有潜力。更重要的是，汤普森不认识你。那很好。}
#{131}{}{I'm ready for serious work, just as long as there's serious pay at the end of it.}
{131}{}{我已经做好了认真工作的准备，只要最后有认真的报酬就行。}
#{132}{}{I'll do everything I can.}
{132}{}{我会尽我所能。}
#{133}{}{I'm putting you on a practice run first. Don't fuck it up, and you'll get paid when the job's done.}
{133}{}{我先让你练习跑步。别搞砸了，工作完成后你会得到报酬的。}
#{134}{}{Of course. What is it?}
{134}{}{当然。这是怎么一回事？}
#{135}{}{There's a guy named Patrick, making a lot of friends in the slums. Whatever he's planning, I don't need it. Deal with him.}
{135}{}{有个叫帕特里克的家伙，在贫民窟交了很多朋友。不管他在计划什么，我都不需要。对付他。}
#{136}{}{You mean you want me to kill him?}
{136}{}{你是说你想让我杀了他？}
#{137}{}{Consider it done.}
{137}{}{考虑一下吧。}
#{138}{}{What, are you afraid to get your hands dirty? I don't need pussies here! You got a problem, you can walk out that fucking door!}
{138}{}{什么，你害怕弄脏你的手吗？我不需要娘娘腔！你有问题，你可以走出那该死的门！}
#{139}{}{Okay, okay, I get it. I'm going.}
{139}{}{好吧，好吧，我明白了。我要走了。}
#{140}{}{I'll do the job. I just wanted to make sure.}
{140}{}{我来做这个工作。我只是想确认一下。}
#{141}{}{I think it's better to keep him alive.}
{141}{}{我觉得还是让他活着好。}
#{142}{}{Yeah? Why?}
{142}{}{是 啊？为什么？}
#{143}{}{You're making a mistake... }
{143}{}{你犯了个错误...}
#{144}{}{Patrick spreads the word of God. He's convincing people to be peaceful. Isn't that helpful to you? Kill him, and the people in the slums won't just become angry, they'll become violent.}
{144}{}{帕特里克传播上帝的话语。他在说服人们保持和平。这对你没帮助吗？杀了他，贫民窟里的人不仅会生气，还会变得暴力。}
#{145}{}{Actually, never mind. You'd know best.}
{145}{}{其实，没关系。你最好知道。}
#{146}{}{A mistake? A MISTAKE?! Who the fuck are you?! I'm the boss here - when I tell you to do something, you get it fucking DONE! Now get the fuck out! Next time I see you, you'd better have that preachers fucking HEART in your hand!}
{146}{}{一个错误？一个错误？！你他妈的是谁？！我是这里的老板-当我叫你做什么的时候，你他妈的就完成了！给我滚出去！下次我再见到你的时候，你最好拿着那颗传教士的心！}
#{147}{}{Hmm... That makes sense. Okay, the job's off. Of course, that means no pay.}
{147}{}{Hmm...这是有道理的。好吧，工作结束了。当然，那意味着没有报酬。}
#{148}{}{It can't be helped.}
{148}{}{没办法。}
#{149}{}{}
{149}{}{}
#{150}{}{About that job... }
{150}{}{关于那份工作...}
#{151}{}{What about it?}
{151}{}{那怎么办？}
#{152}{}{It's totally taken care of. Nothing to worry about at all.}
{152}{}{完全搞定了。没什么好担心的。}
#{153}{}{I think it would be better to leave Patrick alive.}
{153}{}{我想最好让帕特里克活着。}
#{154}{}{That Mormon missionary is out of the picture.}
{154}{}{那个摩门教传教士出局了。}
#{155}{}{Good. Now I know you're serious about me... Or my money. Either one's good if you get the job done. Here's your pay.}
{155}{}{很好。现在我知道你对我很认真...或者我的钱。如果你完成了任务，任何一个都是好的。这是你的薪水。}
#{156}{}{Thanks.}
{156}{}{谢谢。}
#{160}{}{I need a courier whose face isn't associated with me. That means you. Here's 1000 bucks - that's for the job, not you. You steal from me, and it won't matter where you run, we'll find you.}
{160}{}{我需要一个与我无关的信使。那意味着你。这是1000美元-那是给工作的，不是给你的。你偷了我的东西，不管你跑哪儿，我们都会找到你的。}
#{161}{}{What's the money for?}
{161}{}{这些钱是用来干什么的？}
#{162}{}{There's a guy near the nightclub holding some chemicals for me. I want a long relationship with him, so I want this to go smooth. And I don't want anyone to know I'm stocking up on chemicals, so don't let on this is for me. Got it?}
{162}{}{夜总会附近有个人给我拿了一些化学药品。我想和他保持长久的关系，所以我希望一切顺利。我不想让任何人知道我在囤积化学品，所以别让人知道这是给我的。知道了？}
#{163}{}{Got it. I'll go pick up the shipment.}
{163}{}{知道了。我去提货。}
#{164}{}{Okay, enough bullshit. Time for somre real work. [he places a camera on the table] I want pictures of Thompson's headquarters under the old city hall. Get every corridor and inner door. Thompson doesn't know you, so you should be able to get in, but don't let them see you taking pictures.}
{164}{}{好了，废话少说。是时候好好工作了。[他把相机放在桌子上]我想要老市政厅下面汤普森总部的照片。把所有走廊和内门都找出来。汤普森不认识你，所以你应该可以进去，但不要让他们看到你拍照。}
#{165}{}{No problem.}
{165}{}{没问题。}
#{166}{}{I've got the chemicals.}
{166}{}{我有化学药品。}
#{167}{}{[He checks the package's contents, then hands it to a henchman] Take this to the lab. I want results tomorrow. [he turns to you] Basic job. You get 100 bucks.}
{167}{}{[他检查了包裹里的东西，然后把它交给一个手下]把这个拿到实验室。我明天要结果。[他转向你]基本的工作。你得到100美元。}
#{168}{}{I understand. No problem.}
{168}{}{我理解。没问题。}
#{169}{}{Not much, but it's something.}
{169}{}{不多，但很重要。}
#{170}{}{What do I need to photograph, again?}
{170}{}{我还需要拍什么？}
#{171}{}{I've finished the job. Here's the camera and the photos.}
{171}{}{我已经完成了工作。这是相机和照片。}
#{172}{}{[He glowers at you] Listen this time. I want pictures of the corridors in Thompson's headquarters so we can understand its layout. Small rooms like bathrooms don't matter to me, but I want all the hallways and corridors. And for fuck's sake, don't let anyone see you doing it!}
{172}{}{[他怒视着你]这次听我说。我想要汤普森总部走廊的照片，这样我们就可以了解它的布局。像浴室这样的小房间对我来说并不重要，但我想要所有的走廊和走廊。看在他妈的份上，别让任何人看到你这么做！}
#{173}{}{Good. [he peers at the photos] Hnnh... Looks defensible... Gonna be tough... }
{173}{}{很好。[他看着照片]嗯...看起来很合理...会很艰难...}
#{174}{}{What's going to be tough?}
{174}{}{有什么困难？}
#{175}{}{Ahem. My payment?}
{175}{}{啊哼。我的报酬？}
#{176}{}{[He glances at you] Not now. Anyway, here's your money. [without looking, he reaches into a drawer and hands you a wad of bills]}
{176}{}{[他看了你一眼]现在不行。不管怎样，这是你的钱。[没有看，他把手伸进抽屉递给你一沓钞票]}
#{177}{}{Alright. Got any more jobs?}
{177}{}{好吧。还有工作吗？}
#{178}{}{[He points a finger at you without looking up from the photos] Don't interrupt me again. Last warning. [he reaches into a drawer and hands you a wad of bills] Here's your money.}
{178}{}{[他用手指着你，没有抬头看照片]别再打断我。最后一次警告。[他把手伸进抽屉递给你一沓钞票]这是你的钱。}
#{179}{}{Got any more jobs?}
{179}{}{还有工作吗？}
#{180}{}{Yeah, I got something in... [suddenly, a henchman leans over and whispers something in his ear] ...You're sure? Hmm... Didn't see that coming. [he turns to you] No, nothing. You can go.}
{180}{}{是的，我有东西在里面...[突然，一个心腹俯身在耳边低语]…你确定？Hmm...没想到会这样。[他转向你]不，没什么。你可以走了。}
#{181}{}{Uh, okay... }
{181}{}{呃，好吧...}
#{182}{}{Yeah, I got something in mind for you. [he crosses his arms and gives you a very serious look] So you've probably figured out I'm trying to get rid of Thompson, yeah? He thinks this city needs a dictator to straighten it out, but he's wrong. You can't just *make* a businessman give you the shirt off his back. A brahmin won't make any milk if you don't feed it, get it? [he leans forward slightly] You undertand, right? This isn't just about money or power. What we're doing here... It's about the city. The future of everyone in Reno depends on us. I want you to know this.}
{182}{}{是的，我有点事要告诉你。[他交叉双臂，严肃地看了你一眼]那么你可能已经知道我在试图摆脱汤普森，是吗？他认为这个城市需要一个独裁者来整顿，但他错了。你不能让一个商人把他的衬衫给你。一个双头牛如果你不喂它就不会出奶，明白吗？[他微微向前倾]你理解了，对吗？这不仅仅是金钱或权力的问题。我们在这里做什么...是关于城市的。雷诺每个人的未来都取决于我们。我想让你知道这个。}
#{183}{}{I understand. What do you need me to do?}
{183}{}{我理解。你需要我做什么？}
#{184}{}{[He pulls out a little box and carefully places it on the table] We did some good things with those chemicals you delivered. This contains one of them. Here are poisoned contraceptives. You need to slip it to Betty Paige and her whores. Understand?}
{184}{}{[他拿出一个小盒子，小心地放在桌子上]我们用你送来的那些化学品做了一些好事。其中包含一个。这是有毒的避孕药。你得把它交给贝蒂・佩奇和她的妓女。明白吗？}
#{185}{}{Yes... Actually, no. What do a bunch of prostitutes have to do with your plans?}
{185}{}{对...事实上，没有。一群妓女和你的计划有什么关系？}
#{186}{}{I don't care who you want killed, if the money's good enough.}
{186}{}{我不管你想杀谁，如果钱够的话。}
#{187}{}{I don't wan't to know the details. Let it be on someone else's conscience. I'll do the job and take my money when it's done.}
{187}{}{我不想知道细节。让它落在别人的良心上吧。我会做好这项工作，做完后把钱拿走。}
#{188}{}{No... I can't. I can't simply murder a woman like this.}
{188}{}{不...我不能。我不能简单地谋杀这样的女人。}
#{189}{}{It's time to take the fight to Thompson. Betty Paige is his madam, his lover... His Achilles' heel. Her death will put him off-balance and give me the edge I need. History shows how women can be the downfall of great men. That's why I'm a bachelor.}
{189}{}{是时候向汤普森宣战了。贝蒂佩吉是他的夫人，他的情人...他的致命伤。她的死会让他失去平衡，给我需要的优势。历史告诉我们，女人是如何被伟大的男人打败的。所以我才是单身汉。}
#{190}{}{[He studies you silently for a while, then nods] I understand. You can leave... But never come back.}
{190}{}{[他默默地研究了你一会儿，然后点头]我明白。你可以离开...但再也不回来了。}
#{191}{}{[Leave.]}
{191}{}{[离开]}
#{192}{}{[Nods] You've got your orders. You'll be paid after Paige's... Tragic accident. And that better be how it looks, by the way - I don't want this getting traced back to me.}
{192}{}{[点头]你已经接到命令了。你会在Paige的...悲惨的事故。最好是这样，顺便说一句-我不想让这一切追溯到我身上。}
#{193}{}{Got it.}
{193}{}{知道了。}
#{194}{}{There's clearly more to this story. What's this about, really?}
{194}{}{很明显，这个故事还有很多。这是怎么回事，真的？}
#{195}{}{...I can tell you what this is all about, but it's a long story. You don't need to hear it if you're just in it for the money.}
{195}{}{……我可以告诉你这是怎么回事，但说来话长。如果你只是为了钱，你不需要听。}
#{196}{}{Give me the details.}
{196}{}{告诉我细节。}
#{197}{}{Actually, I don't have time. See you.}
{197}{}{实际上，我没有时间。再见。}
#{198}{}{Thompson and I were in the same gang. About five years ago, one of the Reno locals asked our boss, Big Louie, to help him in the civil war. Boss stepped in and then decided he'd rather rule the city himself. Once he had everything he wanted though, something changed in him.}
{198}{}{汤普森和我是一伙的。大约五年前，里诺的一个当地人请我们的老板大路易在内战中帮助他。老板插手进来，然后决定他宁愿自己统治这个城市。一旦他拥有了他想要的一切，他内心的某些东西就改变了。}
#{199}{}{What changed?}
{199}{}{什么改变了？}
#{200}{}{Louie, he was from Reno himself. He wanted to bring back the "Golden Age" when everyone had enough, but he realized he couldn't do it. Reno's just not the same place it was back then. Big Louie couldn't take it and fucked off to the wasteland, leaving Thompson and me in charge. Thompson was supposed to hold the mayor's office and I was in charge of the local defense. We were supposed to be partners, but it didn't work out.}
{200}{}{路易，他是雷诺人。他想在大家都吃饱了的时候把“黄金时代”带回来，但他意识到自己做不到。里诺和那时候不一样了。大路易受不了了，就滚到荒地去了，让汤普森和我负责。汤普森本该担任市长的职务，而我负责当地的防务。我们本来是搭档的，但没成功。}
#{201}{}{Why?}
{201}{}{为什么？}
#{202}{}{Because running a city ain't like the gang shit we were doing before, you get it? You can't keep this many people in line with just violence. You need to *lead* them. You need an *idea* that makes them *want* you in charge. And Thompson and I have different ideas. Thompson just wants to enslave everyone, like just after the Great War, when the mayor forced people to work and crushed any resistance. But those were different times. It won't work now.}
{202}{}{因为管理一个城市不像我们以前做的那样，明白吗？你不能让这么多人和暴力保持一致。你需要领导他们。你需要一个让他们想让你负责的想法。汤普森和我有不同的想法。汤普森只是想奴役所有人，就像二战后，市长强迫人们工作，镇压任何抵抗。但那是不同的时代。现在不行了。}
#{203}{}{So what's your idea?}
{203}{}{你有什么想法？}
#{204}{}{Once Thompson's out of the way, I'll lead a militia strong enough to keep order. Then I'll organize the business leaders into a guild that make decisions for the town as a group. The militia will protect the guild and get a percentage of their profits in return. [he snaps his fingers] Simple as that.}
{204}{}{一旦汤普森出事，我将率领一支足够强大的民兵维持秩序。然后我会把商业领袖组织成一个公会，作为一个团体为小镇做决定。民兵会保护公会，并从中获得一定比例的利润作为回报。就这么简单。}
#{205}{}{Do you really think the business leaders will be willing to share power?}
{205}{}{你真的认为商界领袖会愿意分享权力吗？}
#{206}{}{Yeah, yeah, they'll bitch and moan, but the truth is they've been fighting forever and it's only caused them trouble. How long can this go on? They'll come around, especially when they figure out what'll happen if they're the only ones *without* the militia's help.}
{206}{}{是的，是的，他们会抱怨和呻吟，但事实是他们一直在战斗，这只会给他们带来麻烦。这能持续多久？他们会回来的，尤其是当他们知道如果他们是唯一没有民兵帮助的人会发生什么的时候。}
#{207}{}{Don't you want to be something greater than just the head of the militia?}
{207}{}{难道你不想成为比民兵首领更伟大的人物吗？}
#{208}{}{What else can I do, now that I'm neck-deep in this city's shit?! I told you, the old gang tactics won't work here. This isn't the wasteland, it's a city. The people here are smart and organized. But there's a good side to that - this city could do great things once I straighten it out. Once that happens... Being head of the militia will be enough for any man.}
{208}{}{我还可以做什么，现在我在这个城市的狗屎脖子深？！我告诉过你，旧的帮派战术在这里行不通。这不是荒地，这是一座城市。这里的人既聪明又有条理。但这也有好的一面――一旦我把它理顺，这个城市可以做大事。一旦发生了...当民兵队长对任何人都足够了。}
#{209}{}{Now I get it. Well, gotta go mind my own business. Thanks for explaining.}
{209}{}{现在我明白了。好吧，管好我自己的事。谢谢你的解释。}
#{210}{}{Betty Paige is dead.}
{210}{}{贝蒂・佩吉死了。}
#{211}{}{[He gives you a cunning look, then pulls out 100 dollars] That's all. Not enough? Then I'm sure you can find another job, since you've been working so many angles in this town. At this point, I need people who are fighting for more than just money. Take your payment and go - I don't need you anymore.}
{211}{}{[他狡猾地看了你一眼，然后掏出100美元]仅此而已。还不够？那么我相信你能找到另一份工作，因为你在这个镇上工作了这么多角度。在这一点上，我需要的不仅仅是为了钱而战斗的人。拿着你的钱走吧-我不再需要你了。}
#{212}{}{[Leave.]}
{212}{}{[离开]}
#{213}{}{It was an easy job, so there's not much pay. But if we pull this next job off, we're golden.}
{213}{}{这是一份容易的工作，所以薪水不多。但如果我们能完成下一个任务，我们就是黄金。}
#{214}{}{Thanks for the cash, but what are you up to?}
{214}{}{谢谢你的现金，你在忙什么？}
#{215}{}{Finally! So, what do I have to do to get rich?}
{215}{}{终于！那么，我要怎么做才能发财呢？}
#{216}{}{It's time to go for Thompson's throat. We've got to take the town hall, and you're gonna help us.}
{216}{}{是时候抓住汤普森的喉咙了。我们得去市政厅，你来帮我们。}
#{217}{}{Wait, you want me to attack Thompson's headquarters? I'm not much of a fighter, you know... }
{217}{}{等等，你想让我袭击汤普森的总部？我不是什么斗士，你知道...}
#{218}{}{Wait, you want me to attack Thompson's headquarters? This is going to be awesome!}
{218}{}{等等，你想让我袭击汤普森的总部？这会很棒的！}
#{219}{}{Your photos show he's got video feeds in his bunker, and I know he's got reinforcements on radio. You're gonna take out the power in his bunker so we can catch him by surprise. Once you've done that, give the signal to my men. They'll be waiting near the town hall.}
{219}{}{你的照片显示他在地堡里有录像，我知道他在广播里有增援。你要切断他地堡里的电源，这样我们就能出其不意地抓住他。一旦你这么做了，给我的人信号。他们将在市政厅附近等候。}
#{220}{}{Hmm... I wonder what Big Louie would say if he knew what you were doing?}
{220}{}{Hmm...我想知道如果大路易知道你在做什么，他会怎么说？}
#{221}{}{[His eyes narrow] Watch yourself. He already knows... Not that I care. I don't live to do his bitch work.}
{221}{}{[他眯着眼睛]小心点。他已经知道了...我不在乎。我活不下去做他那该死的工作。}
#{222}{}{Isn't he your boss?}
{222}{}{他不是你老板吗？}
#{223}{}{He's useful right now, so I keep him happy with a Christmas present here and there. But I'm more than able to do business without him.}
{223}{}{他现在很有用，所以我到处送他圣诞礼物让他开心。但是没有他我也能做生意。}
#{224}{}{Christmas presents? Seriously?}
{224}{}{圣诞礼物？说真的？}
#{225}{}{What are your plans for this war?}
{225}{}{你对这场战争有什么计划？}
#{226}{}{Thompson and you are from the same gang, right?}
{226}{}{汤普森和你是一伙的，对吧？}
#{227}{}{Why can't you work together with Thompson? Together, you could control the whole city.}
{227}{}{你为什么不能和汤普森一起工作？你们可以一起控制整个城市。}
#{228}{}{Forget it, I don't want to dig into your life.}
{228}{}{算了吧，我不想深究你的生活。}
#{229}{}{Yeah, seriously! You delivered the last one, didn't you? Big Louie needs chems, guns and ammo for his gang. He's practically begging. I need them too, but I can spare enough to maintain our relationship.}
{229}{}{是啊，说真的！你送了最后一个，是吗？大路易需要化学药品，枪支和弹药。他简直是在乞讨。我也需要他们，但我可以拿出足够的钱来维持我们的关系。}
#{230}{}{No one really knew what was coming when Big Louie took Reno. I didn't think it would be this goddamn *complicated*. You can't control Reno because *no one* controls Reno - the whole city's a bunch of small parts, every one with their own people and rules. We didn't have enough men to manage it all, especially since people were demanding changes from day one. It was chaos. Fuck, it still is!}
{230}{}{没人知道大路易带走雷诺的时候会发生什么。我没想到会这么复杂。你不能控制雷诺，因为没有人控制雷诺――整个城市都是一堆小地方，每个地方都有自己的人和规则。我们没有足够的人手来管理这一切，尤其是因为人们从第一天起就要求改变。一片混乱。妈的，还是这样！}
#{231}{}{[Leave.]}
{231}{}{[离开]}
#{232}{}{The only choice is to set up a central authority and get everyone to fall in line. But the business leaders wouldn't want that, and they're the ones we need on our side. So, I'll have to make friends, make deals... Make it worth their while. They'll come around eventually. As soon as I get one in, they'll see the benefits and the others will follow.}
{232}{}{唯一的选择是建立一个中央权力机构，让每个人都服从。但商界领袖不希望这样，他们正是我们需要的人。所以，我要交朋友，做交易...让他们觉得值得。他们终究会回来的。我一进去，他们就会看到好处，其他人也会跟着进来。}
#{233}{}{The boss left each of us in charge of different parts of the city. But Thompson's a dreamer - he wants absolute power over everything in Reno. That includes me, and I don't like that idea. But even if he wanted to share power... We just couldn't. We're too goddamn different.}
{233}{}{老板让我们每个人负责城市的不同部分。但汤普森是一个梦想家-他想要在雷诺的一切绝对权力。包括我在内，我不喜欢这个主意。但即使他想分享权力...我们就是做不到。我们太不一样了。}
#{234}{}{I live in the real world, he doesn't. He basically wants to be Reno's dictator. You wouldn't think that's a good way to make friends, but he's got a lot of support. It took me a while to figure out why - the common people here have *never* been free. Everyone's a slave, even if they don't call them that - to their employers, or their pimps, or their landlords, or their drug dealers. They don't know any other way to live, and Thompson uses that. But you know, the common people don't really matter. It's the business leaders you need on your side, and they don't want a dictator, which means it's *never* going to happen. We can't just wipe out our opponents in one night and put our own people in place - not in a city this size, with this many leaders. That gang war shit doesn't cut it on this scale. I've spent the last five years learning that.}
{234}{}{我生活在现实世界里，他没有。他基本上想成为雷诺的独裁者。你不会认为那是交朋友的好方法，但他得到了很多支持。我花了一段时间才弄明白为什么这里的老百姓从来没有自由过。每个人都是奴隶，即使他们不这么称呼他们――对他们的雇主，皮条客，房东，毒贩。他们不知道其他的生活方式，汤普森就是这样。但是你知道，普通人并不重要。你需要的是商界领袖，他们不想要独裁者，这意味着这是永远不会发生的。我们不能在一个晚上就消灭我们的对手，把我们自己的人安置到位――不能在这么大的城市，有这么多领导人。帮派战争这玩意可没这么厉害。我花了五年的时间学习这个。}
#{240}{}{Once you're done your part, you can go. I don't need you to fight. I won't say no if you want to help, though. In the meantime, I'll get my people ready.}
{240}{}{一旦你完成了你的任务，你就可以走了。我不需要你打架。不过，如果你想帮忙，我不会拒绝的。同时，我会让我的人做好准备。}
#{241}{}{We've taken the town hall. Thompson is dead.}
{241}{}{我们占领了市政厅。汤普森死了。}
#{242}{}{Finally! [he sighs in relief] Reno's going to remember this day. It's the first day of the future! Makes me want to crack open a bottle of whiskey... But you deserve a lot more than that.}
{242}{}{终于！雷诺会记住这一天的。这是未来的第一天！让我想打开一瓶威士忌...但你应该得到更多。}
#{243}{}{[Next.]}
{243}{}{[下一步。]}
#{244}{}{[He counts out your payment] You know, I don't think anyone else in this place could have done what you did for me. I won't forget that. I'm telling everyone I work with to give you a discount, and if you ever need to use the lab, it's yours. If anyone in this city gives you shit, give them my name. It's about to get a lot more respected.}
{244}{}{[他数了数你的报酬]你知道，我不认为这个地方的其他人能像你为我做的那样。我不会忘记的。我告诉所有和我一起工作的人给你一个折扣，如果你需要使用实验室，那就是你的了。如果这个城市有人给你大便，告诉他们我的名字。它将得到更多的尊重。}
#{245}{}{Thank you. And I'll try not to tarnish your good name.}
{245}{}{非常感谢。我会尽量不玷污你的名誉。}
#{246}{}{I can help in the fight, but I'll need a weapon.}
{246}{}{我可以帮忙打仗，但我需要武器。}
#{247}{}{[He makes a gesture, and a henchman gives you a submachine gun in surprisingly good condition] You get the job done, and that's yours to keep. Take two stimpaks, too - Thompson won't go down easy.}
{247}{}{[他做了个手势，一个手下给了你一把状态出奇好的冲锋枪]你完成了任务，那是你的了。再拿两个史汀帕克-汤普森不会轻易倒下的。}
#{248}{}{Thanks, boss.}
{248}{}{谢谢，老板。}
#{249}{}{[He nods] Good to see you.}
{249}{}{很高兴见到你。}
#{250}{}{Now, we got to get to work. I gotta get the business leaders under me while they're still off-balance over Thompson. It's not your kind of work, so I hope you can find something to keep you busy. I won't have any jobs for you for a long time.}
{250}{}{现在，我们得开始工作了。我得让商界领袖们在我的领导下，趁他们对汤普森还不平衡的时候。这不是你喜欢的工作，所以我希望你能找到一些让你忙的事情。我很长时间都没有工作给你了。}
#{251}{}{No problem, boss.}
{251}{}{没问题，老板。}
#{260}{}{I'm curious - where'd you get the weapons for the assualt on Thompson's headquarters?}
{260}{}{我很好奇-你从哪儿弄来的武器？}
#{261}{}{I traded some of the medicine we cooked to the Wind of War for weapons. You picked up some of the chemicals I used for that, remember?}
{261}{}{我把我们为战争之风做的一些药换成了武器。你捡到了一些我用过的化学物质，记得吗？}
#{262}{}{I see.}
{262}{}{我懂了。}
#{300}{}{One phrase: "Dogs should remember who is at each end of the leash."}
{300}{}{一句话：“狗应该记住谁在每一端的皮带。”}
#{301}{}{[His frown tightens as his eyes narrow... And then crumbles into a bemused smirk] What?}
{301}{}{[他眯起眼睛，眉头紧锁...然后摇摇晃晃地傻笑]什么？}
#{302}{}{What do you mean, what? Big Louie said this would remind you.}
{302}{}{你什么意思，什么？大路易说这会提醒你。}
#{303}{}{Don't play stupid. Big Louie wants his tribute.}
{303}{}{别装傻了。大路易想要他的贡品。}
#{304}{}{Uh, maybe I got that wrong. Let me go check with Big Louie and get back to you.}
{304}{}{呃，也许我弄错了。让我去问问大路易，再给你回电。}
#{305}{}{[He crosses his arms and continues smirking] Oh, yeah?}
{305}{}{[他交叉双臂继续微笑]哦，是吗？}
#{306}{}{[Chuckles] Hey everyone, check out this bad motherfucker! Oh, Louie must be *really* mad! [everyone looks at you and snickers]}
{306}{}{嘿，各位，看看这个混蛋！哦，路易一定是疯了！[每个人都看着你窃笑]}
#{307}{}{You're testing Big Louie's patience. That's a bad idea. You're also testing mine. That's worse.}
{307}{}{你在考验大路易的耐心。那是个坏主意。你也在测试我的。那更糟。}
#{308}{}{Yeah, yeah, you're a big man. Just give me the tribute so I can get out of here.}
{308}{}{是啊，是啊，你是个大块头。把贡品给我好让我离开这里。}
#{309}{}{And what if I just throw you out? What then?}
{309}{}{如果我把你扔出去呢？然后呢？}
#{310}{}{Then I pull my weapon and go from room to room, killing everyone I find, until I get what I came for.}
{310}{}{然后我拔出我的武器，从一个房间到另一个房间，杀死所有我找到的人，直到我得到我来的目的。}
#{311}{}{I'll put my foot up your ass for starters. I'll play it by ear from there.}
{311}{}{我先把脚放在你屁股上。我会在那里随机应变。}
#{312}{}{I'll go back to Big Louie, tell him you refused, and wait for his judgment.}
{312}{}{我会回到大路易身边，告诉他你拒绝了，然后等待他的判断。}
#{313}{}{What's with the twenty questions?! Just give me the tribute already!}
{313}{}{这二十个问题是怎么回事？！快把贡品给我！}
#{314}{}{Let me think about it... }
{314}{}{让我想想...}
#{315}{}{[He shakes his head] That wasteland raider shit don't work in the city. You'd better figure that out, fast. [he motions to his henchmen] Bring this goon the tribute. And you, tell Big Louie I didn't forget anything. And I won't forget *this*, either. [he laughs, and you're not sure whether he's laughing at you or Big Louie]}
{315}{}{[他摇摇头]荒地掠夺者那玩意儿在城里不管用。你最好快点想清楚。[他向他的追随者示意]把这个笨蛋带来贡品。你告诉大路易我什么都没忘。我也不会忘记这个。[他笑了，你不确定他是在笑你还是在笑大路易]}
#{316}{}{I thought you'd take your boss more seriously.}
{316}{}{我以为你会更认真地对待你的老板。}
#{317}{}{I'll bring him the package, but I'll think about what happened here. Ciao.}
{317}{}{我会把包裹带给他，但我会考虑这里发生了什么。再见。}
#{318}{}{[He suddenly frowns] The "boss" ran away with his tail between his legs, and left us here to do business. I keep in touch because he might be useful, not because I *have* to. Now get out. You've got what you want.}
{318}{}{[他突然皱眉]“老板”夹着尾巴跑了，把我们留在这里做生意。我保持联系是因为他可能有用，而不是因为我必须这么做。现在出去。你得到了你想要的。}
#{319}{}{Listen, I don't exactly like his gang. Maybe I can work for you instead?}
{319}{}{听着，我不太喜欢他的帮派。也许我可以替你工作？}
#{330}{}{I need some chems for fighting in the ring. The ringleader said I should talk to you.}
{330}{}{我需要一些化学药品在拳击场上战斗。头目说我应该和你谈谈。}
#{331}{}{Hmm. My little man knows his business. If he sent you to me, you must be legit.}
{331}{}{嗯。我的小个子知道他的事。如果他派你来找我，你一定是合法的。}
#{332}{}{Then, will you help me?}
{332}{}{那么，你能帮我吗？}
#{333}{}{If you've got the cash, then you can use my lab. But no one knows it came from me, got it?}
{333}{}{如果你有现金，就可以用我的实验室。但是没人知道是我送的，明白吗？}
#{334}{}{I'm off to the lab, then.}
{334}{}{那我就去实验室。}
#{340}{}{Can you get me into the fallout shelter behind your building?}
{340}{}{你能把我带到你大楼后面的防辐射棚吗？}
#{341}{}{Why should I? I'm the one that locked it up. What the hell do you want in there?}
{341}{}{我为什么要这么做？是我把它锁起来的。你到底想在里面干什么？}
#{342}{}{I'm, uh, interested in the Vaults. I think I can learn more there.}
{342}{}{我对避难所很感兴趣。我想我可以在那里学到更多。}
#{343}{}{[He rolls his eyes] It's just an old evacuation shelter. There's nothing there but rats and rot. If there's anything, it's in the control room, and *no one* can get that open.}
{343}{}{[他翻白眼]这只是一个旧的避难所。那里只有老鼠和腐烂的东西。如果有什么东西的话，就在控制室里，没人能把它打开。}
#{344}{}{If there's nothing in there, then why'd you lock it up?}
{344}{}{如果里面什么都没有，那你为什么要把它锁起来？}
#{345}{}{I'd like to try anyway. Can you unlock it for me?}
{345}{}{我还是想试试。你能帮我打开吗？}
#{346}{}{Fine, for now. We'll discuss this again later.}
{346}{}{好吧，现在。我们稍后再讨论。}
#{347}{}{[He leans forward, glowering] BECAUSE, if we do ever get into that control room, it could be useful for us - thick walls, a radio station, maybe electricity. But people like you would just steal shit or fuck up the place. It would be stupid to just leave it open.}
{347}{}{[他身体前倾，怒目而视]因为，如果我们真的进入控制室，它可能会对我们有用――厚厚的墙，一个电台，也许还有电。但像你这样的人只会偷大便或者搞砸这个地方。把它开着是愚蠢的。}
#{348}{}{Why the fuck would I have put a lock on if I was just gonna give the key to anyone who asks?}
{348}{}{如果我要把钥匙给任何人，我他妈的为什么要把锁锁上？}
#{349}{}{Stryker, you know you can trust me. I won't disappoint you.}
{349}{}{史崔克，你知道你可以相信我。我不会让你失望的。}
#{350}{}{I can make it worth your while. Say... $1000?}
{350}{}{我能让你觉得值得。说...$1000?}
#{351}{}{What would Big Louie say if he knew you were treating his right-hand man like this?}
{351}{}{如果大路易知道你这样对待他的得力助手，他会怎么说？}
#{352}{}{Stryker, please, you're too stressed out about this. I can see it in your handsome face. Would it change your mind if I helped you... Relax?}
{352}{}{史崔克，拜托，你压力太大了。我能从你英俊的脸上看出来。如果我帮你...放松点？}
#{353}{}{No, I *don't* know I can trust you. You haven't earned that yet.}
{353}{}{不，我不知道我能相信你。你还没有得到。}
#{354}{}{Fine, take the key. Don't waste my time with this again.}
{354}{}{好吧，拿着钥匙。别再浪费我的时间了。}
#{355}{}{No problem.}
{355}{}{没问题。}
#{356}{}{[He raises an eyebrow] Fine, but no refunds when you realize there's nothing down there.}
{356}{}{[他扬起眉毛]好吧，但是当你意识到下面什么都没有的时候就不退款了。}
#{357}{}{Take the money.}
{357}{}{把钱拿走。}
#{358}{}{[He looks you up and down] Yeah... I've been working too hard lately. Come with me... }
{358}{}{[他上下打量你]是的...我最近工作太辛苦了。跟我来...}
#{359}{}{Fuck off! This is my headquarters, not a whorehouse! People do *real* work here! And believe me, bitch - I can do a hell of a lot better than you!}
{359}{}{滚开！这是我的总部，不是妓院！人们在这里做真正的工作！相信我，婊子-我能做得比你好多了！}
#{360}{}{[He is neither generous nor gentle. When he's finally finished, your body aches in several places.]}
{360}{}{[他既不慷慨也不温柔。当他最终完成时，你的身体会在几个地方疼痛。]}
#{361}{}{... So will you let me into the bunker?}
{361}{}{... 你能让我进掩体吗？}
#{362}{}{[Follow him.]}
{362}{}{[跟着他。]}
#{370}{}{I represent the Cotton Club. We'd like to make a deal for you to provide protection at an upcoming concert.}
{370}{}{我代表棉花俱乐部。我们想为你做一笔交易，为即将到来的音乐会提供保护。}
#{371}{}{Hmm, reminds me of the old days... Good idea, coming to me with this. Okay, but I want 25% of the concert's proceeds, jurisdiction over the club, and use of its walls for my campaigns.}
{371}{}{嗯，让我想起了过去...好主意，带着这个来找我。好吧，但我要音乐会收入的25%，对俱乐部的管辖权，还有我的竞选活动要用它的墙。}
#{372}{}{We agree to these conditions.}
{372}{}{我们同意这些条件。}
#{373}{}{We'll consider your conditions.}
{373}{}{我们会考虑你的条件。}
#{374}{}{Good. I'll send someone to work out the details.}
{374}{}{很好。我会派人去解决细节问题。}
#{375}{}{That's all.}
{375}{}{这就是全部。}
#{1111}{}{I was just passing by when I saw the place. I thought we might be able to help each other.}
{1111}{}{我刚路过就看到了那个地方。我想我们可以互相帮助。}
#{1112}{}{I want one thing: to work for you.}
{1112}{}{我想要一件事：为你工作。}
#{1113}{}{I just love to learn, you know? I want to know more about you.}
{1113}{}{我只是喜欢学习，你知道吗？我想多了解你。}
#{1126}{}{I already helped you with the Devero situation. Just ask your goons.}
{1126}{}{我已经帮你解决了德维罗的问题。问问你的手下。}
#{1127}{}{I saved one of your people from Bertolini.}
{1127}{}{我从贝托里尼那里救了你的一个人。}
#{1131}{}{I'm ready for serious work, just as long as there's serious pay at the end of it.}
{1131}{}{我已经做好了认真工作的准备，只要最后有认真的报酬就行。}
#{1147}{}{Hmm... That makes sense. Okay, the job's off. Of course, that means no pay.}
{1147}{}{Hmm...这是有道理的。好吧，工作结束了。当然，那意味着没有报酬。}
#{1153}{}{I think it would be better to leave Patrick alive.}
{1153}{}{我想最好让帕特里克活着。}
#{1155}{}{Good. Now I know you're serious about me... Or my money. Either one's good if you get the job done. Here's your pay.}
{1155}{}{很好。现在我知道你对我很认真...或者我的钱。如果你完成了任务，任何一个都是好的。这是你的薪水。}
#{1175}{}{Ahem. My payment?}
{1175}{}{啊哼。我的报酬？}
#{1178}{}{[He points a finger at you without looking up from the photos] Don't interrupt me again. Only warning. [he reaches into a drawer and hands you a wad of bills] Here's your money.}
{1178}{}{[他用手指着你，没有抬头看照片]别再打断我。只是警告而已。[他把手伸进抽屉递给你一沓钞票]这是你的钱。}
#{1180}{}{Yeah, I got something in... [suddenly, a henchman leans over and whispers something in his ear] ... You're sure? Hmm... Didn't see that coming. [he turns to you] No, nothing. You can go.}
{1180}{}{是的，我有东西在里面...[突然，一个心腹俯身在他耳边低语]...你确定？Hmm...没想到会这样。[他转向你]不，没什么。你可以走了。}
#{1182}{}{Yeah, I got something in mind for you. [he crosses his arms and gives you a very serious look] So you've probably figured out I'm trying to get rid of Thompson, yeah? He thinks this city needs a dictator to straighten it out, but he's wrong. You can't just *make* a businessman give you the shirt off his back. A brahmin won't make any milk if you don't feed it, get it? [he leans forward slightly] You undertand, right? This isn't just about money or power. What we're doing here... It's about the city. The future of everyone in Reno depends on us. I want you to know this.}
{1182}{}{是的，我有点事要告诉你。[他交叉双臂，严肃地看了你一眼]那么你可能已经知道我在试图摆脱汤普森，是吗？他认为这个城市需要一个独裁者来整顿，但他错了。你不能让一个商人把他的衬衫给你。一个双头牛如果你不喂它就不会出奶，明白吗？[他微微向前倾]你理解了，对吗？这不仅仅是金钱或权力的问题。我们在这里做什么...是关于城市的。雷诺每个人的未来都取决于我们。我想让你知道这个。}
#{1184}{}{[He pulls out a little box and carefully places it on the table] We did some good things with those chemicals you delivered. This is one of them. They're poisoned contraceptives. You need to slip it to Betty Paige and her whores. Understand?}
{1184}{}{[他拿出一个小盒子，小心地放在桌子上]我们用你送来的那些化学品做了一些好事。这是其中之一。它们是有毒的避孕药。你得把它交给贝蒂・佩奇和她的妓女。明白吗？}
#{1192}{}{[Nods] You've got your orders. You'll be paid after Paige's... Tragic accident. And that better be how it looks, by the way - I don't want this getting traced back to me.}
{1192}{}{[点头]你已经接到命令了。你会在Paige的...悲惨的事故。最好是这样，顺便说一句-我不想让这一切追溯到我身上。}
#{1211}{}{[He gives you a cunning look, then pulls out $100] That's all. Not enough? Then I'm sure you can find another job, since you've been working so many angles in this town. At this point, I need people who are fighting for more than just money. Take your payment and go - I don't need you anymore.}
{1211}{}{[他狡猾地看了你一眼，然后掏出100美元]仅此而已。还不够？那么我相信你能找到另一份工作，因为你在这个镇上工作了这么多角度。在这一点上，我需要的不仅仅是为了钱而战斗的人。拿着你的钱走吧-我不再需要你了。}
#{1215}{}{Finally! So, what do I have to do to get rich?}
{1215}{}{终于！那么，我要怎么做才能发财呢？}
#{1229}{}{Yeah, seriously! You delivered the last one, didn't you? Big Louie needs chems, guns and ammo for his gang. He's practically begging. I need them too, but I can spare enough to maintain our relationship.}
{1229}{}{是啊，说真的！你送了最后一个，是吗？大路易需要化学药品，枪支和弹药。他简直是在乞讨。我也需要他们，但我可以拿出足够的钱来维持我们的关系。}
#{1261}{}{I traded some of the medicine we cooked to the Wind of War for weapons. You picked up some of the chemicals I used for that, remember?}
{1261}{}{我把我们为战争之风做的一些药换成了武器。你捡到了一些我用过的化学物质，记得吗？}
#{1301}{}{[His frown tightens as his eyes narrow... And then crumbles into a bemused smirk] What?}
{1301}{}{[他眯起眼睛，眉头紧锁...然后摇摇晃晃地傻笑]什么？}
#{1305}{}{[He crosses his arms and continues smirking] Oh, yeah?}
{1305}{}{[他交叉双臂继续微笑]哦，是吗？}
#{1310}{}{Then I pull my weapon and go room to room, killing everyone I find, until I get what I came for.}
{1310}{}{然后我拔出我的武器，一个房间一个房间，杀死所有我找到的人，直到我得到我想要的。}
#{1318}{}{[He suddenly frowns] The "boss" ran away with his tail between his legs, and left us here to do business. I keep in touch because he might be useful, not because I *have* to. Now get out. You've got what you want.}
{1318}{}{[他突然皱眉]“老板”夹着尾巴跑了，把我们留在这里做生意。我保持联系是因为他可能有用，而不是因为我必须这么做。现在出去。你得到了你想要的。}
#{1347}{}{[He leans forward, glowering] BECAUSE, if we do ever get into that control room, it could be useful for us - thick walls, a radio station, maybe electricity. But people like you would just steal shit or fuck up the place. It would be stupid to just leave it open.}
{1347}{}{[他身体前倾，怒目而视]因为，如果我们真的进入控制室，它可能会对我们有用――厚厚的墙，一个电台，也许还有电。但像你这样的人只会偷大便或者搞砸这个地方。把它开着是愚蠢的。}
#{1351}{}{What would Big Louie say if he knew you were treating me this way?}
{1351}{}{如果大路易知道你这样对我，他会怎么说？}
#{1353}{}{No, I *don't* know I can trust you. You haven't earned that yet.}
{1353}{}{不，我不知道我能相信你。你还没有得到。}
