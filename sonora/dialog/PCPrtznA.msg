#Dialog
### {200}{}{I am surprised by your visit. Few people know about this place, and traps scare away even the most experienced. But you're here. And it's pretty damn inspiring. What brought you to our Party?}
{200}{}{我对你的来访感到惊讶。很少有人知道这个地方，陷阱甚至吓跑了最有经验的人。但你在这里。这真是太鼓舞人心了。是什么把你带到我们党来的？}
### {201}{}{A party? Yes, I'm here by accident. And what do you do in general?}
{201}{}{派对？是的，我是偶然来到这里的。你一般做什么？}
### {202}{}{Are you saying that you managed to find this box and circumvent our traps solely out of luck? It sounds very doubtful. But now there is no point in hiding - we are fighting against the Followers of Fire and their leader Aaron. What do you think about it?}
{202}{}{你是说你找到这个盒子并绕过我们的陷阱完全是运气使然吗？这听起来很可疑。但现在没有必要躲藏了――我们正在与火的追随者和他们的领袖亚伦作战。你觉得怎么样？}

### {211}{}{You are ordinary criminals. You need to be stopped.}
{211}{}{你们是普通罪犯。你需要被阻止。}
### {212}{}{Hmm, so far I like you. Since we have common interests, I hope for your cooperation. Will you help in our fight?}

{216}{}{听到这样的回答我感到非常抱歉。第一印象总是骗人的。}
### {217}{}{I won't tell anyone. I promise.}
{217}{}{我不会告诉任何人。我保证。}
### {218}{}{And you're more perceptive than you seem. I'll have to eliminate you.}
{218}{}{而且你比看上去更有洞察力。我将不得不淘汰你。}
### {219}{}{I'm afraid this answer doesn't suit me. Capture the spy!}
{219}{}{恐怕这个答案不适合我。抓住那个间谍！}
### {220}{}{Oh...}
{220}{}{哦}
### {221}{}{It was in vain...}
{221}{}{这是徒劳的。。。}
### {222}{}{Why don't I just leave and we'll forget about everything that happened here?}
{222}{}{我为什么不离开，我们就会忘记这里发生的一切？}
### {223}{}{You don't expect to leave here without consequences, do you? Let's see what happens.}
{223}{}{你不希望在没有后果的情况下离开这里，是吗？让我们看看会发生什么。}
### {224}{}{Uh, I think I'll just leave. Bye.}
{224}{}{呃，我想我就走吧。再见}
### {225}{}{I want to join your Party.}
{225}{}{我想加入你们党。}
### {226}{}{Very good. But we can't risk trusting the first person we meet. Tell me about yourself. Who are you and how do you know about the Liberation Party?}
{226}{}{很好。但我们不能冒险相信我们遇到的第一个人。告诉我你自己。你是谁？你对解放党了解多少？}
### {227}{}{I'm looking for my family. They were enslaved and brought to this city. I need help finding them.}
{227}{}{我在找我的家人。他们被奴役并被带到这座城市。我需要帮助找到他们。}
### {228}{}{In fact, I'm on the lookout for dubious dangerous types that need to be eliminated. And it looks like I found them.}
{228}{}{事实上，我正在寻找需要消除的可疑危险类型。看起来我找到了它们。}
### {1228}{}{In fact, I'm on the lookout for dubious dangerous types that need to be eliminated. And it looks like I found them.}
{1228}{}{事实上，我正在寻找需要消除的可疑危险类型。看起来我找到了它们。}
### {229}{}{ (nods significantly) I understand you. Everyone here has lost someone. Apparently, our paths did not meet by chance. After all, few people know that the main customer for slave labor is a sect of fire worshippers. We are fighting against these bastards. We should join forces.}
{229}{}{（明显点头）我理解你。这里的每个人都失去了一个人。显然，我们的相遇并非偶然。毕竟，很少有人知道奴隶劳动的主要客户是一个拜火派。我们正在与这些混蛋作战。我们应该联合起来。}
### {230}{}{Hmm-m. Take a look around and get to know the team while I figure out a plan.}
{230}{}{嗯。在我制定计划的同时，四处看看，了解一下团队。}
### {231}{}{OK.}
{231}{}{好啊}

{251}{}{回头见。}

### {260}{}{Tell us about your organization.}
{260}{}{告诉我们您的组织。}
### {261}{}{We are the Phoenix Liberation Party. Our goal is to rid the city of Aaron's power and undermine the false church.}
{261}{}{我们是凤凰解放党。我们的目标是摆脱亚伦的权力，破坏虚假的教会。}
### {262}{}{Why did you call the church false?}
{262}{}{你为什么说教堂是假的？}
### {263}{}{Fire worshippers misinterpret the old religion, trying to justify the inhumane actions of their leader. They forgot about the pre-war covenants.}
{263}{}{火崇拜者曲解了古老的宗教，试图为他们的领袖的不人道行为辩护。他们忘记了战前的盟约。}
### {264}{}{Why is it so important for you to overthrow Aaron?}
{264}{}{为什么推翻亚伦对你来说如此重要？}
### {265}{}{Without its leader, the church will fall in the eyes of the city.}
{265}{}{如果没有它的领袖，教堂将在城市的眼中倒塌。}
### {266}{}{And what are you going to do after you achieve your goal?}
{266}{}{当你达到目标后，你打算做什么？}
### {267}{}{Building a new society. A society based on community and equality, not on separation and subordination.}
{267}{}{建设一个新社会。一个建立在社区和平等基础上的社会，而不是建立在分离和从属基础上的。}
### {268}{}{Thank you. Now I know enough.}
{268}{}{非常感谢。现在我知道的够多了。}

### {270}{}{Tell me about your past.}
{270}{}{告诉我你的过去。}
### {271}{}{It doesn't matter.}
{271}{}{没关系。}
### {272}{}{Whatever you say.}
{272}{}{不管你说什么。}
### {273}{}{We have to trust each other, don't we?}
{273}{}{我们必须互相信任，不是吗？}
### {274}{}{Sure, but don't forget we're not here for a party.}
{274}{}{当然，但别忘了我们不是来参加聚会的。}
### {275}{}{Yeah, uh, it's over.}
{275}{}{是的，呃，结束了。}
### {276}{}{I was born a few years ago when Aaron came to power in the city. The man I was before is dead.}
{276}{}{我出生在几年前，当时亚伦在这个城市掌权。我以前的那个人死了。}
### {277}{}{Surely there was a personal reason for this. Have you lost someone close to you?}
{277}{}{这当然有个人原因。你失去了亲近的人吗？}
### {278}{}{And you are more perceptive than you seem. When he came to power, Aaron destroyed all the objectionable ones who could have prevented him and whom he could reach. Punitive bonfires lit up the whole city.}
{278}{}{而且你比看上去更有洞察力。当他掌权时，亚伦摧毁了所有本可以阻止他的人和他能接触到的人。惩罚性的篝火照亮了整个城市。}
### {279}{}{[Next]}
{279}{}{[下一个]}
### {280}{}{Many then lost their loved ones. But, as I said, the past doesn't matter.}
{280}{}{许多人随后失去了他们的亲人。但是，正如我所说，过去并不重要。}
### {281}{}{Why was this tolerated?}
{281}{}{为什么这是可以容忍的？}
### {282}{}{There was a famine in Phoenix then. Getting rid of extra mouths and oppressing the weak was to many's advantage. Aaron himself is only trying to strengthen himself in power, and all this church nonsense attaches importance to his words.}
{282}{}{当时凤凰城发生饥荒。摆脱多余的嘴巴和压迫弱者对许多人有利。亚伦本人只是想在权力上加强自己，所有这些教会的胡言乱语都重视他的话。}
### {283}{}{Ugh, it must have been a tragedy for the city. Now let's talk about today.}
{283}{}{啊，这对这个城市来说一定是一场悲剧。现在我们来谈谈今天。}

{302}{}{好的，我和她谈谈。}

{303}{}{我需要我们战斗的装备。}
### {304}{}{Talk to Alice about it, she's in charge of the warehouse, I'm busy with more important issues.}

### {311}{}{Well, if you say so.}
{311}{}{好吧，如果你这么说的话。}
### {312}{}{Oh, I'm really cooler than all your fighters. Don't doubt it.}
{312}{}{哦，我真的比你们所有的战士都酷。不要怀疑。}
### {313}{}{It is a pity that our agent could not be saved. But perhaps it's for the best, because no one knows what information he could tell the sectarians.}
{313}{}{很遗憾，我们的代理人没能得救。但也许这是最好的，因为没有人知道他能告诉宗派主义者什么信息。}
### {314}{}{Leaving him in the clutches of the monks would be too risky. It was the only way out.}
{314}{}{把他丢在僧侣手里太冒险了。这是唯一的出路。}
### {315}{}{Actually, I had nothing to do with it. It just so happened.}

### {321}{}{What are you up to?}
{321}{}{你在干什么？}
### {322}{}{Thanks to the signal booster, we learned a lot about sectarians. A rumor has been confirmed that there are secret levels under the cathedral. We don't know what the monks are doing there. But there are rumors that they are collecting powerful weapons. This is unacceptable.}
{322}{}{多亏了信号增强器，我们学到了很多关于宗派主义的知识。有传言说大教堂下面有秘密的楼层。我们不知道僧侣们在那里做什么。但是有传言说他们正在收集强大的武器。这是不可接受的。}
### {323}{}{Are you suggesting we get in there and destroy the weapons? But HOW?}
{323}{}{你是不是建议我们进去销毁武器？但是怎么做呢？}
### {324}{}{There is a person in the cathedral who sympathizes with our ideas. His name is Mathias. However, he has his own scores with Aaron, and it is impossible to call him our agent in any way. Your task is to contact Mathias and get further instructions from him.}
{324}{}{大教堂里有一个人同情我们的想法。他的名字叫马蒂亚斯。然而，他和亚伦有自己的得分，无论如何都不可能称他为我们的经纪人。你的任务是联系Mathias并从他那里得到进一步的指示。}
### {325}{}{The task is clear.}
{325}{}{任务很明确。}
### {326}{}{Good luck. The city can no longer tolerate Aaron's unlimited power.}
{326}{}{祝你好运这座城市再也不能容忍亚伦的无限权力了。}
### {327}{}{Contact Mathias, infiltrate the lab and destroy the weapon. Clear.}
{327}{}{联系马蒂亚斯，潜入实验室并销毁武器。清楚的}
### {328}{}{There is a person in the cathedral who sympathizes with our ideas. His name is Mathias. However, he has his own scores with Aaron, so it is impossible to call him our agent in any way. Your task is to contact Mathias so that we can prepare for the capture of the cathedral. He will give further instructions.}
{328}{}{大教堂里有一个人同情我们的想法。他的名字叫马蒂亚斯。然而，他和亚伦有自己的得分，所以无论如何都不可能称他为我们的经纪人。你的任务是联系马蒂亚斯，这样我们就可以为占领大教堂做准备。他将作出进一步指示。}

{329}{}{再见，马科斯。}

### {330}{}{Aaron is defeated.}
{330}{}{亚伦被打败了。}
### {331}{}{Wonderful news! But that's not enough. We have to destroy the WHOLE cult. As long as Aaron's followers are alive, this fight will not end. Moreover, it is unknown what decisions the new leaders of the church will make.}
{331}{}{好消息！但这还不够。我们必须摧毁整个邪教。只要亚伦的追随者还活着，这场战斗就不会结束。此外，还不知道教会的新领导人会做出什么决定。}
### {332}{}{What to do?}
{332}{}{该怎么办？}
### {333}{}{This news does not change your main mission - to get into the secret lair under the Cathedral and destroy it with the help of local weapons. Our agent, Mathias, will help you. Good luck, comrade.}
{333}{}{这个消息不会改变你的主要任务――进入大教堂下的秘密巢穴，并在当地武器的帮助下摧毁它。我们的经纪人马蒂亚斯会帮你的。祝你好运，同志。}
