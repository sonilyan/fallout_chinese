{100}{}{Let's go! I'll cover you.}
{101}{}{Don't worry, I'll watch your back.}
{102}{}{Let's get going.}
{103}{}{We don't have time to talk. You lead, I'll follow.}
#
{104}{}{I'll keep an eye on the inmates.}
{105}{}{I hope this never happens again.}
{106}{}{We should wait here until the situation settles down.}
{107}{}{Watch yourself, you hear me!}
{108}{}{Search this place, find some weapons.}
{109}{}{Take whatever you can carry.}
{110}{}{You're on your own, we'll stay here because it's safer.}
#
{111}{}{Excellent work, friend! My men have set the explosive charges all over the place. We're going to blow this
 place to pieces. I hope you brought your stuff because once the timer is on, there's no turning back.}
{112}{}{Can you wait a minute? I have to check something.}
{113}{}{Yep, I'm good. Let's go...}
#come again...
{114}{}{This whole place is wired up, there's no more time... Run for cover!}
{115}{}{[Exit.]}
#guards killed
{116}{}{That was the last. Only thing left is the underground base. I suggest you take a look around, check for
 equipment and anyone that remains. We stay here and make sure none of the rats slip through. And then we blow this
 hellhole to smithereens.}
{117}{}{OK, but don't do anything rash.}
