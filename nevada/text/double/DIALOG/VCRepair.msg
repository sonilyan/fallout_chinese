#{271}{}{Hmm... [scratches his head] Curious thing. Except it's far too advanced for me. I think my mate, biker Phil can figure it out. But I don't know how to get in touch with him.}
{271}{}{隐马尔可夫模型。。。[挠头]奇怪的事。只是对我来说太高级了。我想我的朋友，摩托车手菲尔能搞定。但我不知道怎么和他联系。 -- Hmm... [scratches his head] Curious thing. Except it's far too advanced for me. I think my mate, biker Phil can figure it out. But I don't know how to get in touch with him.}
#{272}{}{Thanks for the tip.}
{272}{}{谢谢你的小费。 -- Thanks for the tip.}
#{273}{}{Thanks for the tip. Is there anything else that can help me find this, Phil?}
{273}{}{谢谢你的小费。还有什么能帮我找到这个吗，菲尔？ -- Thanks for the tip. Is there anything else that can help me find this, Phil?}
#{274}{}{Well, he, like the other bikers, doesn't have a place to call home, so he pokes his head into Vegas from time to time. Although, I heard something about their base being somewhere up north. The only large city that way is Salt Lake City. Maybe someone there will know more.}
{274}{}{嗯，他和其他骑车人一样，没有地方叫家，所以他时不时地把头伸进维加斯。不过，我听说他们的基地在北方某个地方。唯一的大城市是盐湖城。也许那里的人会知道更多。 -- Well, he, like the other bikers, doesn't have a place to call home, so he pokes his head into Vegas from time to time.

#{300}{}{Hm. I know another fan of tech - Jay Kukish...}
{300}{}{嗯。我认识另一个科技迷-杰伊・库基什。。。 -- Hm. I know another fan of tech - Jay Kukish...}
#{301}{}{Well, I'm not surprised. There aren't many people in Vegas who bikers could talk to about tech. They're crazy about it. Jay was here not so long ago, he was asking about a strange device. But, I couldn't help him.}
{301}{}{我一点也不惊讶。在维加斯，很少有人能和骑自行车的人谈论科技。他们对科技很着迷。杰伊不久前还在这里，他在问一个奇怪的装置。但是，我帮不了他。 -- Well, I'm not surprised. There aren't many people in Vegas who bikers could talk to about tech. They're crazy about it. Jay was here not so long ago, he was asking about a strange device. But, I couldn't help him.}
#{302}{}{What device?}
{302}{}{什么设备？ -- What device?}
#{303}{}{You know, something like a database that works based on crystals. It's got these defensive layers. I couldn't even go through the first one. But, the thing was fascinating.}
{303}{}{你知道，就像一个基于晶体的数据库。它有这些防御层。我连第一个都看不懂。但是，事情很有趣。 -- You know, something like a database that works based on crystals. It's got these defensive layers. I couldn't even go through the first one. But, the thing was fascinating.}
#{304}{}{Why do you think Jay needs it?}
{304}{}{你觉得杰伊为什么需要它？ -- Why do you think Jay needs it?}
#{305}{}{I don't think he knows himself. Looks like he's trying to figure out what it's for. Pre-war tech is like his life purpose. He believes that technology must be kept away from common hands, and be used only by a small and capable group of people.}
{305}{}{我认为他不了解自己。看起来他想弄清楚这是干什么用的。战前的科技就像他的人生目标。他认为，技术必须远离普通人，只能由一小部分有能力的人使用。 -- I don't think he knows himself. Looks like he's trying to figure out what it's for. Pre-war tech is like his life purpose. He believes that technology must be kept away from common hands, and be used only by a small and capable group of people.}
