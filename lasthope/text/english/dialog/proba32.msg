{100}{}{Nice day for killing.}
{101}{}{I'm on my twelfth jag. What about you?}
{102}{}{Got any bullets left?}
{103}{}{Not much left to do here. ::grins::}
{104}{}{We are a most organized gang.}
{105}{}{I can hit a kid from over sixty yards away.}
{106}{}{I was shot twice, but it's nothing.}
{107}{}{Killed anyone recently? What a relief. Am I right?}
{108}{}{When did you join?}
{109}{}{Check out that guy at the gun store, he can't breathe!}
