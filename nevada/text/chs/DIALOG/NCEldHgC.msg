#{101}{}{To you, he just looks like a shifty guy, but he's really got Bertolini riled up.}
{101}{}{对你来说，他只是看起来像个狡猾的家伙，但他真的激怒了贝托里尼。}
#{110}{}{That kid doesn't have what it takes, I get that. But what's stopping you?}
{110}{}{我明白，那孩子没有能力。但什么阻止了你？}
#{111}{}{I've got an nose for opportunity, and your boss reeks of it. How about we do each other a favor?}
{111}{}{我对机会有敏锐的嗅觉，而你的老板却闻到了机会的味道。我们互相帮个忙怎么样？}
#{112}{}{Nothing. I just wanted to see if you had any final words.}

#{117}{}{You're not from around here, are you? That attitude's a good way to end up dead in the gutter... Look, you don't want to work for Bertolini. He's just a greedy businessman who thinks he's a gangster. If you want to make a real difference, I can put in a good word with my boss. No promises, but I think he'd want a man like you.}
{117}{}{你不是本地人吧？这种态度是一个很好的方式，最终死在阴沟里。。。听着，你不想为贝托里尼工作。他只是个贪婪的商人，自以为是黑帮分子。如果你真想有所作为，我可以和老板说句好话。没有承诺，但我想他会想要一个像你这样的男人。}
#{118}{}{I'll keep that in mind. Now go, before someone notices.}
