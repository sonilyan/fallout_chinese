#Dialog
### {200}{}{Marcos has given you permission to be at headquarters. But don't think that it immediately gives you confidence. Earn it by deeds and watch your tongue.}
{200}{}{马科斯允许你去总部。但不要认为这会立刻给你信心。通过行动赢得它，注意你的舌头。}
### {201}{}{Of course I understand.}
{201}{}{我当然理解。}
### {202}{}{Given your reception, there is no need to talk about trust.}
{202}{}{考虑到你的接待，没有必要谈论信任。}

{211}{}{回头见，姐姐。}

### {220}{}{Tell me about yourself.}

### {221}{}{It is not customary for us to talk about our past. We are gathered here not for the sake of communication, but for the sake of a common cause.}
{221}{}{我们不习惯谈论我们的过去。我们聚集在这里不是为了交流，而是为了共同的事业。}
### {222}{}{How did you get into this movement?}
{222}{}{你是如何进入这场运动的？}
### {223}{}{Of course, I'm sorry.}

### {224}{}{I'm telling you, it doesn't matter. I will only say that initially I had personal motives. Now I'm fighting for an idea, it's much higher.}
{224}{}{我告诉你，这没关系。我只想说，最初我有个人动机。现在我正在为一个想法而奋斗，它要高得多。}
### {225}{}{A sad story. Do you mind if I ask you something else?}
{225}{}{一个悲伤的故事。你介意我问你别的问题吗？}
### {226}{}{Tell me about Marcos.}
{226}{}{告诉我关于马科斯的事。}
### {227}{}{He is a great man.}
{227}{}{他是个伟人。}
### {228}{}{Um, is that it?}
{228}{}{嗯，就是这样吗？}
### {229}{}{Well, he has a dark past. I only know that before the creation of the Party, he experienced some kind of tragedy.}
{229}{}{嗯，他有一段黑暗的过去。我只知道，在建党之前，他经历过某种悲剧。}
### {230}{}{Are you in love with him?}
{230}{}{你爱上他了吗？}
### {231}{}{Wh... how... listen, of course I admire him as a leader. After all, he gathered so many people under a common noble goal. But I don't even know his face, he never took off his balaclava in front of me.}
{231}{}{为什么。。。怎样听着，作为一个领导者，我当然钦佩他。毕竟，他把这么多人聚集在一个共同的崇高目标之下。但我甚至不知道他的脸，他从来没有在我面前摘下巴拉克拉瓦帽。}

### {239}{}{What is this place?}

### {240}{}{Once it was an underground tram station. The passageways collapsed during the nuclear bombing, leaving only an exit to the sewer. Therefore, few people can find this place.}
{240}{}{它曾经是一个地下电车站。通道在核轰炸期间倒塌，只留下一个通往下水道的出口。因此，很少有人能找到这个地方。}

#Issue of equipment

### {252}{}{Nothing now. We will return to this a little later.}
{252}{}{现在什么都没有。我们稍后再讨论这个问题。}
### {253}{}{If this is not enough, then you can contact a gun store in downtown. The owner sells us the goods in secret from the sectarians. Just tell him the code phrase: "There are no people more loyal to the emperor than a handful of peasants."}
{253}{}{如果这还不够，你可以联系市中心的枪支商店。店主向宗派主义者秘密卖给我们这些货物。只要告诉他一句暗语：“没有比少数农民更忠于皇帝的人了。”}

{260}{}{继续下去不是太冒险了吗？好吧，你和马科斯更清楚。这是一把冲锋枪和一盒10毫米口径的子弹。还要带上几颗手榴弹和一个刺激包，以防受伤。}
### {261}{}{Equipment for espionage.}
{261}{}{间谍设备。}

{276}{}{考虑到我救了党的特工，你本可以对我更忠诚。}
### {277}{}{Your truth. Sorry, there's too much going on right now. And yet it would be fair to donate a hundred caps to our cause.}
{277}{}{你的真相。对不起，现在事情太多了。然而，为我们的事业捐赠一百顶帽子是公平的。}
### {278}{}{Here are a hundred caps...}
{278}{}{这里有一百顶帽子。。。}
### {279}{}{Here are 350 caps...}
{279}{}{这里有350顶帽子。。。}

#Tasks
### {300}{}{Marcos sent me to the surface. What should I do?}
{300}{}{马科斯让我浮出水面。我该怎么办？}
### {301}{}{Okay, listen carefully. One of our agents went to the ruins on the surface to install a radio beacon. Since then, the connection with him has been lost. We don't know what happened. Find him and finish his job.}
{301}{}{好的，仔细听。我们的一名特工前往地面废墟安装了一个无线电信标。从那时起，与他的联系就消失了。我们不知道发生了什么。找到他，完成他的工作。}
### {302}{}{Why do you need a beacon on the ruins?}
{302}{}{你为什么需要废墟上的灯塔？}
### {303}{}{We use radio communication for our own negotiations and wiretapping of sectarians. But the signal is jammed underground. That's why we need an amplifier on the surface.}

### {305}{}{Will they give me equipment?}

### {322}{}{I'm going to deal with this issue.}
{322}{}{我要处理这个问题。}
### {323}{}{The lost agent was ambushed by the monks. But I managed to get him out.}

### {334}{}{I couldn't find it. Maybe he ran away?}

### {335}{}{It is more likely that he was captured by sectarians. Try to find out what happened to him while I'm dealing with this equipment.}
{335}{}{更有可能的是，他被宗派主义者抓走了。当我处理这些设备时，试着找出他发生了什么事。}
### {336}{}{OK, I'll take care of this issue.}
{336}{}{好的，我来处理这个问题。}
### {337}{}{Great job. Now it will be easier for us to listen to the fire worshippers' broadcasts. Tell Marcos about your success.}
