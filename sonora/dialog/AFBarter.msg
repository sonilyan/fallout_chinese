### {102}{}{Hide behind the counter. I don't think these dead people will find us here.}
{102}{}{躲在柜台后面。我不认为这些死人会在这里找到我们。}

### {200}{}{Hello, se?or. How can I help you?}

### {210}{}{Where can I buy nuclear batteries for a boat here?}
{210}{}{我在哪里可以买到船用的核电池？}
### {211}{}{None of the pescadores will sell their stocks - they themselves do not have enough. The nearest place where we get batteries for boats and a generator is Puerto Penasco. Try to buy there.}

### {214}{}{Which one?}
{214}{}{哪一个？}
### {215}{}{I've been asking the knights from Puerto to send me a new Geiger counter for a long time. But when it comes to technology, they become terrible misers. By the time I wait for a new meter from them, we will all have time to die from radiation. Joke. But if you bring me a new meter, I'll exchange it for a battery. Or I'll pay with clean caps.}
{215}{}{很长一段时间以来，我一直要求来自波多黎各的骑士们给我寄一个新的盖革计数器。但当涉及到技术时，他们变成了可怕的吝啬鬼。当我等待他们提供新的测量仪时，我们都有时间死于辐射。笑话但如果你给我带一个新电表，我会把它换成电池。否则我会用干净的帽子付款。}
### {216}{}{I will keep in mind.}
{216}{}{我会记住的。}
### {217}{}{You're lucky. I just have one such counter, and I don't need it.}

### {221}{}{A nuclear battery.}
{221}{}{一个核电池。}
### {222}{}{bottlecaps.}
{222}{}{装瓶。}
### {223}{}{Take it for free. It's a gift to make the world cleaner.}

### {240}{}{Hilberto says you've been to Inferno?}
{240}{}{希尔伯托说你去过地狱？}
### {241}{}{A scary place. Burnt ruins and... human BONES are all around.}
{241}{}{一个可怕的地方。烧毁的废墟和。。。人类的骨头无处不在。}
### {242}{}{Wow, can you tell me more? I'm going there for one task.}
{242}{}{哇，你能告诉我更多吗？我要去那里执行一项任务。}
### {243}{}{It's creepy. Don't even go on, I don't want to hear it.}
{243}{}{令人毛骨悚然。别说了，我不想听。}
### {244}{}{Do you really want to know? To be honest, I don't like to talk about it. But I'll make an exception for you.}
{244}{}{你真的想知道吗？老实说，我不喜欢谈论它。但我会为你破例的。}
### {245}{}{So what kind of dangers are waiting there?}
{245}{}{那么，还有什么样的危险在等待着呢？}
### {246}{}{Do you really want to know? To be honest, I don't like to talk about it. So are you going to order something or not?}

### {247}{}{Here are 20 caps for tea. I want to hear your story.}
{247}{}{这里有20顶茶帽。我想听你的故事。}
### {248}{}{I don't have any caps right now. Maybe another time.}
{248}{}{我现在没有帽子。也许改天吧。}
### {249}{}{I was looking for useful things there. These ruins haven't been looted by looters like in Phoenix yet, so there are plenty of old relics there. But it is extremely dangerous to get them because of radiation and collapses. Half the way I made my way through underground passages. There, by the way, you can hide from radiation for a while.}
{249}{}{我在那里找有用的东西。这些废墟还没有像凤凰城那样被抢劫者洗劫过，所以那里有很多古老的遗迹。但由于辐射和坍塌，得到它们是极其危险的。走到一半的时候，我穿过地下通道。顺便说一句，在那里，你可以躲避一段时间的辐射。}
### {250}{}{Go on.}
{250}{}{继续}
### {251}{}{But the most terrible thing is the demons.}
{251}{}{但最可怕的是恶魔。}
### {252}{}{Demons?}
{252}{}{魔鬼？}
### {253}{}{The souls of the dead in the nuclear flame. The walking dead, they have lost their sanity and human appearance. Fortunately, they rarely go to the outskirts of the ruins.}
{253}{}{核火焰中死者的灵魂。行尸走肉，他们失去了理智和人性。幸运的是，他们很少去废墟的郊区。}
### {254}{}{You must have suffered there for the rest of your life.}
{254}{}{你一定在那里度过了余生。}
### {255}{}{Many scavengers died at the hands of demons or radiation. Therefore, you should be more careful - stock up on drugs and a good gun, if you haven't lost the desire to go there yet.}
{255}{}{许多拾荒者死于恶魔或辐射之手。因此，如果你还没有失去去那里的欲望，你应该更加小心――储备毒品和一把好枪。}
### {256}{}{Good. Thanks for the tips.}
{256}{}{好的谢谢你的提示。}
### {257}{}{I will not be intimidated by this.}
{257}{}{我不会被这件事吓倒。}
### {258}{}{Judging by your appearance, you already know everything.}
{258}{}{从你的外表来看，你已经无所不知了。}
### {259}{}{Caught him. Okay, let's change the subject.}
{259}{}{抓住他了。好吧，让我们换个话题。}

### {260}{}{Listen, what do you know about the treasure that Ruiz is looking for?}
{260}{}{听着，你对鲁伊斯正在寻找的宝藏了解多少？}
### {261}{}{Don't mess with that weasel. He is a cunning and dangerous man. And this treasure is doubtful. No one even knows if he really exists.}
{261}{}{别惹那个黄鼠狼。他是一个狡猾而危险的人。这个宝藏令人怀疑。甚至没有人知道他是否真的存在。}
### {262}{}{Have you tried to find him?}
{262}{}{你试着找到他了吗？}
### {263}{}{I only have one piece from the treasure map. Ruiz won't give up his part of the map for anything. And where the others are, I do not know.}
{263}{}{我只有一张藏宝图。鲁伊斯不会为了任何事情而放弃他在地图上的位置。其他人在哪里，我不知道。}
### {264}{}{Maybe you can sell me your part?}
{264}{}{也许你可以把你的角色卖给我？}
### {265}{}{Hmm, on the other hand, there is still an opportunity to find the treasure. So I will sell, but for a very good price. Say for }
{265}{}{嗯，另一方面，还是有机会找到宝藏的。所以我会卖，但价格很好。为…说话}
### {266}{}{ caps.}
{266}{}{帽子。}
### {267}{}{I'll pay. Here are the bottlecaps.}
{267}{}{我会付钱的。这是水瓶。}
### {268}{}{How much? Well, no. Keep this piece of paper for yourself.}
{268}{}{多少钱？不，这张纸你自己留着。}
### {269}{}{No, that's not enough. Come back when you dig up. I also want to make money on someone else's greed.}
{269}{}{不，这还不够。挖出来的时候再来。我也想靠别人的贪婪赚钱。}
### {270}{}{Uh, okay. I'll be back with the caps...}
{270}{}{好吧。我会带着帽子回来。。。}
### {271}{}{(enthusiastically counts the caps) It looks like I'm going to exhaust my entire year's supply of luck today! Here is my part of the map. Good luck in finding the treasure. You'll need it.}
{271}{}{（热情地数着帽子）看起来我今天要耗尽我一整年的运气了！这是我的那部分地图。祝你好运，找到宝藏。你会需要它的。}
### {272}{}{Later.}
{272}{}{后来}

### {280}{}{Hey, you know what happened to Johnny?}
{280}{}{嘿，你知道强尼怎么了吗？}
### {281}{}{Yes, everyone already knows. Rumors spread quickly. It's terrible. I never thought that in our village someone would raise a hand against a person.}
{281}{}{是的，每个人都已经知道了。谣言迅速传开。太可怕了。我从没想过在我们村里会有人举手反对一个人。}
### {282}{}{Who do you think it could be?}
{282}{}{你认为可能是谁？}
### {283}{}{I don't know. Johnny was everyone's favorite. Only Ruiz treated him coolly. But he hates everyone in general. Also this comical guy... Tin-Tan, sort of. I think Johnny was avoiding him. Which is strange, because Johnny used to be very happy that his uncle was about to arrive from Phoenix. And after his arrival, the kid seemed to have been replaced.}
{283}{}{我不知道。约翰尼是每个人的最爱。只有鲁伊斯对他冷淡。但他讨厌所有人。还有这个滑稽的家伙。。。天坛，有点像。我觉得强尼在躲避他。这很奇怪，因为约翰尼过去很高兴他的叔叔即将从凤凰城来。在他到达后，这个孩子似乎被替换了。}
### {284}{}{Is he really from Phoenix?}
{284}{}{他真的来自凤凰城吗？}
### {285}{}{Well yes. His documents are in order. All documents were processed in Sonora Express. However, there is no branch in our wilderness. That's why the caravans take correspondence to Casa Nueva when we want to send it to Phoenix.}
{285}{}{是的。他的文件井然有序。所有文件都在Sonora Express中处理。然而，在我们的荒野中没有分支。这就是为什么当我们想把信件寄给凤凰城时，大篷车会把信件寄给Casa Nueva。}
### {286}{}{Casa Nueva or Phoenix? Well, thank you.}
{286}{}{努瓦之家还是凤凰城？好吧，谢谢你。}
### {287}{}{Hey, you didn't order anything!}
{287}{}{嘿，你什么都没点！}
### {1287}{}{Hey, you didn't order anything!}
{1287}{}{嘿，你什么都没点！}
### {288}{}{You will manage.}
{288}{}{你会成功的。}
### {289}{}{Sorry, here are 5 caps for tea.}
{289}{}{对不起，这里有5顶茶帽。}
