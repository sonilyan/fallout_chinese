{106}{}{Yeah, what the hell do you want?}
{107}{}{What can you tell me about your "organization"?}
{108}{}{I want to buy some... servants?}
{109}{}{Nothing, I'm out of here.}
#about "organization"...
{110}{}{I would call it an association of free lancers. Most of us were criminals of some sort, brought together only by
 a sense for profit, nothing more. Our daily routine begins with the hunting down of these savages all across the
 wasteland. My customers are always looking for new servants and workers, so business is flourishing... except for that
 crabgrass called mayor Donson. That bastard keeps raising taxes every time I ask for a favor... This is fucking
 annoying because might as well declare a fucking bankruptcy!}
{111}{}{I heard you, let me as you something else.}
#buy slaves...
{112}{}{No offense man but I don't think you can afford any of these servants. They are well trained... well, you
 have to whip them a bit [smiles] but once they get to know who's the boss, they won't give you no more "human rights"
 bullshit. Tell you what, when I meet demands from my top priority customers then you can check out the rest of my
 stock. That's the best I can do given the circumstances.}
{113}{}{Alright then.}
#
{114}{}{What the hell do you want this time?}
#about your "organization" second time...
{115}{}{Did you put on the fucking ear plugs last time we spoke? [Grunts.] Uh... nevermind. I sell hard working
 servants, well trained and obedient. For a fair price you get only high quality, nothing less.}
{116}{}{I heard you, let me ask you something else.}
#
{117}{}{I'm in a hurry, so don't bother me with your thinking. Say what you want!}
#
{118}{}{I'd like to make some money, maybe work for you?}
#
{119}{}{"I'd like to make some money", do you know how pathetic that sounds!? And who the fuck are you to want
 something from me? In fact, I'm not selling anything to you "wanna be popular" bone head and I don't require guards,
 so get lost scumbag!}
{120}{}{Right, let me ask you something else.}
{121}{}{I'm out of this awful place.}
#added 24.09.06 dude's town reputation is >= accepted...
{122}{}{So you want to join!? Never thought someone with your reputation would like to join us from the other side
 of the law. If you still think you are good enough, let me ask you something first. Do you really think I'm just going to
 let anyone stick his nose into our business!? }
{123}{}{Well... I guess not, but I'd like to prove myself.}
{124}{}{Forget it. I'm out of here.}
#prove...
{125}{}{You're damn right! Until you prove yourself to be trust worthy, you'll get your hands dirty, no excuses! One
 more thing, if you mess up something or I hear you talking shit to anyone else I will kill you, got it?! Alright now, let's
 get started. You need to head south to a small place called Silting...}
{126}{}{Go on...}
#
{127}{}{My sources told me they run some kind of trading business, but it's all a great fucking cover up. During the
 night they shift large amounts of weapon boxes in and out of the heavily guarded cave entrance. Now, one must be
 very stupid not to figure this is where they keep all those goods. So I want to know what else they have inside that
 fortress, and more important, is it for sale. Because that's our damn way in! If they won't let you see the stock then
 fucking do whatever you can and find out anything about their doings. Just don't get yourself into trouble or you'll be
 sorry! Go now.}
{128}{}{[Leave.]}
#back, less than three days...
{129}{}{About that job...}
#
{130}{}{What are you doing here?! I don't want to see your face in this room again without any information. You got
 it, stupid fuck!?}
{131}{}{Sorry.}
{132}{}{I've had enough of you. Time to die, slaver scum!}
#
{133}{}{What is it? Speak!}
{135}{}{Still working on it.}
#got Slavers' Account Book...
{136}{}{I have the information you need, this account book. It's all here...}
#account book...
{137}{}{This is very good, you earned yourself a little bonus. So I'll give you $2500 instead of $2450... That's what I
 call a little bonus! Hahaha! Now get lost!}
{138}{}{Right.}
{139}{}{I demand a raise right now!}
#added 22.01.2007 reputation accepted and Mr.Basil from philton busted...
{140}{}{So you want to join us!? Why would I let some rat-head who despises slavery join us? Words about your
 involvement in that Valley-something traveled fast. On the other hand... that bastard was our competition, so you
 actually did us a favor.}
{141}{}{So that's a good thing, right?}
{142}{}{I can get things done, ask anyone.}
#with 137, got Slavers' Transactions 23.08.2023
{143}{}{I have their transactions list, here...}
