#{261}{}{Thank you for your time. But please remember: I'm not asking you to do anything illegal, but I don't care how you deal with the guy. In any case, I will deny my involvement in any misconduct, and the Sheriff trusts me much more than he trusts you.}
{261}{}{谢谢你抽出时间。但请记住：我不是要你做任何违法的事，但我不在乎你怎么处理这个家伙。无论如何，我会否认我参与了任何不当行为，警长对我的信任远远超过对你的信任。 -- Thank you for your time.

#{270}{}{You think it's a "small retail outlet". But think about it, how can a random flashman have so many goods to sell? I don't know where he gets his Nuka-Cola, but it certainly doesn't come from us. Nobody knows how he got so many bottles for his stock. He may even have a full storage somewhere. What's worse is that his goods also cost less. Such competition may negatively affect the factory's reputation in the future.}
{270}{}{你认为这是个“小零售店”。但想想看，一个随机抽认的人怎么会有这么多商品要卖呢？我不知道他从哪儿弄来的努卡可乐，但肯定不是我们的。没人知道他怎么会有这么多瓶存货。他甚至可能有一个完整的存储在某处。更糟糕的是，他的商品也便宜。这种竞争可能会对工厂未来的声誉产生负面影响。 -- You think it's a "small retail outlet".

#{283}{}{[He frowns, showing his discontent with this conversation.] Firstly, the pre-war drink has been kept in closed bottles for more than 70 years. In that time, like wine, it has changed its properties, gaining new ones. The Nuka-Cola that you can find in pre-war stocks is already quite different than it once was. And secondly... I don't like to talk about it, but we don't know how the drink was made in the past. We managed to attain a more-or-less similar tasting qualities, thanks to the information from the labels and our own laboratory research. Of course, it's not a complete match. That's why our Nuka-Cola is somewhat different from the pre-war one, but people still like it.}
{283}{}{[他皱着眉头，表示他对这次谈话的不满]首先，战前的饮料已经被关在瓶子里70多年了。在那个时代，它和葡萄酒一样，改变了它的特性，获得了新的特性。你可以在战前的库存中找到的努卡可乐已经和以前大不相同了。其次。。。我不想谈这个，但我们不知道这饮料过去是怎么做的。多亏了标签上的信息和我们自己的实验室研究，我们设法获得了或多或少相似的品尝品质。当然，这不完全匹配。这就是为什么我们的努卡可乐与战前的有所不同，但人们仍然喜欢它。 -- [He frowns, showing his discontent with this conversation.] Firstly, the pre-war drink has been kept in closed bottles for more than 70 years.
