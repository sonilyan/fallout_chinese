### {100}{}{You see a settler.}

### {101}{}{Here is a local resident of a rather repulsive appearance. It seems that local life was bleak for him.}

### {200}{}{What do you want?}

### {201}{}{I just want to know how life is in this small town.}
{201}{}{我只想知道这个小镇的生活怎么样。}
### {202}{}{Life is bad. Just like everywhere else nowadays. But we have plenty of clean water. It's already worth it to choose Casa Grande for your stay.}
{202}{}{生活很糟糕。就像现在其他地方一样。但是我们有充足的清洁水。选择格兰德之家住宿已经很值得了。}
### {203}{}{Then why are the streets so deserted here?}
{203}{}{那为什么这里的街道如此冷清呢？}
### {204}{}{I'll tell you what, stranger. Casa Grande has a complicated history. And what we have learned from this story is that it is better not to ask questions about the past. Do you understand me? That's great.}
{204}{}{我告诉你吧，陌生人。格兰德之家有着复杂的历史。我们从这个故事中学到的是，最好不要问关于过去的问题。你明白我的意思吗？太好了。}
### {205}{}{Sounds like you have something to regret.}

### {206}{}{Everyone in this city has had losses. And we are no exception. We lost our old house and our son. Therefore, no one here is going to reveal their soul to the first person they meet.}
{206}{}{这个城市的每个人都遭受了损失。我们也不例外。我们失去了老房子和儿子。因此，这里没有人会向他们遇到的第一个人透露他们的灵魂。}

### {211}{}{Forget it, I'm just passing by.}

### {220}{}{I'm looking for relatives of a boy named Cody.}
{220}{}{我在找一个叫科迪的男孩的亲戚。}
### {221}{}{Cody? That was our son's name... I haven't heard from him for several years- since the tinsmiths took him away.}
{221}{}{科迪？那是我们儿子的名字。。。自从铁匠把他带走后，我已经好几年没有他的消息了。}
### {222}{}{Apparently we're talking about the same person.}
{222}{}{显然，我们谈论的是同一个人。}
### {223}{}{So he's alive? It's a miracle, we didn't even hope... That is, I want to say that there are terrible rumors about tinsmiths. How is he feeling?}
{223}{}{所以他还活着？这是一个奇迹，我们甚至没有希望。。。也就是说，我想说，有关于锡匠的可怕谣言。他感觉怎么样？}
### {224}{}{He is brainwashed and forced to work, but outwardly he looks fine.}
{224}{}{他被洗脑，被迫工作，但从表面上看他很好。}
### {225}{}{Yes, of course. He's already a different person... He was brought up as a tinsmith, deals with his hardware and probably doesn't even remember about us. It will be better if it stays that way. I just hope he doesn't hold a grudge against us.}
{225}{}{是的，当然。他已经是另一个人了。。。他从小就是一个打铁匠，处理他的硬件，可能甚至不记得我们了。如果保持这种状态会更好。我只是希望他不要对我们怀恨在心。}
### {226}{}{Hmm. I think I should clarify this point with him. Goodbye.}
{226}{}{嗯。我想我应该向他澄清这一点。再见}

### {230}{}{I have evidence that Cody wasn't just taken away. You *sold* it.}
{230}{}{我有证据表明科迪不是刚刚被带走的。你把它卖了。}
### {231}{}{Shut up! Who are you to meddle in our affairs?}
{231}{}{闭嘴！你是谁来干涉我们的事？}
### {232}{}{Wait a minute...}
{232}{}{等一下。。。}
### {233}{}{We were on the verge! The settlement was bent without water, we *had* to give everything to fix the water pump. Including our children. And now you come after so many years and stir up the past. You'd better leave us. Just leave us alone.}
{233}{}{我们就在边缘！定居点被水淹没了，我们不得不竭尽全力修理水泵。包括我们的孩子。现在你在这么多年后来到这里，挑起了过去。你最好离开我们，别管我们。}
### {234}{}{You're right there - it's not for me to judge you. Goodbye.}
{234}{}{你就在那里――我不能评判你。再见}
### {235}{}{I hope that Cody has fallen into good hands and will live a better life than we do.}
{235}{}{我希望科迪已经落入好人之手，并将过上比我们更好的生活。}
