{100}{}{This is private property. Do you have any business with me?}
#
{101}{}{What is this place?}
{102}{}{Sorry, I'll be going now.}
#1
{103}{}{This is "None of your business" place. So tell me, why are you really here?}
#
{104}{}{I'm new in town, I thought you have something for sale here.}
{105}{}{I'm sorry, didn't mean to disturb you.}
#2
{106}{}{Tell you what stranger, this might be your lucky day but I can't just show my stuff to anyone. My reputation
 speaks for itself. Usually, respect comes with business. Here, it goes the other way round.}
#
{107}{}{Maybe I could do something to earn your respect?}
{108}{}{How about I blow your fucking head off and earn some respect from your competition?}
#3
{109}{}{Now we're talking the same language. Listen, I borrowed money to a guy, Jim's his name. Didn't hear a
 word from that son of a bitch for almost two weeks. Use whatever persuasive skills you have to get my money back.
 Otherwise I'll send someone to beat the shit out of him... And we don't want that, do we?}
#
{110}{}{Hell no, where can I find this Jim?}
#4
{111}{}{Last time I saw his ugly face... was when he promised me my money back. Other than that, use your
 imagination, where would you go with some cash to spend? Don't tell me the fucking zoo!}
#
{112}{}{Easy there, I'll talk to him.}
#5
{113}{}{Well, did you bring my money?}
#
{114}{}{Yep, I got it right here.}
{115}{}{No, he spent it all on gambling.}
#yep
{116}{}{Keep up the good work, I won't forget this. There is actually one more thing I need you to do.}
#
{117}{}{Just say it.}
{118}{}{Sorry, not interested.}
#not interested, back
{119}{}{Wanna do that job?}
#
{120}{}{Alright.}
{121}{}{Later.}
#just say it, all right
{122}{}{Where to begin... My main activities include, before all, trading in goods and our network works best when
 everyone is doing their job. But I have a problem that threatens to slow down my business. One of my associates was
 arrested recently on false accusations of carrying illegal substances. I want his sorry ass out of jail as soon as possible.
 I don't care what it takes. Do this and you'll get your five minutes.}
#
{123}{}{I'm on it.}
{124}{}{(This doesn't feel right.) I'm sorry but I can't do this.}
#
{125}{}{What, give up so easily? I thought you had it in you... (sighs). Guess I was wrong. Now I have to find another
 dumb ass to do your job. [Points to the open manhole.] Get in there, don't make me drag you!}
#
{126}{}{Easy, I'm going.}
{127}{}{I'm not going anywhere you fucking pervert!}
#to 115 :don't have the money
{128}{}{So, what are you doing here? Get out of my sight!}
#
{129}{}{Whoa, easy there, I'm going.}
{130}{}{I've changed my mind, the deal is off. I'm out of here...}
#again return,
{131}{}{You again. What do you want?}
#
{132}{}{I didn't talk to him yet.}
#
{133}{}{Go get my man out of jail, and then we'll talk.}
#
{134}{}{Sure thing.}
#
{135}{}{Well done! Dreak is out of that shit hole. Since we had a deal and you kept your word, looks like we are
 going to do some business after all. Let me show you my stuff.}
#
{136}{}{Sure.}
#
{137}{}{Hello there, want to see my goods?}
#
{138}{}{Sure thing, Mr. Basil.}
{139}{}{Maybe later.}
#
{140}{}{See you again.}
#
{141}{}{Sure thing, Mr. Basil.}
#110+
{142}{}{Hey, don't drag me into your schemes. If you want to hurt someone, do it yourself old man!}
#112+
{143}{}{That's way too boring, grandpa... I rather buy me some hardware and waste all you pricks instead!}
#130+
{144}{}{I'm sick of you yelling at me all the time... Shut up already!}
#additional line 113, 114,rip Jim...
{145}{}{Jim is... or how should I put this, was... more than willing to cooperate. Poor guy raised the stakes, went
 all in and chance took it all away. What a waste.}
{146}{}{Well, I see someone's getting better (smirks). There is actually one more thing I need you to do.}
#
{147}{}{You took care of Jim and his debts. Your resourcefulness is unmatched. You earn 200 exp. points.}
{148}{}{You helped Jim pay his debts. You earn 400 exp. points.}
{149}{}{You freed Mr. Basil's associate. You earn 500 exp. points.}
{150}{}{While distracted, someone knocks you on the back of the head, and all goes black.}
