#Description
{101}{}{It's making noises... means it's working.}
#Description with science 50+ before purchase
{102}{}{You can tell one thing by looking at it... it's not working well.}
#science used IN 5+
{103}{}{You can clearly distinguish three separate units: main power, control and processing.}
#science used dummy
{104}{}{Despite all your brain power, you fail to comprehend anything.}
#science 50+ used
{105}{}{You spent some time examining the machine. You notice what appears to be a malfunctioning module in the control unit. To put it short, it looks damaged and needs to be replaced.}
#science below 50 used
{106}{}{Your skills are too low to help you with this one.}
#science after purchase
{107}{}{It still needs the replacement module... you vaguely remember purchasing one.}
#Type B installed repair 50+ 
{108}{}{You had no difficulties replacing the module. Now, you only have to wait, those first minutes are always the
 most critical...}
#Type A installed repair 50+ 
{109}{}{You had no difficulties replacing the module. And now, the moment of truth...}
#Two modules
{110}{}{You have two modules. And there's only space for one. You will have to choose.}
#Failed install
{111}{}{Your repair skills are not good enough to perform such a delicate task.}
#Type B installed
{112}{}{You notice that the air pressure indicator shows a slightly higher value than a few seconds ago.}
{113}{}{Air pressure is holding...}
{114}{}{Huh... just for a second...} #float
{115}{}{You notice a strange fluid dripping on the ground from a nearby valve.}
{116}{}{Hm... this is new... smells like industrial oil...} #float
{117}{}{You start to feel some vibrations... not the good ones though.}
{118}{}{Wow! I can totally feel that...} #float
{119}{}{The machine is getting louder by the second... something seems very wrong here!}
{120}{}{Oh my god! Where's the OFF switch...} #float
{121}{}{With no time for you to react... all hell breaks loose.}
{122}{}{...you can still get away, maybe nobody saw that...}
#Type A installed
{123}{}{Air pressure is normal...}
{124}{}{Oil pressure stays within normal range...}
{125}{}{It purrs like a kitten...} #float
{126}{}{The ore processing machine runs much smoother now. You earn 1500 exp. points.}
#hint, old module destroyed
{127}{}{I might be able to find another module in Philton somewhere...}
