{104}{}{Never mind that. Have you seen any prisoners lately?}
{105}{}{Who is here?}
#prisoners
{106}{}{[He flinches.] Prisoners? Here? [He suddenly smiles.] We're all prisoners, right? Prisoners of this world,
 prisoners of the five, no, it's four riders of the apocopopo... lop, what's it called; The end of the world! It's coming, it's
 coming! The four riders are coming. Dingo, Moon and, eh, Bongo and Terry. They will purge this wasteland for its
 sins!} #first name is the actual name of an escaped convict
{107}{}{Is that so.}
{108}{}{Does your guardian know you're out and about?}
#guardian
{109}{}{The Lord cannot be found unless he wants to. [Giggles.] Run, little puppet, run!}

#after 105
{112}{}{The four horseman, the prophecy of old, sent to do the lord's will. They came to punish the evil doers and end
 the world for its sins. It's the Apocolops! No, the aproco-pops, the apocolopopopo..., the apoco-hopsy-lopsy..., the
 lopsy-popsy..., [with much effort] the ardropo-hoppo-loppo, the a..., the... [he trails off...]}

{114}{}{Go on.}
#name
{115}{}{Yes, eh, Scooby, Dobby, Maan and, eh, Jeff.} #last two are the actual names of escaped convicts
{116}{}{I thought it was war, death, famine and pestilence? Or have they already been here? And your lot of Tom,
 Dick and Harry are the squad to mop up the cockroaches and radiation?}

{118}{}{Never mind.}
#after 107, 114
{119}{}{They know everything, they see everything. [Whispers.] Trust me, they are organized, their little spies are
 everywhere, miners, farmers, gold diggers, squirrels... everyone. And they are gathering, watching and waiting, for the
 time to mount their beasts and ride out to purge the wasteland.}
{120}{}{Whatever put that into your head?}
{121}{}{Gee, how do you even find the courage to stand out here without your tin-foil hat on.}
#tin foil
{122}{}{[He reaches up to his head, feeling around in confusion.]}
{123}{}{Got you.}
#after 120
{124}{}{I've seen them walking into town late at night. The four horseman. They stayed at a tent south of here, left a
 message and moved out again. Now their couriers are in all corners of the world, spreading the lord's will to
 purge the wasteland.}
{125}{}{I'm afraid to ask, but do go on.}
{126}{}{Seriously now, *when* and *where* did this happen?}
{127}{}{They seem to have purged your brain already.}
#do go on, list of places
{128}{}{There is a dark place with vermin inside.} #Miners Town
{129}{}{...}
{130}{}{Oh, shut it.}
#
{131}{}{There's a place where the corn quietly grows but it has no peace.} #Farmers Town

{139}{}{What are those places?}
{140}{}{That was very flowery. I guess I should have known I was talking to a fucking poet. What's next, are you
 going to cut off your ear in a romantic gesture? I have a knife if you need it.   } #spaces needed to force line-break

{143}{}{They are places? I don't know any places. [Screws up his eyes.]}
{144}{}{Then where did you hear them?}

{145}{}{When did what happen? I don't know what happened. [Screws up his eyes.]}
{146}{}{I give up...}
{147}{}{Then where did you hear it?}
#after 144, 147
{148}{}{Heard what?}
{149}{}{Noises. Do you hear noises?} #with IN 10
{150}{}{Places. Do you know any places?}
#Noises
{151}{}{I heard them. All the miners & farmers, all the anguished souls, shrieking out in terror and then suddenly
 farting very, very quietly into the night. There will be a reckoning, when the time comes. The oppressed masses are
 waiting. Waiting for the call to rise. Eternally alert and watchful! Just in case they send a vengeful spirit. We are well
 prepared and it should give us plenty of time to react, sir. Ring the bell three times! What do you mean Flash Gordon's
 approaching?! Open fire. All weapons! We removed the symptom, but not the cause! Hail to the King! Hail! Hail!
 Three times, they double-crossed us, they're coming by land and sea... Hark, and Jesus on a rubber duck! Unwittingly,
 he trained a dolphin to kill the president.}
{152}{}{It's been fun, but I really need to go now. Bye.}
{153}{}{Got any more?}

{154}{}{[Breathes in.] There is NOTHING more wretched under the sun than you Gods! You feed yourself poorly
 with sacrifices and incense. And would STARVE, if beggars and children wouldn't be hopeful fools. Here am I.
 Creating beings after my image. A race that is equal to me. To laugh. To cry. And to rejoice. And NOT to honor you.
 AS I DO! [coughs...] My heart stood still his name was BILL! The tragedy of human existence is not to be the master
 of its own creation. Nice try, she said. But no more buttered scones for me, I'm off playing the grand piano. Hundred
 little notes of never to be finished work, scattered all over the place, like his failing mind. He couldn't sit on a chair,
 you know, but neither could his eldest son, now picture that at the dinner table, on the one end the father keeps falling
 off and on the other his eldest son.}
{155}{}{Fascinating. Do go on.}
#
{156}{}{Flash, Flash I love you, but we only have fourteen hours the save the universe! [checks watch.] It's the people
 who don't pay their TV-license against the Nazis! Harold was a clever sheep. We were talking about mutual assured
 destruction and emotional responsibility. I couldn't remember my name so I called myself Bob. It's weird being a Bob
 but I get used to it. Guess, I have, too. Oh, come on darling, be realistic demand the impossible. Phoebus! A Goat?
 Phoebus! Emotions: An agitation or disturbance of the mind. [Sings.] I've seen blue skies, through the tears, and I
 realize, I'm going home. [Stops.] Bang! Bang! You're dead... but... That is not dead what endless rests, 'till time itself
 finds endless death. Nork! She rules the atomic wasteland! O, Soeur Marie-Therese des Batignolles...}

 his life that night. Torille! Torille! Tavataan. And whoopsy-daisy. It's quite an irregular place to be, but never fear
 you're save with me - well, maybe. But if reality is but a dream, and this world a figment of our imagination, we should
 be quite safe. So for Helen's Back sake stop THINKING about it. I've been fighting gravity since I was two. Show me
 the money! ARSE. That would be an ecumenical matter! We are all guilty of judgment and only seeing what we want
 to see. Society needs to be protected - a decision had to be made. They didn't like me! They never liked me! And
 crawling on the planet's face, some insects called the human race. Lost in time, space and meaning. Still, you've got to
 laugh, haven't you. Hello, Dolly it's 5.75 and the freeway looks fine.}
