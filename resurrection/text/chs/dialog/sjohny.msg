{700}{}{你得和老板谈谈这件事。他叫德米特里，你可以在门厅找到他。}
#{701}{}{Fine, I'll go do that.}
{701}{}{好吧，我去做。}
#{702}{}{Why do I have to speak to him in particular?}
{702}{}{为什么我要特别跟他说话？}
#{750}{}{Oh, that must be you. The boss said he's just hired somebody.}
{750}{}{哦，那一定是你。老板说他刚雇了个人。}
#{751}{}{But he sent me to see Keri.}
{751}{}{但他派我去见克里。}
#{752}{}{So, what job do you have for me?}
{752}{}{那么，你给我做什么工作？}
#{800}{}{Uh... Yes. He does that, sometimes. But trust me, I'm the one you should talk to regarding work.}

{851}{}{[离开]}
#{900}{}{This company belongs to him, I only work here. And Demetre wants to hire everyone personally. I'm sorry, but until the time he says he takes you, there's nothing I can do for you.}
{900}{}{这家公司属于他，我只在这里工作。德米特里想亲自雇佣所有人。对不起，在他说要带你去之前，我帮不了你。}
#{901}{}{OK.}
{901}{}{好 啊。}
#{950}{}{We hire standard caravan guards. And I have some extra work from the boss specially for you, if you're interested.}

#{1055}{}{I'll come back another time.}
{1055}{}{我改天再来。}
#{1100}{}{Yep, that's it, nice name. So the boss wants you to negotiate an exchange-of-goods deal. Our caravan would travel to them every month, the business would take place. Business profitable for us as well as for them. The thing is, we want to be the first to have a deal with them. There won't be space for other caravans in a place that small, so the first company will be the last one. Other companies probably won't be interested, anyway, it's too far away. You better hurry, just to make sure.}
{1100}{}{是的，就是这样，好名字。所以老板要你谈一笔换货交易。我们的大篷车每个月都会去他们那里，生意就这样开始了。生意对我们和他们都有利。问题是，我们想第一个和他们达成协议。在这么小的地方不会有其他商队的空间，所以第一个公司将是最后一个。其他公司可能不会感兴趣，反正太远了。你最好快点，确定一下。}

{1202}{}{这还不够，我还想要更多！}

{1252}{}{见鬼去吧。}
#{1300}{}{Our caravans leave on the 3rd and 17th of every month. Come at any such time and you'll be able to join as a guard. Like the others, we travel to Albuquerque and Corath. But we offer the best wage ?? 600 caps for a single ride.}
{1300}{}{我们的商队每个月3号和17号出发。任何时候来，你都可以当警卫。像其他人一样，我们去了阿尔伯克基和科拉斯。但是我们提供最好的工资，一次600欧元。}

#{1306}{}{I'll come back another time.}
{1306}{}{我改天再来。}
#{1350}{}{Our company's caravans always take the shortest route. Other companies avoid certain places because they're... Ahem... Riskier.}
{1350}{}{我们公司的商队总是走最短的路线。其他公司避开某些地方，因为他们。。。啊哼。。。风险更大。}
#{1351}{}{In that case, I'll return when the caravans are ready.}
{1351}{}{那样的话，等商队准备好了我再回来。}
#{1352}{}{I'm not interested in this.}
{1352}{}{我对此不感兴趣。}
#{1353}{}{When did you say that the caravans leave?}
{1353}{}{你说商队什么时候离开的？}
#{1354}{}{So by joining your caravan I'll be risking my neck a lot. Do I get it right?}
{1354}{}{所以加入你的车队我会冒很大的风险。我明白了吗？}
#{1400}{}{Ahem... I've never been to any of them. You'll have to ask someone else or just go there yourself.}
{1400}{}{啊哼。。。我从来没有去过他们中的任何一个。你得问问别人或者自己去。}
#{1401}{}{In that case, I'll return when the caravans are ready.}

#{1452}{}{I'm not interested in this.}
{1452}{}{我对此不感兴趣。}
#{1453}{}{When did you say that the caravans leave?}
{1453}{}{你说商队什么时候离开的？}
#{1454}{}{On the average, how many people make it back?}
{1454}{}{平均来说，有多少人回来了？}
#{1500}{}{About 60 percent on the average. It's true some of them only take the journey there, but there's usually someone who joins the caravan on its way back. Look, if it wasn't dangerous, it wouldn't pay that well. It's up to you and whether you feel up to it or not.}
{1500}{}{平均约60%。的确，他们中的一些人只是去那里旅行，但通常有人会在回来的路上加入商队。听着，如果不危险的话，就不会有那么好的回报。这取决于你自己，也取决于你是否能胜任。}
#{1501}{}{I think I can handle myself. I guess I'll return when the caravans are ready.}
{1501}{}{我想我能应付自己。我想等商队准备好了我就回来。}
#{1502}{}{I don't think I'm up to this.}
{1502}{}{我想我做不到。}
#{1503}{}{When did you say that the caravans leave?}
{1503}{}{你说商队什么时候离开的？}
#{1504}{}{If you say it's such great money, why don't you go on a journey yourself, too?}
{1504}{}{如果你说这是一大笔钱，你为什么不自己去旅行呢？}
#{1550}{}{I... Well, that's not for me. I've got my own job. It pays well and it's not that dangerous. Even though... Bah... It can get pretty dangerous here as well.}
{1550}{}{一、 。。。好吧，那不是给我的。我有自己的工作。报酬很高，也没那么危险。尽管。。。呸。。。这里也会很危险。}
#{1551}{}{You're telling me you never wanted to get out of town?}
{1551}{}{你是说你从没想过要出城？}
#{1552}{}{How dangerous does it get here?}
{1552}{}{这里有多危险？}
#{1554}{}{OK, fine, tell me again about the caravans instead.}
{1554}{}{好吧，再告诉我一次关于商队的事。}
#{1600}{}{No. You're not the first one trying to convince me to go somehwere but I'm not interested in dying out there in the wastes.}
{1600}{}{不，你不是第一个试图说服我去某个地方的人，但我对死在荒野里不感兴趣。}
#{1601}{}{Me neither. I'm not that easy to kill!}
{1601}{}{我也是。我没那么容易被杀！}
#{1602}{}{As you think.}
{1602}{}{如你所想。}
#{1603}{}{OK, fine, tell me again about the caravans instead.}
{1603}{}{好吧，再告诉我一次关于商队的事。}
#{1650}{}{In that case, I wish you good luck. You're going to need it.}
{1650}{}{那样的话，祝你好运。你会需要的。}
#{1651}{}{Fortune helps those who help themselves. See you.}
{1651}{}{命运帮助自助者。再见。}
#{1700}{}{You know, Demetre... Oh, forget that. He's my boss and I don't want to say anything some people might understand incorrectly.}
{1700}{}{你知道吗，德米特里。。。哦，算了吧。他是我的老板，我不想说任何别人可能理解不正确的话。}
#{1701}{}{But you could tell me at least.}
{1701}{}{但你至少可以告诉我。}
#{1702}{}{Don't worry, I won't tell anybody anything.}
{1702}{}{别担心，我什么都不会告诉任何人。}
#{1703}{}{OK, keep it to yourself.}
{1703}{}{好吧，你自己留着吧。}
#{1750}{}{I've already said I won't. Let's go back to the caravans.}
{1750}{}{我已经说过我不会了。我们回到大篷车上去吧。}
#{1751}{}{OK.}
{1751}{}{好 啊。}
#{1800}{}{Okay, then. You know, Demetre's been playing with all kinds of explosives recently. You never know what might explode here. A shelf exploded here once, fortunately, nothing happened to me, but it was close.}
{1800}{}{好吧，那么。你知道，德米特里最近一直在玩各种炸药。你永远不知道这里会发生什么爆炸。一个架子在这里爆炸了一次，幸运的是，我什么也没发生，但它离我很近。}
#{1801}{}{To be honest, you don't look like someone who'll manage to work here for long.}
{1801}{}{老实说，你看起来不像一个能在这里工作很长时间的人。}
#{1802}{}{Is that all? Know what, tell me about the caravans instead.}
{1802}{}{就这些吗？告诉我关于商队的事。}
#{1850}{}{Well, ahem. I already wanted to leave this place a couple of times, but you can't find another job that pays this well without having somebody shoot at you. And... Ahem... Have you seen Keri? Demetre's daughter. She's good-looking, isn't she?}
{1850}{}{嗯，嗯哼。我已经想离开这个地方好几次了，但是如果没有人向你开枪，你就找不到另一份薪水这么高的工作。还有。。。啊哼。。。你见过克里吗？德米特里的女儿。她很漂亮，不是吗？}
#{1851}{}{Yeah, Keri's hot! I'd do her right now if I could!}
{1851}{}{是啊，克里很性感！如果可以的话，我现在就杀了她！}
#{1852}{}{So you like Keri, eh?}
{1852}{}{所以你喜欢克里，嗯？}
#{1853}{}{I see. Tell me about the caravans instead.}
{1853}{}{我懂了。告诉我关于商队的事。}
#{1854}{}{You won't be seeing Keri around here much anymore. She's decided to join me on my journeys, as you might have noticed.}
{1854}{}{你在这附近再也见不到克里了。她决定和我一起旅行，你可能已经注意到了。}
#{1900}{}{Well, just... Just try telling her that and she'll kick your ass!}
{1900}{}{好吧，只是。。。试着告诉她，她会揍你的！}
#{1901}{}{We'll see.}
{1901}{}{我们拭目以待。}
#{1902}{}{OK, fine, I'm sorry. Tell me again about the caravans instead.}
{1902}{}{好吧，很抱歉。再说一遍关于商队的事。}
#{1950}{}{The thing is she, I... That's none of your business, let's get back to work.}
{1950}{}{问题是她，我。。。那不关你的事，我们回去工作吧。}
#{1951}{}{OK.}
{1951}{}{好 啊。}
#{2000}{}{But! That... That. Oh, well, what can I do?}
{2000}{}{但是！那个。。。那个。哦，好吧，我能做什么？}
#{2001}{}{Don't worry, I'll look after her.}
{2001}{}{别担心，我会照顾她的。}
#{2002}{}{You have any problem with that?}
{2002}{}{你有什么问题吗？}
#{2050}{}{I believe Keri can take care of herself on her own. Let's get back to work instead.}
{2050}{}{我相信克里能自己照顾自己。让我们回去工作吧。}

#{2850}{}{Tadeus belonged to the Children of the Cathedral. It was mainly them who brought people to the Master so they could be changed into supermutants. And after the Master was killed, supermutants turned into a reckless murdering band drifting through the wasteland. One big group reduced Hub to rubble. The Crimson Caravan used to have their HQ there and they were doing very well. Then the supermutants destroyed everything and killed most of the people in the process. Demetre and Keri managed to escape, but they had to build everything they have here from scratch. Demetre wants revenge. I gotta say that even though I don't like killing, I can understand that.}
{2850}{}{塔德乌斯属于大教堂的孩子们。主要是他们把人带到主人面前，让他们变成超级变种人。主人被杀后，超级变形金刚变成了一个鲁莽的杀人团伙，在荒地里游荡。一大群人把中心夷为平地。深红色大篷车曾经有他们的总部在那里，他们做得很好。然后超级变种人摧毁了一切，并在这个过程中杀死了大部分人。德米特里和克里设法逃走了，但他们必须从头开始建造这里的一切。德米特里想要复仇。我得说，即使我不喜欢杀人，我也能理解。}

{2900}{}{好吧，事情结束后再来。还有一件事。德米特里想让塔迪斯知道是谁在他死前派你来的。这是关于复仇的，他一定知道。}
#{2901}{}{OK.}
{2901}{}{好 啊。}
#{2950}{}{OK, no one's forcing you. I just want to remind you we never had this conversation. There's no point talking about it to anyone. No one would believe you, anyway, it's your word against mine.}
{2950}{}{好吧，没人强迫你。我只想提醒你，我们从来没谈过这个。跟任何人谈都没有意义。没人会相信你，不管怎样，这是你对我说的话。}
