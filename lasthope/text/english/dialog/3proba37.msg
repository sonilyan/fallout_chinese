{100}{}{I'm busy now.}
{101}{}{Can't talk right now.}
{102}{}{I don't remember you.}
{103}{}{Nice to meet you, there's the door.}
{104}{}{Are you the pizza guy?}
{105}{}{Stockman's doesn't need loiters in here.}
#
{106}{}{Do you know how busy I am? What is it that you want?}
{107}{}{I spoke to one of the power plant owners, Leonard from Duntown. He needs your help to guard his ore
 shipments.}
{108}{}{I'll come back later then.}
#
{109}{}{What do you want? Are you going to stand there all day?}
#
{110}{}{I wish I could be more optimistic about this but that ain't gonna happen while certain things are left in their
 present state.}
{111}{}{What are you saying?}
{112}{}{So you don't want to help?}
#
{113}{}{We could help, but that could leave us exposed to other "factors" who will gladly take advantage of the
 situation and try to benefit from it.}
{114}{}{And those "factors" are...}
#
{115}{}{Whenever there was any major business going on, somebody used the situation and left us empty-handed. We
 were robbed several times in the past few weeks. It goes to the point where the losses could pose a serious threat to our
 future business. I can't just stand still and watch my hard work go to waste!}
{116}{}{So, what is happening?}
#
{117}{}{Like I said, stuff from our stock went missing, too often to say it was misplaced or left off the books by
 mistake. I suspected we had an inside man doing this, even fired several people from the staff. That proved wrong soon
 after. There's somebody else from the outside who tracks our position and sneaks in when we least suspect it, there's no
 other explanation.}
{118}{}{How can someone just sneak in while your men are at the front door?}
#
{119}{}{That's exactly what I don't understand. We have several guards working in shifts, for this door only. I've
 checked everything... [sighs] and couldn't find anything out of the ordinary, I have no more ideas whatsoever. That's
 why we need someone with a different approach to this problem...}
{120}{}{Can I help you somehow?}
{121}{}{I'm sorry to hear that. I'll leave you to your business then.}
#
{122}{}{Of course. This is serious and I could use all available resources. I'll make sure you get your money but only
 after you bring me something useful. Ask around, someone must have seen or heard something. You'll have access to
 our storage room.}
{123}{}{Sure thing.}
# come again... job not taken
{124}{}{I want to help about that "missing stock" problem you have.}
{125}{}{Sorry, my mistake. I'll be on my way.}
#job taken...
{126}{}{I know you don't have anything important to say so don't come back until you do. And don't bother me in the
 meantime, I have too much work already.}
{127}{}{Whatever you say.}
#
{128}{}{I see you have been working a lot. How is your investigation going, any leads?}
{129}{}{There's a hidden passage in your safe room, beneath the table. It leads down below and it's possible those
 thieves came in that way.}
{130}{}{Nothing yet.}
#
{131}{}{Hidden passage you say... where does it lead to? Did you actually see anyone?}
{132}{}{No, I didn't.}
{133}{}{Unfortunately, the cover was sealed tight from the other side so I couldn't open it.}
#
{134}{}{Very interesting... we'll try to force it open. If not, rig it with some booby-traps and let it be. If someone is
 hiding down there, he will have to come out eventually, soon I hope. I'm just counting on he wasn't smart enough to dig
 out an alternative entry route. Guess we'll find that out too. Here [gives you some cash], $500 bucks for you. You really
 helped me so far. Your skills might come in handy in the future.}
{135}{}{Thanks, see you later.}
#man Leonard, line 107, after help is done...
{136}{}{All right, since you helped us... I'm thinking about a personal meeting, you tell him that. I guess we're done
 here, back to work then. Excuse me now.}
{137}{}{That should be enough.}
#
{138}{}{Yes, you helped... But take it easy.}
{139}{}{I'm busy now.}
{140}{}{I still got work to do and I'm busy.}
{141}{}{Don't have time to talk, maybe later.}
#
{142}{}{Nice to see you again, say what you want and be quick about it!}
{143}{}{I mentioned Leonard from Duntown, my employer. He needs help guarding his ore shipments.}
{144}{}{I'll come later then.}
#added later...after line 106
{145}{}{Who are you?}
#
{146}{}{I'm Matt. Along with my associates we represent "Stockman's Association".}
{147}{}{What do you do here?}
{148}{}{Thanks. Let me ask you something else.}
#do here...
{149}{}{We are doing mostly trading business. Usual stuff, like selling ore and various stock keeping. Now, is there
 something else because I'm very busy here?}
{150}{}{Thanks for your time. Just one more question please.}
