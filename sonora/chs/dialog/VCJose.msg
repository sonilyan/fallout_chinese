#The first dialog
### {200}{}{Oh, dear amigo, how glad I am that at least the cursed fate has left you with us! Ay-ay-ay, the damned raiders. You're lucky you weren't around.}
{200}{}{哦，亲爱的朋友，我多么高兴，至少被诅咒的命运把你留在了我们身边！唉，该死的袭击者。你很幸运你不在身边。}
### {201}{}{Uncle Jose, tell me about the raid.}
{201}{}{何塞叔叔，告诉我突袭的事。}
### {202}{}{Eh, these devils swooped in a crowd when no one was waiting. Someone was immediately tied up, and someone managed to hide at home. Your padre and the men took refuge in the town hall. They were stormed out of there. The shootout was not a joke. The dead are lying like that, there is no one to bury them.}
{202}{}{哎，这些鬼子趁着没人等的时候，就冲了过来。有人立即被绑起来，有人设法躲在家里。你的牧师和那些人在市政厅避难。他们被冲了出去。那场枪战可不是闹着玩的。死者就这样躺着，没有人埋葬他们。}
### {203}{}{Tell me more.}
{203}{}{告诉我更多。}
### {204}{}{And then everyone was taken to the square. Everyone was evaluated like some kind of bag of corn. Those who were stronger were taken separately, the rest were driven home and locked up.}
{204}{}{然后所有人都被带到广场上。每个人都被评价得像一袋玉米。那些比较强壮的人被单独带走，其余的人被赶回家并关起来。}
### {205}{}{What happened then?}
{205}{}{当时发生了什么？}

### {206}{}{At night, the raiders were not going to sleep - they robbed the Villa and got drunk. And in the morning they took our people and went to the Wastelands, to the east. Since then, it's been quiet and peaceful here. We sit and lick our wounds.}
{206}{}{晚上，袭击者根本睡不着――他们抢劫了别墅，喝得酩酊大醉。第二天早上，他们带着我们的人去了东边的荒原。从那以后，这里一直很安静。我们坐着舔舐伤口。}
### {207}{}{Who were these raiders?}
{207}{}{这些袭击者是谁？}
### {208}{}{You say they went east. Or rather?}
{208}{}{你说他们往东走了。或者更确切地说？}
### {209}{}{Why did the raiders take our people?}
{209}{}{为什么袭击者要带走我们的人？}
### {210}{}{Well, I think it's time for me to deal with this problem.}
{210}{}{好吧，我想是时候解决这个问题了。}
### {211}{}{They picked up all sorts of rabble from everywhere. I recognized someone from the Garage, but mostly people are not local and have never heard of such.}
{211}{}{他们到处抓来各种乌合之众。我认出了车库里的人，但大多数人都不是本地人，从来没有听说过这样的人。}
### {212}{}{I only know about Garage City in that direction. The raiders will probably wander there for the night.}
{212}{}{我只知道那个方向的车库城。袭击者可能会在那里过夜。}
### {213}{}{That's what they didn't tell old Jose about their plans. But you know what, it looks like they'll be forced to work. I don't know where or why.}
{213}{}{这就是他们没有告诉老何塞他们的计划。但你知道吗，看起来他们将被迫工作。我不知道在哪里，也不知道为什么。}
### {214}{}{And my parents?}
{214}{}{我的父母呢？}
### {215}{}{Sorry, they took them away. And your father. And Madre, too. Only the elderly were left and children.}
{215}{}{对不起，他们拿走了。还有你父亲。马德雷也是。只剩下老人和孩子。}

{216}{}{离开你愚蠢的乐观主义。我需要知道这里发生了什么。}
### {217}{}{It's terrible!}
{217}{}{太可怕了！}

### {220}{}{These are the words of the real Valiente Guerrero! What are you going to do now? Will you start chasing the raiders? They are already far away.}
{220}{}{这是真正的瓦利恩特・格雷罗的话！你现在打算做什么？你会开始追捕袭击者吗？他们已经很远了。}
### {221}{}{What do you advise me?}
{221}{}{你给我什么建议？}
### {222}{}{First tell me again about the raid.}
{222}{}{首先再告诉我这次突袭。}
### {223}{}{Well, first look into Garage City. It's a nasty place, but the raiders will probably look there. Ask around the locals, they have a chatty tongue when they are well cajoled.}
{223}{}{好吧，先看看车库城。这是一个令人讨厌的地方，但袭击者可能会在那里寻找。问问周围的当地人，当他们受到很好的哄骗时，他们的舌头会很健谈。}
### {224}{}{Cajoling?}
{224}{}{卡约林？}
### {225}{}{Be careful with those people, they will sell their own mother for profit. Here, take these fruits for the road and maize flour. They'll tell you anything for such things there.}
{225}{}{小心那些人，他们会出卖自己的母亲牟利。给，带上这些水果和玉米粉上路。他们会告诉你任何事情。}
### {226}{}{Thank you, Jose.}
{226}{}{谢谢你，何塞。}
### {227}{}{You're welcome. These raiders took out everything they could find. I'm giving you the last one. The main thing is to use it wisely.}
{227}{}{不客气。这些袭击者拿走了他们能找到的一切。我给你最后一个。最重要的是明智地使用它。}
### {228}{}{And that's it? What a miser you are.}
{228}{}{就这样？你真是个吝啬鬼。}
### {229}{}{Hey, the raiders took out everything they could find. I'm giving you the last one. The main thing is to use it wisely.}
{229}{}{嘿，袭击者拿走了他们能找到的所有东西。我给你最后一个。最重要的是明智地使用它。}
### {230}{}{Little, Jose. Need more.}
{230}{}{小，何塞。需要更多。}
### {231}{}{Just like that, will you take and leave your dear uncle without food? La-adno, here's some more. But I can't give you more. These raiders took out everything they could find.}
{231}{}{就这样，你会离开你亲爱的叔叔不吃东西吗？La adno，还有一些。但我不能再给你更多了。这些袭击者拿走了他们能找到的一切。}
### {232}{}{These raiders took out everything they could find. I'm giving you the last one. The main thing is to use it wisely.}
{232}{}{这些袭击者拿走了他们能找到的一切。我给你最后一个。最重要的是明智地使用它。}
### {233}{}{So then I'll have to figure it out on my own. Adios, Uncle Jose!}

### {234}{}{I see.}
{234}{}{我明白了。}

### {240}{}{Thank heaven, you came back and brought the others with you!}
{240}{}{谢天谢地，你回来了，把其他人也带来了！}
### {1240}{}{Thank heaven, you came back and brought the others with you!}
{1240}{}{谢天谢地，你回来了，把其他人也带来了！}
### {241}{}{Yes, it was not an easy journey. You know, there was a huge world outside the Villa. I've never been told about him.}
{241}{}{是的，这不是一段容易的旅程。你知道，别墅外面有一个巨大的世界。我从来没有听说过他。}
### {242}{}{And you'd better keep quiet too, amigo. Outsiders have their own truth, and we have our own. And we won't understand each other. That's why we live in isolation from the rest. So that no one tarnishes us, no one imposes their own rules on us. You already know what this raid has done. It's not worth repeating such a story, right?}
{242}{}{你最好也保持安静，朋友。局外人有他们自己的真相，我们也有自己的真相。我们不会互相理解。这就是为什么我们生活在与其他人隔绝的环境中。这样就没有人玷污我们，也没有人把自己的规则强加给我们。你已经知道这次突袭做了什么。这样的故事不值得重复，对吧？}
### {243}{}{I'll think about your words, Jose.}
{243}{}{我会考虑你的话，何塞。}

{259}{}{另一个问题。}

### {260}{}{Wild desert places. In the north there are cannibal savages, in the east there is a dump town, there are several other small villages and ranger camps. There is also a rumor about some big city, but I myself have never been further than the Garage.}
{260}{}{狂野的沙漠之地。北部有食人的野蛮人，东部有一个垃圾镇，还有其他几个小村庄和护林员营地。也有关于某个大城市的传言，但我自己从未去过车库。}
### {261}{}{Why do you call the neighborhood wild?}
{261}{}{你为什么说这个街区很狂野？}
### {262}{}{We've been trying to avoid strangers for years. Only if it presses hard, then we go to trade. Strangers cannot be trusted, they usually have neither families nor homes. Is it possible to make friends with such people? So your padre drove all the strangers away.}
{262}{}{多年来，我们一直试图避开陌生人。只有在压力很大的情况下，我们才能进行交易。陌生人是不可信任的，他们通常既没有家庭也没有家。有可能和这样的人交朋友吗？所以你的牧师把所有的陌生人都赶走了。}
### {263}{}{It seems that Villa's knowledge of the outside world is very limited. Don't you find it?}
{263}{}{维拉对外界的了解似乎非常有限。你没找到吗？}
### {264}{}{Aren't there enough raiders for you? And the cannibal savages? And the looters? No, it's not for nothing that we shut ourselves off from strangers. After all, there, in the wastelands, people do not live. And they survive.}
{264}{}{没有足够的袭击者给你吗？那些吃人的野蛮人呢？抢劫者呢？不，我们把自己与陌生人隔绝不是没有原因的。毕竟，在那里，在荒原上，人们并不生活。他们活了下来。}
### {265}{}{Tell me about the savages.}
{265}{}{告诉我野蛮人的事。}
### {266}{}{Jackals, that's what we call them. They are so wild that they don't even know the human language. And they also say that they are all cannibals. Fortunately, they can break off their fangs about us, but the scavengers from the neighboring city often told about them. So stay away from these savages.}
{266}{}{豺狼，这就是我们所说的。他们太狂野了，甚至不懂人类的语言。他们还说他们都是食人族。幸运的是，它们可以折断对我们的毒牙，但来自邻近城市的拾荒者经常谈论它们。所以离这些野蛮人远点。}
### {267}{}{Who are the Rangers?}
{267}{}{游骑兵队是谁？}
### {268}{}{Cool and self-confident guys. They say they are protecting us from the villains, but who will understand what they have in mind? Sometimes they come to show themselves, but we can cope without their help... and you know, now such help would be very useful to us.}
{268}{}{酷而自信的家伙。他们说他们在保护我们免受恶棍的伤害，但谁能理解他们的想法呢？有时他们来展示自己，但没有他们的帮助，我们可以应付...你知道，现在这样的帮助对我们非常有用。}
### {269}{}{If you haven't been, who has?}
{269}{}{如果你没有去过，谁去过？}
### {270}{}{Your Uncle Miguel, for example. He once quarreled with your padre and left the Villa. Haven't heard of him for years.}
{270}{}{比如你的米格尔叔叔。他曾经和你的牧师吵架，离开了别墅。多年没听说过他了。}
### {271}{}{Why did they quarrel?}
{271}{}{他们为什么吵架？}
### {272}{}{They had an argument about how Villa should deal with outsiders. One believed that it was necessary to drive them away, and the other offered to do business with them. They never found a common language. Although both were talking business.}
{272}{}{他们就维拉应该如何与外人打交道展开了争论。一个认为有必要把他们赶走，另一个则表示愿意和他们做生意。他们从未找到共同的语言。尽管两人都在谈生意。}

### {273}{}{Tell me about the neighboring city.}
{273}{}{告诉我邻近城市的情况。}
### {274}{}{Garage City? It's a bad town and the people there are bad.}
{274}{}{车库城？这是一个糟糕的城市，那里的人也很糟糕。}
### {275}{}{What kind of people live there?}
{275}{}{什么样的人住在那里？}
### {276}{}{Scavengers. That's what they call themselves. They walk through the ruins and look for something valuable. Be careful with them - they're all crooks and they smell bad.}
{276}{}{拾荒者。他们就是这么称呼自己的。他们穿过废墟，寻找有价值的东西。小心他们――他们都是骗子，而且气味难闻。}
### {277}{}{Where could Miguel have gone?}
{277}{}{米格尔可能去了哪里？}
### {278}{}{I remember he wanted to visit that big city, which is legendary. But I'm afraid he found nothing but death in the sand.}
{278}{}{我记得他想参观那个传说中的大城市。但恐怕他在沙子里只发现了死亡。}
### {279}{}{How do you know about Garage City?}
{279}{}{你怎么知道车库城的？}
### {280}{}{Hey, I'm the main dealer with outsiders in the Villa. Who better than me to know? Caravans sometimes come from there, we will exchange a few words and disperse peacefully.}
{280}{}{嘿，我是别墅里对外人的主要经销商。谁比我更了解？大篷车有时会从那里开来，我们会交换几句话，然后和平散去。}
### {281}{}{What is the relationship of the Villa with the Garage?}
{281}{}{别墅和车库是什么关系？}
### {282}{}{The padre hasn't told you yet, has he? Bad people live there. But we have to trade with them. We give them food, and they give us tools and repair services. That's where all our "relationships" end.}
{282}{}{牧师还没有告诉你，是吗？坏人住在那里。但我们必须与他们进行贸易。我们给他们食物，他们给我们工具和维修服务。这就是我们所有“关系”的终点。}
### {283}{}{It looks like you don't like this city.}
{283}{}{看起来你不喜欢这个城市。}
### {284}{}{You know old Jose - who treats me with kindness, so I treat him with the same. And these then trade dishonestly, then they want to steal, then they will say rude words. And after all, they have no better opinions about us. They are jealous that we live better than them.}
{284}{}{你知道老何塞，他对我很好，所以我对他也很好。然后这些人进行不诚实的交易，然后他们想偷窃，然后他们会说粗鲁的话。毕竟，他们对我们没有更好的评价。他们嫉妒我们比他们活得更好。}

{287}{}{（遗憾地摇摇头）额，朋友，这该死的荒原怎么把你打成那样了？！疼吗？好吧，即便如此。最重要的是不要担心――我们仍然支持你，我们是同父异母的。}

{293}{}{何塞叔叔，你肯定在撒谎。}
### {294}{}{Hey, amigo, enough of this! I'm just a merchant with a bad leg, I'm not privy to secrets. Yes, I know that the padre kept a secret place in the basement. And that family heirlooms were kept there, but it's not my business, you know?}
{294}{}{嘿，朋友，够了！我只是一个腿不好的商人，我不知道秘密。是的，我知道牧师在地下室有个秘密。那些传家宝都放在那里，但这不关我的事，你知道吗？}
### {295}{}{I would go anywhere with you, but at my age and with my bad leg you won't get far. Don't be angry, you can do it alone. I believe in you. We're the same blood, hey!}
{295}{}{我愿意和你一起去任何地方，但以我这个年纪，再加上我那糟糕的腿，你走不了多远。别生气，你可以一个人做。我相信你。我们是一样的血，嘿！}
