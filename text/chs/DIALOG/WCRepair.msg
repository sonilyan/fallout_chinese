#{286}{}{What's the problem with the controller?}
{286}{}{控制器有什么问题？}
#{287}{}{Why is it so hard to fix the car?}
{287}{}{为什么修车这么难？}
#{288}{}{Actually, there are several reasons. Imagine how it was during the Great War. The bombs mainly fell on cities, where the most of the cars were. Those that stayed mostly intact, being away from explosions, simply had no place to get repaired and refueled anymore. These pre-war cars, powered by nuclear batteries, were complex in terms of technology and maintenance, they required good care and constant monitoring. In addition, they were very expensive, and not everyone could afford to buy them. Also, add to the picture the horrors, that came after the War: the mass deaths, criminals everywhere, traffic jams on the streets... Loads of cars were left abandoned under the open sky, so in 70 years they just fell apart from aging. And these are just the few reasons.}
{288}{}{实际上，有几个原因。想象一下二战期间的情形。炸弹主要落在城市，那里的汽车最多。那些基本上完好无损，远离爆炸，根本没有地方去修理和加油了。这些战前由核电池驱动的汽车在技术和维护方面都很复杂，它们需要很好的保养和不断的监控。此外，它们非常昂贵，不是每个人都买得起。另外，再加上战后的恐怖：大规模死亡，到处都是罪犯，街道上交通堵塞。。。大量的汽车被遗弃在空旷的天空下，因此在70年的时间里，它们只是因为老化而解体。这些只是少数几个原因。}
#{289}{}{It remained in the garage of one of the houses in Pahrump. But the former owner used this car to the fullest, so I had a lot of trouble putting back parts and interior. The only problem left unsolved now is having a fuel controller.}
{289}{}{它留在帕伦普一所房子的车库里。但是前车主把这辆车用得很充分，所以我很难把零件和内饰放回去。现在唯一没有解决的问题是有一个燃料控制器。}
#{290}{}{}
{290}{}{}
#{291}{}{Controller is a chip which controls the distribution of power in the electric engine of the vehicle. These chips burned out fast, if the car hasn't been properly maintained. Mostly, it used to happen due to the fact, that the cars were too often pulled off with high-speed right from the start, in a sharp manner. While it's necessary to accelerate smoothly, from low levels. It is difficult to explain why this was happening. Anyway, in all of the few cars I managed to find in the neighborhoods, there were no working chip, that could be used for that kind of pickup truck.}
{291}{}{控制器是控制车辆电动发动机功率分配的芯片。如果汽车保养不好，这些芯片很快就烧坏了。大多数情况下，这种情况过去常常是因为这样一个事实，即汽车从一开始就被高速拉下来，以一种尖锐的方式。但必须平稳加速，从低水平开始。很难解释为什么会发生这种情况。不管怎么说，在我设法在附近找到的几辆车里，都没有可用于那种皮卡的芯片。}
#{292}{}{It's a really complex technology. More complex than computers, or even a radar station, believe me. Can you imagine how many electronics is in there? And the engine is literally a bomb! It took me a few years to roughly understand the structure of this car.}
{292}{}{这是一项非常复杂的技术。相信我，这比电脑，甚至是雷达站都复杂。你能想象里面有多少电子产品吗？引擎简直就是个炸弹！我花了几年时间才大致了解这辆车的结构。}
#{293}{}{Then look carefully. It hardly makes sense to search among the scrap metal abandoned under the open sky. I would start with the places, where cars stayed locked-in - garages and repair shops. And I should say, that I placed an order with the caravaneers in Vegas and Reno, but they all failed. Perhaps, you should look even further from civilization.}
{293}{}{然后仔细看。在空旷的天空下遗弃的废金属中搜寻几乎没有意义。我会从汽车锁在里面的地方开始――车库和修理店。我应该说，我向维加斯和雷诺的商队下了订单，但都失败了。也许，你应该从文明的角度看得更远。}
#{294}{}{We can talk about it for hours.}
{294}{}{我们可以谈几个小时。}

{296}{}{看起来像是在工作。。。哦，我兴奋得手都出汗了。}
#{297}{}{Not so fast! What do I get for this chip?}
{297}{}{别那么快！这个芯片我能得到什么？}
#{298}{}{That's a good question. Look, let's do like this: I'll buy this chip for 2000 in cash from you, then I'll fix the car - it will take some time - and then you can buy the whole truck. If you want to, of course.}
{298}{}{这是个好问题。听着，让我们这样做：我用2000美元的现金从你那里买这个芯片，然后我修车――这需要一些时间――然后你就可以买整辆卡车了。当然，如果你想的话。}

{334}{}{这太过分了。为了得到这笔钱，整个车队要工作一年。再想想，如果你不想失去一个客户。}
#{335}{}{Well, it's worth it. Where we shall fall in, tough guy?}
{335}{}{嗯，这是值得的。我们会在哪里跌倒，硬汉？}
#{336}{}{No, I don't like it. Goodbye.}
{336}{}{不，我不喜欢。再见。}
#{337}{}{Uh, strong argument... Okay, you win. I am willing to reduce the price by }
{337}{}{呃，强有力的论据。。。好吧，你赢了。我愿意降价}
#{338}{}{. But that's my final offer.}
{338}{}{. 但这是我最后的报价。}
#{339}{}{I understand. so now it's...}
{339}{}{我理解。所以现在。。。}
#{340}{}{Oh, okay. Let's go back to the previous price...}
{340}{}{哦，好吧。让我们回到以前的价格。。。}
#{341}{}{No, I've put too much work into this.}
{341}{}{不，我做了太多的工作。}
#{342}{}{You have earned 1000 bucks giving in to the technician. He was a cruel pervert. Bruises all over your body will hurt for some time.}
{342}{}{你已经赚了1000块给技术员了。他是个残忍的变态。你全身的瘀伤会痛一段时间。}
#{343}{}{On second thought, I will collect the money by other means.}
{343}{}{再想一想，我会用其他方法收钱的。}
#{344}{}{Baby, the money you gave me won't be enough even to compensate the treatment of bruises. I recall, you said something about your friends?}
{344}{}{宝贝，你给我的钱还不足以补偿治疗瘀伤的费用。我记得，你说过你朋友的事？}
#{345}{}{To make a sewed shotgun from a hunting shotgun.}
{345}{}{用猎枪缝制猎枪。}
#{346}{}{I'll come back later.}
{346}{}{我一会儿回来。}
#{347}{}{Are you sure you want this? Our guys from the garrison are exceptionally persistent, if allowed they may turn you into a pulp.}
{347}{}{你确定要这个吗？我们卫戍区的人非常固执，如果允许他们可能会把你变成一个废物。}
#{348}{}{Yes... I... Have to go through it for money.}
{348}{}{对。。。一、 。。。为了钱，我不得不经历它。}
#{349}{}{Simultaneous sex with five military men is a tough thing. You are happy to be alive. Nevertheless, you have earned 5000 bucks.}
{349}{}{与五名军人同时发生性关系是一件艰难的事情。你活着很高兴。不过，你已经赚了5000美元。}
#{371}{}{Have you ever seen the armor with such a helmet?}
{371}{}{你见过带这样头盔的盔甲吗？}
#{372}{}{[Carefully examines the helmet] actually it's not from armor, but from a sealed suit. I think it was used before the war in some laboratory.}
{372}{}{[仔细检查头盔]实际上不是盔甲，而是密封服。我想是战前在实验室里用的。}
#{373}{}{Is there a way to restore the main part?}
{373}{}{有没有办法还原主体部分？}
#{374}{}{The whole suit? Of course not! For the task like this I have neither tools, nor machines, nor materials. Ask mechanics in large industrial cities. In Salt Lake City, for example. The don't have such problems with equipment and components.}
{374}{}{整套衣服？当然不是！对于这样的任务，我既没有工具，也没有机器，也没有材料。问问大工业城市的机械师。比如在盐湖城。他们的设备和部件没有这样的问题。}
#{375}{}{Okay.}
{375}{}{可以。}
#{376}{}{Do you know anything about power armor?}
{376}{}{你知道动力装甲吗？}
#{377}{}{About the power armor blueprints.}
{377}{}{关于动力装甲蓝图。}
#{378}{}{Hmm...}
{378}{}{隐马尔可夫模型。。。}
#{379}{}{}
{379}{}{}
#{380}{}{A little bit. And all I know isn't worth a dime without high-tech machines and materials. But you can still see one working armor in Nevada. Wesker never takes one off, he will stay in it till he dies, I think...}
{380}{}{一点点。如果没有高科技的机器和材料，我所知道的一切都一文不值。但在内华达州你仍然可以看到一件正在使用的盔甲。韦斯克从不脱掉，他会一直呆到死，我想。。。}
#{381}{}{Wesker wears a working one?}
{381}{}{韦斯克穿工作服？}
#{382}{}{Not exactly. It has no helmet, it can't be fully sealed and some features are not working. Servicemen brought this junk from the test site in Hawthorne. It was used for durability testing there - so now it's made of holes, which are made of holes.}
{382}{}{不完全是。它没有头盔，不能完全密封，有些功能不起作用。军人从霍桑的试验场带来了这些垃圾。它在那里被用来做耐久性测试-所以现在它是由孔组成的，这些孔是由孔组成的。}
#{383}{}{And how this remnants were repaired?}
{383}{}{这些残余物是如何修复的？}
#{384}{}{They were not. It is what it is. There is no components, no tools, let alone the production machines. But why the hell are you interrogating me?!}
{384}{}{他们不是。就是这样。没有零件，没有工具，更不用说生产机器了。但你为什么要审问我？！}
#{385}{}{Obviously, I would like the armor like this for my personal use.}
{385}{}{很明显，我想要这样的盔甲供我个人使用。}
#{386}{}{Just out of curiosity. Thank you for explaining everything I wanted to know.}
{386}{}{只是出于好奇。谢谢你解释了我想知道的一切。}
#{387}{}{Of course... Who wouldn't... But it doesn't matter. Wesker will not part with the armor, and we don't have another one. Even with all the blueprints on hand, we won't be able to arrange the production, it's too complicated and time-consuming. Before the war, the entire production facilities were up on producing them, there have been hundreds of specialists, high-precision machines, the prototypes took years to mature, and now you come here and say "I want one of these". Ha!}
{387}{}{当然。。。谁不会。。。但这不重要。韦斯克不会放弃盔甲，我们也没有另一个。即使有所有的图纸在手，我们也不能安排生产，这太复杂和费时了。战前，整个生产设施都在生产，有数百名专家，高精度的机器，原型机花了几年时间才成熟，现在你来这里说“我想要一台”。哈！}
#{388}{}{So no working suit has survived up to the present day except the one on Wesker?}
{388}{}{所以到今天为止，除了韦斯克身上的那件外，没有一件工作服幸存下来？}
#{389}{}{All you can get are useless blueprints. Power armors were in possession of military units, and even back then they were in shortage. What do you think, where are they now? Of course, whether on military bases where we can't reach them, or destroyed over time. I say - head to the East, to Washington, and who knows, maybe you can find one among the ruins of the capital. Heh, good luck with that.}
{389}{}{你能得到的只是无用的蓝图。武装装甲部队拥有军事单位，即使在那时，他们是短缺的。你觉得呢，他们现在在哪里？当然，无论是在我们无法到达的军事基地，还是随着时间的推移被摧毁。我说――往东走，去华盛顿，谁知道呢，也许你能在首都的废墟中找到一个。嘿，祝你好运。}
#{390}{}{I see... Wait, blueprints? Do you have the blueprints?!}
{390}{}{我懂了。。。等等，蓝图？你有蓝图吗？！}
#{391}{}{Damn, I finally blurted out, didn't I? I don't know why you need them, but this sort of things is not handed out to complete strangers. There are blueprints of the frame structure at the headquarters, but that's only a part of the whole documentation. And, of course, no one will hand it to you.}
{391}{}{妈的，我终于脱口而出了，不是吗？我不知道你为什么需要它们，但这种东西不是发给陌生人的。总部有框架结构的蓝图，但那只是整个文件的一部分。当然，没有人会把它交给你。}
#{392}{}{I am able to buy it.}
{392}{}{我可以买它。}
#{393}{}{*You're* going to get me the blueprints.}
{393}{}{*你要给我拿蓝图。}
#{394}{}{I'll try. The headquarters, you say? Okay, I'll go see what's this all about.}
{394}{}{我试试看。你说是总部？好吧，我去看看这是怎么回事。}
#{395}{}{To BUY!? You won't have the amount enough to pay for such a rare documentation!}
{395}{}{去买！？你不会有足够的钱来支付这样一个罕见的文件！}
#{396}{}{I thought you said they are worthless?}
{396}{}{我以为你说它们一文不值？}
#{397}{}{When there is a buyer, everything gets a price. Okay, so be it, I'll get you the blueprints. For 3000 bucks.}
{397}{}{当有买家的时候，每样东西都有一个价格。好吧，随你吧，我给你拿蓝图。3000块。}
#{398}{}{Okay, I need those blueprints. Here is the payment.}
{398}{}{好的，我需要那些蓝图。这是付款单。}
#{399}{}{That much!? I thought the huckster is sitting in the next room, but this... I'd rather find another way.}
{399}{}{那么多！？我以为那家伙坐在隔壁，但这。。。我宁愿另辟蹊径。}
#{400}{}{[You wistfully wait behind the locked doors while the technician goes out somewhere on the territory of the headquarters; finally he returns with the holodisk in his hand, warily looking around] If I'd have been paid for this stuff routinely, I would have bought the whole Vegas by now. Don't say a word to anyone!}
{400}{}{[你渴望地在锁着的门后等着，而技术人员却在总部的某个地方外出；最后他手里拿着全息光盘回来了，小心翼翼地环顾四周]如果我按惯例得到这些东西的报酬，我现在就可以买下整个维加斯了。不要对任何人说一句话！}
#{401}{}{No problem.}
{401}{}{没问题。}
#{402}{}{Is that so? And why would I do that?}
{402}{}{是这样吗？我为什么要这么做？}
#{403}{}{Because I'll pay.}
{403}{}{因为我会付钱的。}
#{404}{}{Because if you don't, I'll report you to Wesker.}
{404}{}{因为如果你不这样做，我会把你报告给韦斯克。}
#{405}{}{If you don't need it, I will not insist.}
{405}{}{如果你不需要，我不会坚持的。}
#{406}{}{Buddy, look at my kind and sympathetic face. How could I do something bad to the wanderer of the Wasteland?}
{406}{}{伙计，看看我和蔼而富有同情心的脸。我怎么能对荒原的流浪者做坏事呢？}
#{407}{}{You gave yourself away - you tried to kill me, but I got your note from the body of a mercenary.}
{407}{}{你出卖了自己-你想杀我，但我从一个雇佣兵的尸体上得到了你的字条。}
#{408}{}{[Looks like he considers to shoot you on the spot, but suddenly changes in face] As you wish. It's easy for me to get the blueprints. But when I do, you'll give the note back and I will destroy it.}
{408}{}{[看起来他想当场向你开枪，但突然脸色变了]如你所愿。我很容易拿到蓝图。但当我这么做的时候，你会把纸条还给我，我会销毁它。}
#{409}{}{Sure, let's do it.}
{409}{}{当然，我们来吧。}
#{410}{}{Don't rush things, I need to think this over.}
{410}{}{别着急，我得考虑一下。}
#{411}{}{Where?}
{411}{}{在哪里？}
#{412}{}{Uh...}
{412}{}{休斯敦大学。。。}
#{413}{}{[You wistfully wait behind the locked doors while the technician goes out somewhere on the territory of the headquarters; finally he returns with the holodisk in his hand, warily looking around] I got what you wanted. Now it's your turn.}
{413}{}{[你渴望地在锁着的门后等着，而技术人员却在总部的某个地方外出；最后他手里拿着全息光盘回来了，小心翼翼地环顾四周]我得到了你想要的。现在轮到你了。}
#{414}{}{All right. We will part ways peacefully and quietly.}
{414}{}{好吧。我们会平静地分手。}
#{415}{}{It failed...}
{415}{}{它失败了。。。}
#{1111}{}{Oops, I thought it's a toilet...}
{1111}{}{哦，我以为是个厕所。。。}
#{1114}{}{That's it, you're screwed!}
{1114}{}{就这样，你完蛋了！}
#{1115}{}{What?! But I did nothing!..}
{1115}{}{什么？！但我什么也没做！。。}
#{1146}{}{Got it.}
{1146}{}{知道了。}
#{1168}{}{Have read on the old holodisk.}
{1168}{}{我读过旧的全息光盘。}
#{1175}{}{Damn, look, I want to warn you - there are those in our community who must not see this tape. This... Could lead to unpleasant consequences. [menacingly approaches you] Do you understand me, outlander? Unpleasant *for us all* and for you in particular. Don't do anything stupid.}
{1175}{}{妈的，听着，我想警告你-我们社区里有些人不能看这盘带子。这个。。。可能导致不愉快的后果。[威胁地接近你]你明白我的意思吗，外地人？对我们所有人来说，尤其是对你来说，都是不愉快的。别做傻事。}
#{1234}{}{I changed my mind. It is not necessary.}
{1234}{}{我改变主意了。这是没有必要的。}
#{1312}{}{[Goggles in horror at you] What are you doing, you idiot?!! It's a very fragile thing!!!}
{1312}{}{你在干什么，白痴？！！这是一个非常脆弱的东西！！！}
#{1315}{}{Yours? It's still *my* truck, weirdo! And, you know - it's just gorgeous! All my life I have been dreaming of thing like this, and I don't know if I'm ready to sell it to a complete stranger.}
{1315}{}{你的？它还是我的卡车，怪人！而且，你知道的-真是太棒了！我一生都在梦想这样的事情，我不知道我是否准备把它卖给一个完全陌生的人。}
#{1407}{}{You gave yourself away - you tried to kill me, but I got your note from the body of a mercenary.}
{1407}{}{你出卖了自己-你想杀我，但我从一个雇佣兵的尸体上得到了你的字条。}
