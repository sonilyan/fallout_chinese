{1200}{}{这是我们的女主角。经过我们的营救，整个别墅都欠你。这是一个真正的壮举。}
### {201}{}{How did you get to the Villa?}
{201}{}{你是怎么到别墅的？}
### {202}{}{The path was not close. And very difficult. We were saved by unity and cohesion, in this the inhabitants of the Villa have always differed from the savages.}
{202}{}{路径不近。而且非常困难。我们被团结和凝聚力拯救了，在这一点上，别墅的居民总是与野蛮人不同。}
### {203}{}{Perhaps.}
{203}{}{可能}
### {204}{}{Oh my God! What have these damned wastelands done to you? Your skin feels like... burned! How are you doing? Can you talk? Ugh, I don't know what to think. It looks like you're going to stay in this skin forever. I am so sorry. But don't worry - we will definitely find a cure for this disease.}
{204}{}{天啊！这些该死的荒原对你做了什么？你的皮肤感觉。。。烧了！你好吗？你会说话吗？啊，我不知道该怎么想。看起来你将永远保持这种皮肤。我很抱歉。但别担心，我们一定会找到治愈这种疾病的方法。}

{222}{}{为什么世界的其他地方对别墅的居民隐藏起来？我设法参观了各种不寻常的地方，这是。。。意想不到的经历。}
### {223}{}{Ah! Look at the Villa. When the Founder brought people here, it was a lifeless wasteland. Our ancestors invested their whole lives so that at least something edible could grow here. They succeeded only thanks to their faith in the precepts of the Founder: work for the good of the community, share your gains with everyone and do not let strangers in.}
{223}{}{啊！看看别墅。当创始人把人们带到这里时，这里是一片死气沉沉的荒地。我们的祖先投入了他们的一生，这样至少可以在这里种植一些可食用的东西。他们的成功归功于他们对创始人戒律的信仰：为社区的利益工作，与每个人分享你的收获，不要让陌生人进来。}
### {224}{}{[Listen]}
{224}{}{[听]}
### {225}{}{Tell me, are there many places outside the Villa where gardens also bloom and peace reigns? In this case, we have nothing to learn from the "rest of the world".}
{225}{}{告诉我，别墅外有没有很多地方花园也盛开，和平盛行？在这种情况下，我们没有什么可以向“世界其他地方”学习的。}

{226}{}{但世界正在改变。你认为维拉不需要改变吗？}
### {227}{}{What changes can there be? Grow the harvest and share with everyone - that's all the change that can be in our community. Of course, we sometimes need things from the outside, but they can always be exchanged for our fruits. Don't fill your head with unnecessary thoughts. The outside world has lost its way and is going the wrong way. Someday it ends in an abyss.}
{227}{}{会有什么变化？收获并与每个人分享――这就是我们社区可能发生的所有变化。当然，我们有时需要来自外部的东西，但它们总是可以用来交换我们的水果。不要让你的脑子里充满不必要的想法。外面的世界迷失了方向，走错了路。总有一天它会在深渊中结束。}
### {228}{}{I'll think about your words.}
{228}{}{我会好好想想你的话。}
### {229}{}{Okay, forget it.}

{230}{}{你知道，社区会因为克里斯的懦弱而惩罚他。}

{231}{}{我试图说服委员会减轻处罚，但法律凌驾于我之上。显然，人们需要发泄情绪，他们决定利用克里斯。也许这样会更好。无论如何，不要与多数人的意见相矛盾。}

{270}{}{委员会想炸毁弗拉格斯塔夫煤矿。你觉得这个主意怎么样？}

{273}{}{市政委员会决定摧毁车库城的工厂。你觉得怎么样？}
### {274}{}{The scavengers have already shown their corrupt nature. They cannot be trusted, they do not have warm neighborly feelings for us. When they launch the plant, a flood of new labor will flow here. This cannot be allowed if we want to preserve our way of life and peaceful life.}
{274}{}{拾荒者已经显示出他们腐败的本性。他们不能被信任，他们对我们没有睦邻友好的感情。当他们启动工厂时，大量的新劳动力将涌入这里。如果我们想保持我们的生活方式和平静的生活，这是不允许的。}

{276}{}{你觉得和游骑兵队结盟怎么样？}
### {277}{}{We need allies, and we can't find better rangers. But I am afraid that they will interfere in our internal affairs. This should not be allowed. Let them take food and protect us from robbers. Don't settle for more.}
{277}{}{我们需要盟友，我们找不到更好的护林员了。但我担心他们会干涉我们的内政。这是不应该被允许的。让他们拿走食物，保护我们免受抢劫。不要满足于更多。}

### {291}{}{The jailers forced me to work, but at the same time they treated me with leniency, because I am a woman. What can not be said about men. Those they used sometimes with extreme cruelty. However, they did not want to lose their labor force either, so they were mainly engaged in intimidating slaves.}
{291}{}{狱警强迫我工作，但同时他们对我宽大处理，因为我是个女人。男人有什么不能说的。他们有时极其残忍地使用这些东西。然而，他们也不想失去劳动力，所以他们主要从事恐吓奴隶的活动。}
### {292}{}{And ordinary citizens?}
{292}{}{普通公民呢？}
### {293}{}{The colonists tried not to talk to me. I think they themselves are not in a particularly free position because of the large taxes. It is not surprising that even the family pendant, inherited from my grandmother, was taken away from me. Although it does not represent any value to the colonists.}
{293}{}{殖民者尽量不和我说话。我认为他们自己并没有处于特别自由的地位，因为税收太高。即使是从我祖母那里继承的家族吊坠也被拿走了，这并不奇怪。尽管它对殖民者来说没有任何价值。}
### {294}{}{Why would someone need your pendant?}
{294}{}{为什么有人需要你的吊坠？}
### {295}{}{Well, he said he would get "good caps" from the bartender for it. I doubt that he helped out at least one and a half caps.}
