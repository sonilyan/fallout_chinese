{354}{}{●呜咽。：：请走开。我想一个人呆着。}
#{500}{}{Hi. I'm glad you got better. Your injuries looked pretty bad. [He pauses for a minute.] I wanted to ask you for a favor. My son Tommy disappeared. He was supposed to watch the brahmin, but when I went to check on him, I only found you. I'm starting to get worried. He has never been gone for this long. Do you think that... Could you look for him?}
{500}{}{你好。我很高兴你好转了。你的伤看起来很严重。[他停顿了一下]我想请你帮个忙。我儿子汤米失踪了。他本该看双头牛的，但当我去看他的时候，我只找到了你。我开始担心了。他从未离开这么久。你认为。。。你能找他吗？}
#{501}{}{Yes, definitely. What does he look like?}
{501}{}{是的，当然。他长什么样？}
#{503}{}{No, I have enough of my own problems. Goodbye.}

#{551}{}{I changed my mind. I'll help you find your son. What does he look like?}
{551}{}{我改变主意了。我会帮你找到你儿子的。他长什么样？}
#{552}{}{I have bad news for you. Your son is dead. I found his corpse in that cave past the pastures.}
{552}{}{我有个坏消息要告诉你。你儿子死了。我在牧场那边的山洞里发现了他的尸体。}
#{553}{}{Nothing, actually. Bye.}
{553}{}{其实没什么。再见。}
#{554}{}{Ugh.}
{554}{}{啊。}
#{555}{}{Tommie deader. Bad bug, bam!}
{555}{}{汤米死了。坏虫子，砰！}
#{600}{}{Thank you. [He describes Tommy's appearance to you.] I hope you can find him soon.}

#{601}{}{Me too. See ya.}
{601}{}{我也是。再见。}
#{603}{}{I... I'm sorry, but that description matches a corpse I saw in the cave.}
{603}{}{一、 。。。对不起，但那描述和我在山洞里看到的尸体吻合。}
#{650}{}{What? No, that can't be true! Why would he go there? He knew how dangerous it is. He must have known. He... [He starts sobbing.]}
{650}{}{什么？不，那不可能是真的！他为什么要去那里？他知道这有多危险。他一定知道。他。。。[他开始抽泣]}
#{651}{}{It's probably somehow related to this necklace. [Show it to him.] He had it on him.}
{651}{}{可能和这条项链有关。他身上带着。}
#{652}{}{He was trying to hide Rachel's necklace. He was a thief.}
{652}{}{他想把瑞秋的项链藏起来。他是个小偷。}
#{653}{}{It's probably somehow related to the necklace he had on him.}
{653}{}{可能和他身上的项链有关。}
#{700}{}{[He looks at the necklace.] So it's true. This belongs to Rachel. Tommy... Tommy must have stolen it.}
{700}{}{[他看着项链]所以这是真的。这是瑞秋的。汤米。。。汤米一定偷了。}
#{701}{}{I'm sorry. But I must return that necklace.}
{701}{}{我很抱歉。但我必须归还那条项链。}
#{703}{}{Look at the bright side. He's dead now, so at least he won't steal anything else. It actually turned out rather well.}
{703}{}{看看好的一面。他现在死了，所以至少他不会偷别的东西。结果却相当不错。}
#{750}{}{Please, wait. It can't end like this. I don't want Tommy to be remembered as a thief. I wouldn't be able to bear that.}
{750}{}{请等一下。不能就这样结束。我不想让别人记住汤米是个小偷。我受不了了。}

#{753}{}{Tommy deserves that reputation. I won't lie for him.}
{753}{}{汤米应该得到这样的名声。我不会为他撒谎。}
#{754}{}{It's too late for that. The necklace is back with Rachel.}
{754}{}{为时已晚。蕾切尔把项链还给你了。}
#{800}{}{You must somehow plant the necklace. Perhaps hide it among her things or something like that. But it must look like she just forgot it somewhere. Hopefully that will work.}
{800}{}{你一定要想办法把项链栽进去。也许把它藏在她的东西里之类的。但她一定是忘在什么地方了。希望这能奏效。}
#{801}{}{I'll see what I can do.}
{801}{}{我看看我能做什么。}
#{802}{}{I'll try, but not for free. How much will you pay for this?}
{802}{}{我试试看，但不是免费的。你要付多少钱？}
