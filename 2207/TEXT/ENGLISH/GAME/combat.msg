{5018}{}{, inflicting an extra helping of damage}
{5019}{}{ with no armor, knocking the combatant to the ground}

{5024}{}{, bowling him over and crippling that leg}
{5025}{}{, smashing the knee into the next town. He falls}
{5026}{}{. The intense pain of having a leg removed causes him to quit}
{5027}{}{ inflicting some extra pain}
{5028}{}{ causing blindness, unluckily for him}
{5029}{}{, and with no protection there, causing serious pain}
{5030}{}{, and blinding him with a stunning blow}
{5031}{}{. The loss of an eye is too much for him, and he falls to the ground}
{5032}{}{, sadly, he is too busy feeling the rush of air on the brain to notice death approaching}
{5033}{}{. Ouch! That had to hurt}
{5034}{}{, and he's not wearing a cup, either}
{5035}{}{ and without protection, he falls over, groaning in agony}
{5036}{}{. The pain is too much for him and he collapses like a rag}

{5112}{}{. The left arm is barely attached to her shoulder}
{5113}{}{. That arm now looks like a bloody stump}
{5114}{}{, leaving a crippled right arm}
{5115}{}{. Her right arm is turned into hamburger by the blow}

{5127}{}{ inflicting some extra pain}

{5129}{}{, and with no protection there, causing serious pain}
{5130}{}{. The wound causes severe blindness, as if there is any other kind}
{5131}{}{. She faints from the blinding attack}
{5132}{}{, sadly, she doesn't get to pray to her gods before she meets them}
{5133}{}{. She takes it like a man. That is to say, it hurts}

{5203}{}{. The blow is strong, and the child is knocked unconscious}
{5204}{}{, smashing the small child around like a limp rag}
{5205}{}{. The left arm of this kid now has an owie}
{5206}{}{, throwing the small child off balance}
{5207}{}{, breaking that arm with a loud snap. Some serious tears start to flow}
{5208}{}{, easily snapping that arm like a small piece of candy}
{5209}{}{. The right arm starts to swell, like a balloon}
{5210}{}{, and starts to cry}
