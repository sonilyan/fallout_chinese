{115}{}{非常感谢。至少我不会饿死。}

### {200}{}{? It's you... Not surprisingly, I suspected that you, the new hero of the Villa, would be sent to search. Now they see you as a leader. I probably don't want to lose my special status, right?}
{200}{}{？是你...毫不奇怪，我怀疑你，别墅的新英雄，会被派去搜查。现在他们把你看作领导者。我可能不想失去我的特殊身份，对吧？}
### {201}{}{So why did you run away from the community?}
{201}{}{那你为什么要逃离社区？}
### {202}{}{They want to execute me. You know. Why these unnecessary questions?}
{202}{}{他们想处决我。为什么这些不必要的问题？}

### {220}{}{Why are they mad at you?}
{220}{}{他们为什么生你的气？}
### {221}{}{Like you, I avoided the raiders. But only because he hid from them in the cellars. Now the residents cannot forgive this and consider me a traitor. And traitors in the Villa have always been disliked.}
{221}{}{和你一样，我避开了袭击者。但这只是因为他躲在地窖里躲避他们。现在居民们不能原谅我，认为我是叛徒。别墅里的叛徒一直都不受欢迎。}

### {226}{}{[Next]}
{226}{}{[下一个]}
### {227}{}{Funny. The villa exists thanks to these ruins. Now they keep me alive. But no one knows anything about their past and about the people who lived here. Perhaps in other cities with a different way of life, not like in a Villa, I will find my place.}
{227}{}{有趣的别墅因这些废墟而存在。现在他们让我活着。但没有人知道他们的过去和住在这里的人。也许在其他有着不同生活方式的城市，而不是在别墅里，我会找到自己的位置。}
### {228}{}{What are you going to do?}
{228}{}{你打算怎么办？}
### {229}{}{I don't know. I can't hide for long, and there's nowhere much to run. I've heard about the rangers and the scavengers from the neighboring town. But to go there, you need provisions. (bitter smile) Don't follow her to the Villa.}
{229}{}{我不知道。我躲不了多久，也没什么可跑的。我听说过附近城镇的护林员和拾荒者。但要去那里，你需要食物。（苦笑）不要跟着她去别墅。}

{230}{}{如果我给你拿了食物，你就可以离开这些地方。但你再也回不来了。}
### {231}{}{I know! Maybe that's what I've always wanted, but I was afraid to admit it. Among our people, most did not even try to learn anything about the outside world. They have lived their way for decades and are ready to throw stones for any change in it... I want to be free, amigo. Give me a chance!}
{231}{}{我知道！也许这是我一直想要的，但我不敢承认。在我们的人民中，大多数人甚至没有尝试了解外面的世界。他们已经按照自己的方式生活了几十年，并准备为任何改变扔石头……我想自由，朋友。给我一个机会！}
### {232}{}{Okay, I'll get you some provisions for the trip. Wait here.}
{232}{}{好的，我给你带些旅行的食物。在这里等候。}
### {233}{}{No. My reputation is important to me. And besides, you deserve to be punished. Pack up, we're going back to the community.}
{233}{}{不，我的名誉对我来说很重要。此外，你应该受到惩罚。收拾行李，我们要回到社区。}
### {234}{}{First of all, I need to know the details of this story.}
