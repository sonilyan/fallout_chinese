#{100}{}{You see a merchant.}
{100}{}{你看到一个商人。}
#{101}{}{You see a caravan leader. Judging by his tanned skin, he often traveled.}
{101}{}{你看到一个商队队长。从他晒黑的皮肤来看，他经常旅行。}
#{102}{}{Move away from me!}
{102}{}{离我远点！}
#{103}{}{All my merchandise is destroyed! I'm ruined! I'm broke!!!}
{103}{}{我所有的商品都毁了！我完了！我破产了！！！}
#{104}{}{Tomorrow we won17t be here.}
{104}{}{明天我们就不在这儿了。}
#{105}{}{Enjoy the marvelous taste of Nuka-Cola!}
{105}{}{享受努卡可乐的美妙味道！}
#{106}{}{Oh...}
{106}{}{哦。。。}
#{107}{}{Thanks to you our future is finally a little bit brighter. Thanks.}
{107}{}{多亏了你，我们的未来终于有点光明了。谢谢。}
#{108}{}{The goods in the wagon were completely destroyed.}
{108}{}{货车上的货物被完全毁坏了。}
#{110}{}{Hey, do your feet burn from the road? Here, have a bottle for refreshment. It will cost you only 3 bucks.}
{110}{}{嘿，你的脚在路上烧焦了吗？来，喝一瓶点心。你只要花3块钱。}
#{111}{}{Tempting, but what is this drink and where it came from?}
{111}{}{很诱人，但这种饮料是什么？它是从哪里来的？}
#{112}{}{Thank you, but no.}
{112}{}{谢谢你，但是不要。}
#{113}{}{Well, I was lucky to find a few boxes of pre-war Nuka-Cola. I've tried it - absolutely clean and a quality product! [as if whispering] And, by the way, much better than at the local factory.}
{113}{}{嗯，我很幸运找到了几盒战前的努卡可乐。我试过了-绝对干净而且是优质产品！[好像在窃窃私语]而且，顺便说一句，比在当地工厂好多了。}
#{114}{}{So you have nothing to do with the local Nuka-Cola factory?}
{114}{}{所以你和当地的努卡可乐厂无关？}
#{115}{}{Oh, no. I17m not local myself, and I was surprised, when I learned that there is a whole factory here. So I have to sell cola cheaper, to sell it faster before the factory thugs come to find out... Although I'm probably exaggerating, he-he. Why such a large factory should care about some small seller from the Wastes?}
{115}{}{哦，不。我自己也不是本地人，当我得知这里有一整座工厂时，我很惊讶。所以我得把可乐卖的便宜一点，在工厂暴徒发现之前卖得快一点。。。虽然我可能有点夸张，他说。为什么这么大的一个工厂要关心一些小卖家的废物？}
#{116}{}{Maybe. But the factory wouldn't like it for sure.}
{116}{}{也许 吧。但工厂肯定不喜欢。}
#{117}{}{Fortunately, in this town there is a Sheriff that honors law and justice. So I can sell you a few bottles. That is what you standing here for, right?}
{117}{}{幸运的是，在这个镇上有一个尊重法律和正义的治安官。所以我可以卖给你几瓶。你站在这里就是为了这个，对吧？}
#{118}{}{Yeah.}
{118}{}{是 啊。}
#{119}{}{Come. Only 3 bucks a bottle!}
{119}{}{来吧。一瓶才3块钱！}
#{120}{}{Give me a bottle of pre-war Nuka-Cola.}
{120}{}{给我一瓶战前的努卡可乐。}
#{121}{}{Give me three bottles of pre-war Nuka-Cola.}
{121}{}{给我三瓶战前的努卡可乐。}
#{122}{}{Did you know that your Cola reeks of radiation from a mile away?}
{122}{}{你知道你的可乐有一英里外的辐射味吗？}
#{123}{}{At a local factory, I was asked to eliminate your annoying ass. But I can consider peaceful alternatives.}
{123}{}{在当地的一家工厂，我被要求除掉你讨厌的屁股。但我可以考虑和平的替代品。}
#{124}{}{Hey, don't be stupid! The Sheriff himself gave the permission to sell here, though threatened to throw out of the city, if any fuss happens because of me. Besides, the local caravan won't approve. Well, then... It's not fair! I have honestly earned my goods and dragged them here on my back. And now it turns out that because of this I17m a criminal. All because the factory does not want to recognize the most important thing - that their product is much worse than pre-war one. You just try it and will immediately feel the difference! Want some?}
{124}{}{嘿，别傻了！警长本人同意在这里出售，尽管他威胁说，如果因为我而引起任何骚动，他将被赶出这个城市。另外，当地的商队不会批准的。那么。。。这不公平！我真的挣到了我的货，把它们背在我的背上拖到这里。现在发现因为这个我是个罪犯。这一切都是因为工厂不想认识到最重要的一点――他们的产品比战前差得多。你只要尝试一下，就会立刻感受到不同！想要一些吗？}
#{125}{}{Unlike your goods, the products of the factory do not stink radiation from a mile away.}
{125}{}{与你们的产品不同，这家工厂的产品不会散发出一英里外的辐射臭味。}
#{126}{}{Really? Wow, what a surprise... Well, I'll have to... Uh... Smash it all somewhere on the outskirts of the city.}
{126}{}{真正地？哇，真是个惊喜。。。好吧，我得。。。休斯敦大学。。。在市郊的某个地方把它砸碎。}
#{127}{}{You're a bad actor. You knew that the bottles are irradiated, but still brought them to sell to the local population. Isn17t your conscience tormenting you?}
{127}{}{你是个坏演员。你知道这些瓶子是经过辐射的，但还是拿来卖给当地人。你的良心不是在折磨你吗？}
#{128}{}{[He starts to look tired] Maybe... But listen. In the village, where me and my son are from, is nobody left, 'cause to live there became impossible. One day I found out about an abandoned truck of Nuka-Cola. The batch in my wagon is all that was there. Honestly. I just wanted to make a quick buck and get out of town. Me and my son are left without shelter and food, we need something to buy supplements and ammunition with. In other circumstances, I wouldn't have to climb into irradiated truck. Besides, bottles not so heavily irradiated that anyone would notice.}
{128}{}{[他开始看起来很累]也许。。。但是听着。在我和我儿子的村子里，一个人也没有了，因为在那里生活是不可能的。有一天我发现一辆废弃的努卡可乐卡车。我马车里的那一批就是那里的全部。说真的？我只是想赚个快钱然后离开这个城市。我和我儿子没有住所和食物，我们需要一些东西来买补充剂和弹药。在其他情况下，我就不必爬上卡车了。此外，瓶子没有那么严重的辐射，任何人都会注意到。}
#{129}{}{Then I can buy all your cola.}
{129}{}{那我就可以买你所有的可乐了。}
#{130}{}{Then I will report you to the police.}
{130}{}{那我就报警。}
#{131}{}{Drop the shit until the police have you arrested and get you out of town.}
{131}{}{在警察逮捕你并把你弄出城之前别胡说了。}
#{132}{}{I need to think about it.}
{132}{}{我需要考虑一下。}
#{133}{}{Don't even dare! We put so much work to get those bottles and bring them here! Please, have mercy on me and my son! We have nowhere to go, our village is empty. I promise we'll leave once we get some supplies and ammo for the road.}
{133}{}{不敢！我们花了这么多功夫才弄到那些瓶子，然后把它们带到这里来！拜托，可怜我和我儿子吧！我们无处可去，我们的村庄空无一人。我保证我们一拿到路上的补给和弹药就走。}
#{134}{}{Eh... Even so, we have no choice. We have nowhere to go, our village is empty. I promise we'll leave once we get some supplies and ammo for the road.}
{134}{}{呃。。。即便如此，我们也别无选择。我们无处可去，我们的村庄空无一人。我保证我们一拿到路上的补给和弹药就走。}
#{135}{}{Well, no. You'll HAVE to leave NOW!}
{135}{}{哦，不。你现在得走了！}
#{136}{}{I want to buy this drink.}
{136}{}{我想买这种饮料。}
#{137}{}{GREAT! How many bottles?}
{137}{}{伟大的！有多少瓶？}
#{138}{}{}
{138}{}{}
#{139}{}{ for }
{139}{}{对于}
#{140}{}{ buck[s].}
{140}{}{巴克。}
#{141}{}{All }
{141}{}{全部}
#{142}{}{Thanks! If you want more - come again.}
{142}{}{谢谢！如果你想要更多-再来一次。}
#{143}{}{Okay.}
{143}{}{可以。}
#{144}{}{Thanks... Hey, look! The last box is empty, which cannot be said about my pockets. Hehe, it's finally over and we can leave. Thank you, your help was very welcome!}
{144}{}{谢谢。。。嘿，看！最后一个盒子是空的，不能说是我的口袋。呵呵，总算结束了，我们可以走了。谢谢你，非常欢迎你的帮助！}
#{145}{}{This is good.}
{145}{}{这很好。}
#{146}{}{Why not to work for the factory as an official courier? You have all the necessary qualities.}
{146}{}{为什么不去工厂做一个正式的快递员呢？你具备所有必要的素质。}
#{147}{}{That'd be great, but they decided that we aren't suitable for them. For some reason I was not able to make a deal with these guys. They believe that the courier should have a good look and smell. Although I know this region pretty well and I17m good with hunting rifle, and this is more important than a representative look. And I know much better the mentality of local people than these city snobs. But managers at the factory do not think so.}
{147}{}{那太好了，但他们认为我们不适合他们。不知什么原因，我没能和这些家伙达成协议。他们认为，快递员应该有一个良好的外观和气味。虽然我对这个地区非常了解，而且我擅长猎枪，但这比一个代表性的外观更重要。我比这些城市势利者更了解当地人的心理。但工厂的经理们并不这么认为。}
#{148}{}{Hmm. I see.}
{148}{}{嗯。我明白了。}
#{149}{}{I was able to make a deal with the manager. They are willing to accept your caravan as an official courier.}
{149}{}{我和经理达成了一笔交易。他们愿意接受你的商队作为官方信使。}
#{150}{}{Wow, you must have a great reputation in these parts! Thanks for the help, I would never get this job by myself. Here, have some Nuka-Cola as a gift.}
{150}{}{哇，你在这一带一定很有名气！谢谢你的帮助，我一个人永远也得不到这份工作。这里，有一些努卡可乐作为礼物。}
#{151}{}{Yeah, take care.}
{151}{}{是的，保重。}
