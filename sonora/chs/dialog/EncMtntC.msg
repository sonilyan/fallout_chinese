### {100}{}{You see Paul.}
{100}{}{你看到保罗了。}
### {101}{}{Here is a very emaciated man.}
{101}{}{这是一个非常瘦弱的人。}

### {200}{}{Man! How are you... Look, you don't belong here. Mutants won't let you live if they find you.}
{200}{}{成年男子你好吗听着，你不属于这里。如果变种人找到你，他们不会让你活着。}
### {201}{}{They left you. Who are you?}
{201}{}{他们离开了你。你是谁？}
### {202}{}{I know. So stay quiet and don't make a fuss.}
{202}{}{我知道。所以保持安静，不要大惊小怪。}

### {210}{}{You're taking a big risk.}
{210}{}{你在冒很大的风险。}
### {211}{}{If you get caught, I won't be able to help you.}
{211}{}{如果你被抓住了，我将帮不了你。}
### {212}{}{Why are you still here?}
{212}{}{你为什么还在这里？}
### {213}{}{What's on your mind?}
{213}{}{你在想什么？}
### {214}{}{You still have a chance to escape from here.}
{214}{}{你还有机会逃离这里。}
### {219}{}{See you later.}
{219}{}{回头见。}

### {220}{}{Who are you?}
{220}{}{你是谁？}
### {221}{}{My name is Paul. I follow the work of this platform.}
{221}{}{我的名字叫保罗。我关注这个平台的工作。}
### {222}{}{It's amazing. How do you know how to handle this technology?}
{222}{}{太神奇了。你怎么知道如何处理这项技术？}
### {223}{}{You're lying. No one living can control the old technologies.}
{223}{}{你在撒谎。任何活着的人都无法控制旧技术。}
### {224}{}{Well, I'm an engineer, I've been trained for this all my life.}
{224}{}{嗯，我是一名工程师，我一生都在接受这方面的培训。}
### {225}{}{Really? Where did you get your knowledge?}
{225}{}{真正地你从哪里得到的知识？}
### {226}{}{Does the name Brotherhood of Steel mean something to you? I am a knight of this ancient order. And the main task of knights is to deal with ancient technologies. However, I am an expert in energy weapons. I had to make every effort to manage the platform.}
{226}{}{钢铁兄弟会这个名字对你来说有意义吗？我是这个古老骑士团的骑士。骑士的主要任务是处理古代技术。然而，我是能源武器方面的专家。我必须尽一切努力来管理这个平台。}
### {227}{}{I have also been a member of the Brotherhood of Steel since recently. Glad to meet you, brother.}
{227}{}{从最近开始，我也是钢铁兄弟会的成员。很高兴见到你，兄弟。}
### {1227}{}{I have also been a member of the Brotherhood of Steel since recently. Nice to meet you, brother.}
{1227}{}{从最近开始，我也是钢铁兄弟会的成员。很高兴见到你，兄弟。}
### {228}{}{Okay, I'll believe you. What choice do I have? However, in the entire history of the Brotherhood, only one person from the Wasteland managed to join our ranks on common rights. And his merits were enormous.}
{228}{}{好吧，我会相信你的。我有什么选择？然而，在兄弟会的整个历史上，只有一个来自荒原的人能够加入我们的共同权利行列。他的功绩是巨大的。}

### {230}{}{How did you end up here?}
{230}{}{你是怎么来到这里的？}
### {231}{}{The super Mutants grabbed me somewhere under Necropolis. First they wanted to kill me. But then they found out that I was an engineer, and decided to leave the platform for debugging. I've been here in captivity ever since.}
{231}{}{超级变种人在墓地下面的某个地方抓住了我。起初他们想杀了我。但后来他们发现我是一名工程师，决定离开平台进行调试。从那以后，我一直被囚禁在这里。}
### {232}{}{Necropolis? Where is it?}
{232}{}{墓地？它在哪里？}
### {233}{}{It's in California. No wonder you don't know, because we are far from those places.}
{233}{}{它在加利福尼亚州。难怪你不知道，因为我们离那些地方很远。}
### {234}{}{Tell me about the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{234}{}{告诉我钢铁兄弟会。}
### {235}{}{For a long time we lived in a bunker and kept our heads down until the whole of California was under threat of conquest by super mutants. But thanks to the bravery of our brothers and sisters, the army was defeated, and its remnants are still being persecuted.}
{235}{}{很长一段时间以来，我们一直住在地堡里，一直保持低调，直到整个加利福尼亚州都面临着被超级变种人征服的威胁。但由于我们兄弟姐妹的勇敢，军队被击败了，其残余势力仍在遭受迫害。}
### {236}{}{But if you were sitting in a bunker, how did you find out about the army?}
{236}{}{但如果你坐在地堡里，你是如何发现军队的？}
### {237}{}{To be honest, the whole exploration was conducted by one stranger from the wasteland. Soon he was made an initiate. It was he who managed to sabotage the main enemy base in Mariposa. But we tell everyone that it was our order that stopped the army. And this is true, given the fierce battles that followed with the remnants of super mutants.}
{237}{}{老实说，整个探险都是由一个来自荒原的陌生人进行的。很快他就成为了一名启蒙者。正是他设法破坏了马里波萨的主要敌人基地。但我们告诉所有人，是我们的命令阻止了军队。这是真的，考虑到随之而来的超级变种人残余的激烈战斗。}
### {238}{}{I hate your Brotherhood. You are vile invaders.}
{238}{}{我讨厌你的兄弟会。你们是卑鄙的入侵者。}
### {239}{}{You are not the first and not the last person who thinks so. But in the face of a threat like super mutants or death claws, the ordinary population was powerless. The Wastelands need brotherhood, whether you like it or not.}
{239}{}{你不是第一个也不是最后一个这么认为的人。但面对超级变种人或死亡之爪这样的威胁，普通人无能为力。荒原需要兄弟情谊，不管你喜不喜欢。}

### {240}{}{Do you know where the super mutants are going?}
{240}{}{你知道超级变种人要去哪里吗？}
### {241}{}{They don't know themselves. The captain promised them that he would seize some rich district and create a super mutant state there.}
{241}{}{他们不了解自己。船长向他们承诺，他将占领一些富裕的地区，并在那里创建一个超级变异州。}
### {242}{}{Have you tried to escape from here?}
{242}{}{你有没有试图逃离这里？}
### {243}{}{I've already missed my chance. There's a desert all around, so the mutants will easily catch up with me. But even if I leave the fortress, I can hardly go back to my native Lost Hills. I don't even know where we are.}
{243}{}{我已经错过了机会。周围都是沙漠，变种人很容易就会追上我。但即使我离开堡垒，我也很难回到我的家乡Lost Hills。我甚至不知道我们在哪里。}
### {244}{}{We are in the Sonoran desert.}
{244}{}{我们在索诺兰沙漠。}
### {245}{}{That's how? Then all is not lost. As far as I know, there is an outpost in Rocky Point, they will be able to accept me there.}
{245}{}{就是这样？那么一切都不会失去。据我所知，洛基角有一个前哨基地，他们可以在那里接受我。}
### {246}{}{Then what are you waiting for?}
{246}{}{那你还在等什么？}
### {247}{}{First you need to immobilize the platform. At the lower level there is a reactor that feeds the entire system. If you disable it, the platform will not be able to move.}
{247}{}{首先你需要固定平台。在较低的水平有一个反应器，为整个系统提供原料。如果禁用它，平台将无法移动。}
### {248}{}{I'll take care of it.}
{248}{}{我会处理的。}
### {249}{}{The reactor is destroyed.}
{249}{}{反应堆被摧毁了。}

### {250}{}{The reactor stalled. It's time to get out.}
{250}{}{反应堆停了下来。是时候出去了。}
### {251}{}{As an engineer, I want to cry, looking at the destruction of such equipment. But there is no other way. It is unlikely that mutants will be able to restore the platform. And in the middle of the desert they pose no danger to anyone.}
{251}{}{作为一名工程师，看着这些设备被摧毁，我想哭。但别无选择。突变体不太可能恢复平台。在沙漠的中部，它们对任何人都没有危险。}
### {252}{}{Leaving.}
{252}{}{离开。}
### {253}{}{The main thing now is not to attract attention to yourself.}
{253}{}{现在最重要的是不要把注意力吸引到自己身上。}
### {254}{}{Leaving.}
{254}{}{离开。}
### {255}{}{You're free.}
{255}{}{你自由了。}
### {256}{}{I don't know how I'm going to get to my brothers and sisters in Rocky Point. It's time to remember everything I was taught in Lost Hills. Thank you. If I survive, I will inform the order about you.}
{256}{}{我不知道我该怎么去洛基角的兄弟姐妹那里。是时候记住我在Lost Hills学到的一切了。非常感谢。如果我活下来，我会通知命令你的情况。}
### {257}{}{Have a good trip.}
{257}{}{祝你旅途愉快。}
### {258}{}{I'm sorry, buddy, but I can't let you go. After all, you, the Brotherhood of Steel, are evil in the flesh. I will kill you, as I killed all your comrades in Puerto Penasco!}
{258}{}{对不起，伙计，我不能让你走。毕竟，你，钢铁兄弟会，在肉体上是邪恶的。我会杀了你，就像我在佩纳斯科港杀了你所有的战友一样！}
### {1258}{}{I'm sorry, buddy, but I can't let you go. After all, you, the Brotherhood of Steel, are evil in the flesh. I will kill you, as I killed all your comrades in Puerto Penasco!}
{1258}{}{对不起，伙计，我不能让你走。毕竟，你，钢铁兄弟会，在肉体上是邪恶的。我会杀了你，就像我在佩纳斯科港杀了你所有的战友一样！}
### {259}{}{All the mutants are dead. You're free.}
{259}{}{所有的变种人都死了。你自由了。}
### {260}{}{It was strong. Without mutants, this thing won't get far. And that's good. Eh, we would have soldiers like you during the Great Mutant War.}
{260}{}{它很强壮。如果没有变种人，这件事就不会走多远。这很好。呃，在大变种人战争期间，我们会有像你这样的士兵。}
### {261}{}{We're leaving.}
{261}{}{我们要走了。}
