{100}{}{Hello, you're not from around here, right? I can tell, not enough dust and grime for a miner. [She winks.] How
 can I help you?}
{101}{}{What do you got for offer?}
{102}{}{Nothing, sorry.}
{103}{}{Is this your shop?}
#your shop
{104}{}{[She laughs.] No, it belongs to the mining company. I only work here.}
{105}{}{The company store? Tell me about it.}
{106}{}{Well, let's trade then.}
#tell me about it
{107}{}{We supply the local miners with everything they need to make a living. From food to gear to everyday
 household items. We want to make sure that our employees and their families are taken care of in the best possible
 way. Otherwise people would just go up and leave and find a better life elsewhere. After all, why work for a living if
 you can't buy a living. [She laughs.] But jokes aside, we're all sitting in the same boat, right? And that means we must
 think of our community as a whole, take care of peoples' needs, create stability. That's what Larry said. In a sense the
 town is like one big family, I guess. The company even got its own legal tender [she shows you some mine script].}
{108}{}{I see.}
#
{109}{}{You again. Still not eaten by deathclaws. [She smiles.]}
{110}{}{Let me have another look at your wares.}
{111}{}{Tell me about the store again.}
{112}{}{Sorry, wrong door.}
#ore for Ron
{113}{}{Do you sell iron ore by any chance? I need 10 pieces.}
#
{114}{}{Well, this is rather unusual, but, hmm... wait a second. [She leaves the store and you idle for a while until she
 returns.] I had a word and if you really want to we could let you have 10 pieces for $1750. Is that fine with you?}
{115}{}{Yes, that's fine.}
{116}{}{Uh, that's a bit steep, I'll think it over.}
#no money
{117}{}{Insufficient funds? [She smiles.] Never mind, come back when you have it.}
{118}{}{OK.}
#
{119}{}{I changed my mind about the iron ore.}
#
{120}{}{Happy to hear it, the asking price was $1750 for 10 pieces.}
#
{121}{}{[Chance: }
{122}{}{You have failed to use your steal skill properly.}
#
{123}{}{Anything else?}
{124}{}{No, nothing.}
