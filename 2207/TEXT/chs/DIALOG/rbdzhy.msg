{1030}{999}{我只是路过。}
### {1009}{}{[you notice that G and his henchmen are wearing some kind of a uniform, made from their ragged clothes, decorated with strange insignias. The scout commander himself is waving at you with his hand-made metal staff] Chief! Nothing of significance has happened during out... Err... Damn! Always forgetting... Oh! Our shift! I mean, everything's quiet. The borders are being supervised, uncle!}
{1009}{}{[你注意到G和他的党羽穿着某种制服，由他们破旧的衣服制成，上面装饰着奇怪的徽章。侦察兵指挥官自己正在用他的手工金属杖向你挥手]酋长！外出期间没有发生任何重大事件。。。犯错误该死总是忘记。。。哦我们的轮班！我的意思是，一切都很安静。边界有人监督，叔叔！}

{1035}{999}{干得好，兄弟！坚持下去。}


### {110}{}{[he is scratching his head with both hands, driving away small insects] Don't stare at me like this! I'm trying to think here. Hmm... Do you want to work for me?}
{110}{}{[他用双手抓着头，赶走小虫子]别这样盯着我看！我试着在这里思考。嗯…你想为我工作吗？}
### {114}{}{Nah, we don't do any "jobs" - we are watchers now... You get it, keeping the Rainbow's borders under supervision. No time for petty things.}
{114}{}{不，我们不做任何“工作”――我们现在是观察者。。。你明白了，让彩虹的边界处于监督之下。没有时间做琐碎的事情。}
### {115}{}{Nah, we don't do any "jobs" now - still need to rest from the last time, to lick our wounds. I'm thinking about early retirement... Ha, just kidding! Still, we really need to rest, my fellas are tired.}
{115}{}{不，我们现在不做任何“工作”了――仍然需要从上次开始休息，舔舐伤口。我正在考虑提前退休。。。哈，开玩笑！尽管如此，我们真的需要休息，我的伙计们都累了。}
### {111}{023}{Hah! Seriously, snot? And what would you pay me with? Toys?}
{111}{023}{哈哈！说真的吗，鼻涕虫？你会用什么付钱给我？玩具？}
### {112}{012}{What are you offering?}
{112}{012}{你提供什么？}

{116}{999}{我明白了，我稍后再来。}


### {1201}{}{There is something, alright. Would be enough for all of us. I overheard this near the bar, cleaning pockets of one drunk... There are some regular caravans from NWO coming around. All we need is to raid one. The security must be pretty weak, or so they say. Well? Are you in? You look like an experienced fella, we could use your help.}
{1201}{}{有东西，好吧。对我们所有人来说都足够了。我在酒吧附近无意中听到这句话，当时我正在清理一个醉汉的口袋。。。有一些来自NWO的正规商队过来了。我们只需要突袭一个。安全性肯定很弱，或者他们是这么说的。好你在吗？你看起来像一个经验丰富的家伙，我们需要你的帮助。}
### {121}{023}{I think you are capable of raiding only local drunks! What caravan, black boy? Get out of here, don't buzz me!}
{121}{023}{我认为你只能袭击当地的酒鬼！什么大篷车，黑人男孩？滚出去，别烦我！}
### {122}{018}{I have no doubts about you, but it sounds risky... Did you think this through?}
{122}{018}{我对你毫不怀疑，但这听起来很冒险。。。你想清楚了吗？}
### {123}{017}{It suits me. Have you picked a place for an ambush?}
{123}{017}{这很适合我。你选好伏击地点了吗？}
### {124}{999}{I'll pass. The info is unverified, details are unknown... I don't do work this way. See you!}
{124}{999}{我会过去的。信息未经核实，细节未知。。。我不是这样工作的。再见}
### {1202}{}{[he winks at you with a mysterious look] Sure, brother! I overheard something recently while cleaning pockets of one drunk white boy... About the caravans from NWO. Guards are weak, much stuff to take... Get it? A good idea, don't you think? [looks at you, waiting for your approval]}
{1202}{}{[他神秘地向你眨眼]当然，兄弟！我最近在给一个喝醉的白人男孩擦口袋时无意中听到了什么。。。关于来自NWO的大篷车。警卫很弱，有很多东西要拿。。。明白了吗？一个好主意，你不觉得吗？[看着你，等待你的批准]}
### {125}{018}{Listen, G... It's cool and all, but do you understand the consequences?}
{125}{018}{听着，G…这很酷，但你明白后果吗？}
### {126}{017}{Great, little brother! Where are we going to set up our ambush? We need a good place...}
{126}{017}{太好了，小兄弟！我们要在哪里设伏？我们需要一个好地方。。。}
### {127}{999}{Let's talk about it later. I need to go now.}
{127}{999}{我们稍后再谈。我现在得走了。}


### {130}{}{[he puts arms to the sides, pulling out his hollow chest] Hey, you! Watch your mouth! [his voice gets louder] They are not my friends! They are my BROTHERS! And we are going to take over this place, just wait. What? The Hog is a tough guy, of course, but the Drop is doing him no good. He can't even sleep, did you know that? And about the rest... That freaking pimp Shepherd... [he blows his nose] He is a disgrace to all black brothers! Why does the Hog care about him? We are much better to deal with - we know everything around the Rainbow, every hole in the fence, every little path! And we have each other's backs. All I need is a little more people, and... [he looks at you, thinking]}
{130}{}{[他把胳膊放在两边，拉出他中空的胸部]嘿，你！小心你的嘴！[他的声音越来越大]他们不是我的朋友！他们是我的兄弟！我们将接管这个地方，只是等待。什么当然，猪是个硬汉，但Drop对他没有好处。他甚至睡不着，你知道吗？剩下的…那个变态的皮条客谢泼德。。。他是所有黑人兄弟的耻辱！猪为什么关心他？我们更容易对付――我们知道彩虹周围的一切，围栏上的每一个洞，每一条小路！我们互相支持。我只需要多一点人，而且。。。[他看着你，心想]}
### {131}{014}{Have something to add, G?}
{131}{014}{有什么要补充的吗，G？}


### {1401}{}{[he shakes head] Nah. Nothing.}
{1401}{}{[他摇头]不。没有什么}
### {141}{012}{Maybe you can tell me then - is there some job for me around here?}
{141}{012}{也许你可以告诉我――这附近有我的工作吗？}
### {142}{999}{See you around then.}
{142}{999}{到时见。}
### {1402}{}{Uh... I think we could accept you into our gang... If you can prove that you are useful.}
{1402}{}{嗯我想我们可以接受你加入我们的帮派。。。如果你能证明你是有用的。}
### {143}{015}{Really? I'm flattered. And what do you mean by "useful", I wonder?}
{143}{015}{真正地我受宠若惊。我想知道你所说的“有用”是什么意思？}
### {144}{012}{I think you guys are too cool for me. But I'll think about your proposal. Say - is there some job for me around here?}
{144}{012}{我觉得你们对我来说太酷了。但我会考虑一下你们的求婚。比方说，这附近有我的工作吗？}
### {145}{999}{No way. You hear all sorts of things these days... I'll come by later.}
{145}{999}{不可能。这些天你听到了各种各样的事情。。。我稍后再来。}


### {150}{}{Nothing special! Just bring us some cognac... Uh... Five bottles will be enough. You can handle it, right? You look capable.}
{150}{}{没什么特别的！给我们拿些干邑。。。嗯五瓶就足够了。你能应付的，对吧？你看起来很能干。}
### {151}{999}{That's it? Hmm... You'll never know what could come in handy later. I'll be back with the stuff.}
{151}{999}{就这样？嗯……你永远不知道以后会有什么用。我会带着东西回来的。}
### {152}{016}{Aren't you a little... underage, to get drunk? Sometimes the life is shitty, but this is definitely a bad step. Remember what you said about the Hog? The booze is just the beginning.}
{152}{016}{你不是有点。。。未成年，喝醉？有时候生活很糟糕，但这绝对是糟糕的一步。还记得你说的关于猪的事吗？喝酒只是个开始。}
### {153}{999}{Yeah, to fetch some cognac to some snots... No thank you. Not today.}
{153}{999}{是的，去拿些干邑和一些鼻涕。。。不，谢谢。今天不行。}


### {160}{}{[he chuckles] Don't lecture me, uncle. I won't do drugs, don't you worry. And the booze is okay, I can handle it. Besides, why should I care what happens in the next twenty years, when I can die at any moment from some random shit? I should have fun! Now, at this moment! And you are spoiling my fun... [he sighs] I know how to live my life without your advice. So? Would you get us some booze? If not, well do it ourselves.}
{160}{}{[他笑了笑]别教训我，叔叔。我不会吸毒的，别担心。酒也没问题，我能应付。此外，我为什么要在乎未来二十年会发生什么，当我随时可能死于一些随机的大便时？我应该玩得开心！现在，就在此刻！你破坏了我的乐趣。。。[他叹了口气]没有你的建议，我知道如何生活。所以你能给我们拿点酒吗？如果没有，我们自己做吧。}
### {161}{999}{You're right. You'll understand... Eventually. I'll bring you your cognac. Wait.}
{161}{999}{你说得对。你会明白的。。。最后我给你拿干邑。等待}
### {162}{999}{No. I won't participate in making your life more miserable.}
{162}{999}{不，我不会让你的生活更悲惨。}


### {170}{}{[he starts to draw something on the ground with a stick, marking points with little stones] Here's the plan... That's us, this is them... And this is- fuck! Who took all my stones? This is the place where we can attack them. If something goes sideways, we can easily get away through here. If we go now, we should make it to the nearest caravan.}
{170}{}{[他开始用棍子在地上画一些东西，用小石头划线]下面是计划。。。那是我们，这是他们。。。这是-操！谁拿走了我所有的石头？这是我们可以攻击他们的地方。如果有什么东西横着走，我们可以很容易地从这里逃走。如果我们现在去，我们应该去最近的商队。}
### {171}{999}{You are such a mastermind... Okay, we'll figure out the rest on the spot. Let's move.}
{171}{999}{你真是个主谋。。。好的，剩下的我们当场解决。让我们行动起来。}
### {172}{999}{No, I won't go now. If I change my mind, I'll find you.}
{172}{999}{不，我现在不去。如果我改变主意，我会找到你的。}


### {180}{}{What's there that makes you doubt? I'm telling you - the security is shit, the stuff is good! Easy-peasy...}
{180}{}{有什么让你怀疑的？我告诉你――安保很糟糕，东西很好！小菜一碟}
### {181}{019}{Security may be shit, but believe me, when you take a bullet it doesn't matter. Be honest, you are not experienced enough for this kind of stuff. Did you consider alternatives?}
{181}{019}{安全可能很糟糕，但相信我，当你挨子弹的时候，这并不重要。老实说，你对这类事情经验不足。你考虑过其他选择吗？}
### {182}{017}{Actually, you are mostly right... Let's do this!}
{182}{017}{事实上，你基本上是对的。。。让我们这样做吧！}
### {183}{999}{I won't try to change your mind. I'll come by later.}
{183}{999}{我不会试图改变你的想法。我稍后再来。}


### {190}{}{What? Alter... You mean, to do something else? What exactly? The Hog's got everything under his boot...}
{190}{}{什么改变你是说，做点别的？究竟是什么？猪什么都藏在他的靴子里。。。}
### {191}{020}{For example, you could watch over the Rainbow's borders. It's obvious that this place is not very protected from sudden invasions. The Hog obviously gets it, so if he is not doing something about it, then he is short on people. I can talk about it with him. Make you equal partners in this matter. What do you think? }
{191}{020}{例如，你可以观察彩虹的边界。很明显，这个地方没有得到很好的保护，不会受到突然入侵。猪显然明白了，所以如果他不采取措施，那么他就缺人了。我可以和他谈谈。让你们在这件事上成为平等的伙伴。你怎么看？}
### {192}{017}{Uh... Yes, you're right. Robbing caravans is more fun anyway. What was your plan?}
{192}{017}{嗯是的，你是对的。无论如何，抢劫大篷车更有趣。你的计划是什么？}
### {193}{999}{I'll get back when I think of something.}
{193}{999}{我一想到什么就回来。}


### {200}{}{Ahem... We need to discuss it... [he walks to the side, gathering his friends. They talk for some time, waving hands and shouting. Then G returns to you. He looks pleased] We're in. You can talk to the Hog. }
{200}{}{啊。。。我们需要讨论一下…[他走到一边，召集他的朋友。他们聊了一会儿，挥手喊道。然后G回到你身边。他看起来很高兴]我们进去了。你可以和猪谈谈。}
### {201}{999}{Great! You're going to grow up into a good leader. I'll go resolve this matter. See you!}
{201}{999}{太棒了你会成长为一名优秀的领导者。我去解决这件事。再见}

### {202}{}{I had a talk with the Hog about guarding the Rainbow - and he is in. He needs your services.}
{202}{}{我和猪谈过守护彩虹的事，他来了。他需要你的服务。}
### {203}{}{Yeah! YEAH! The G's gang and the Hog are PARTNERS! How's that sound? We're going to be in charge here! Gonna do things! You are so helpful, man, we will not let you down! Thanks!}
{203}{}{是 啊是的！G的帮派和猪是合作伙伴！听起来怎么样？我们将在这里负责！要做事！你太乐于助人了，伙计，我们不会让你失望的！谢谢}


### {210}{}{I knew it! I knew I wasn't mistaken in you. We are of the same kind! Let's do this again, sure, we are waiting only for you to get ready!}
{210}{}{我就知道！我知道我没有看错你。我们是同类！让我们再来一次，当然，我们只等你做好准备！}

{212}{999}{好的等一下，我需要先做点什么。}
