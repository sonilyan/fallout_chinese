{950}{}{一定地。熟练的手总是有活干的。现在我需要有人照看双头牛。这并不难。你只需要确保他们在一起，没有什么伤害他们。}
#{951}{}{That sounds simple. I'm in. [Go guard the brahmin.]}
{951}{}{听起来很简单。我加入了。[去守护双头牛。]}
#{952}{}{I'll think about it. But first, I'd like to ask you about something else.}
{952}{}{我会考虑的。但首先，我想问你一些别的事情。}
#{1000}{}{I was afraid you wouldn't ask. Our hunters have tracked a small group of geckos. They could use some help hunting them. But you have to be careful. Inexperienced hunters often get injured.}
{1000}{}{我怕你不会问。我们的猎人追踪了一小群壁虎。他们需要一些帮助来追捕他们。但你必须小心。没有经验的猎人经常受伤。}
#{1001}{}{I'll manage. [Go hunt geckos.]}
{1001}{}{我会处理的。[去猎杀壁虎。]}
#{1002}{}{I'll think about it. But first I'd like to ask you about something else.}
{1002}{}{我会考虑的。但首先我想问你一些别的事。}
#{1050}{}{Ehm, there is something, but I'm not sure it's for you... but... alright. I need someone to watch over brahmin on the pastures. It's not hard. You just have to make sure nothing harms them. You think you can handle that?}
{1050}{}{嗯，有些东西，但我不确定是给你的。。。但是。。。好吧。我需要有人看守牧场上的双头牛。这并不难。你只需要确保没有什么伤害他们。你觉得你能应付吗？}
#{1051}{}{Uhu. [Go guard the brahmin.]}
{1051}{}{嗯。[去守护双头牛。]}
#{1052}{}{No no.}
{1052}{}{不，不。}
#{1100}{}{Oh alright. Our hunters have tracked a small group of geckos, so you can join them for the hunt. But you must listen to them and take care of yourself, alright? If you're not careful, you might get hurt.}
{1100}{}{哦，好吧。我们的猎人追踪到了一小群壁虎，所以你可以加入他们一起狩猎。但你必须听他们的，照顾好自己，好吗？如果你不小心，你可能会受伤。}
#{1101}{}{Uhu. [Go hunt geckos.]}
{1101}{}{嗯。[去猎杀壁虎。]}
#{1102}{}{No no.}
{1102}{}{不，不。}
#{1150}{}{I don't have anything right now. Sorry.}
{1150}{}{我现在什么都没有。对不起的。}
#{1151}{}{Doesn't matter. Let me ask you about something else.}
{1151}{}{没关系。我再问你一件事。}
#{1152}{}{Pff.}
{1152}{}{Pff公司。}
#{1160}{}{I won't trust you with any more work.}
{1160}{}{我不会再相信你做更多的工作了。}
#{1161}{}{As you wish. Let me ask you about something else.}
{1161}{}{如你所愿。我再问你一件事。}
#{1162}{}{Pfft!}
{1162}{}{Pfft！}
#{1200}{}{You're a natural brahmin herder. Here is your reward.}
{1200}{}{你是天生的双头牛牧人。这是你的奖赏。}
#{1201}{}{You didn't do very well. But I guess it could have gone worse. Here is your reward.}
{1201}{}{你做得不太好。但我想情况可能会更糟。这是你的奖赏。}
#{1202}{}{Had I known how incompetent you were, I would never have sent you there. You can forget about any reward.}
{1202}{}{如果我知道你有多无能，我就不会派你去了。你可以忘记任何奖励。}
#{1203}{}{Had your brahmin not been so tame and dumb, it would have gone better. But forget it. I want to ask about something else.}
{1203}{}{如果你的双头牛不是那么温顺和沉默，它会变得更好。但是算了吧。我想问些别的事。}
#{1204}{}{Thaaanks! Else also...}
{1204}{}{Thaaanks！否则。。。}
#{1205}{}{Thanks. I want to ask you about something else.}
{1205}{}{谢谢。我想问你别的事。}
#{1206}{}{Eeeh. Else also...}
{1206}{}{嗯。否则。。。}
#{1250}{}{Thanks for your help with the hunt. Here's your reward.}
{1250}{}{谢谢你帮忙打猎。这是你的奖赏。}
#{1251}{}{It's terrible that we've lost one of our friends. There are already so very few of us. But I'm still grateful for your help. Here is your reward.}
{1251}{}{我们失去了一个朋友真是太可怕了。我们已经很少了。但我还是很感激你的帮助。这是你的奖赏。}
#{1252}{}{It's terrible that we've lost two of our friends. There are already so very few of us. But I'm still grateful for your help. Here is your reward.}

#{1253}{}{[Take the caps.] I want to ask you about something else.}
{1253}{}{我想问你别的事。}
#{1254}{}{Thaaanks! Else also...}
{1254}{}{Thaaanks！否则。。。}
#{1260}{}{[Helen thinks about it for a while.] We do have a surplus that others might need. And trade could really help us. So yes, I think we're interested. But can you really make it happen? As far as I know, Sedit is very far.}
{1260}{}{[海伦想了一会儿]我们确实有别人可能需要的盈余。贸易确实可以帮助我们。是的，我想我们有兴趣。但你真的能做到吗？据我所知，这很遥远。}
#{1261}{}{Even with the distance, it's still going to be beneficial. So should I let them know that you agree?}
{1261}{}{即使有距离，还是会有好处的。我应该让他们知道你同意吗？}
#{1262}{}{Distance is not a problem. You just have to pay me a small fee.}
{1262}{}{距离不是问题。你只要付我一点费用就行了。}
#{1270}{}{Thank you. We'll be expecting them.}
{1270}{}{非常感谢。我们会等他们的。}
#{1271}{}{Good. Goodbye.}
{1271}{}{很好。再见。}
#{1280}{}{I understand, nothing is free. Here are 400 caps. It's all we have left. I just hope you aren't lying.}
{1280}{}{我明白，没有什么是免费的。这儿有400顶瓶盖。我们只剩下这些了。我只希望你没有撒谎。}
#{1281}{}{You don't have to worry. Bye.}
{1281}{}{你不用担心。再见。}
#{1300}{}{I'm so glad to see you again. We are all very grateful for your mediation of the caravans deal. Their goods are very useful for our community.}
{1300}{}{很高兴再次见到你。我们都非常感谢你对商队交易的调解。他们的产品对我们社区很有用。}
#{1301}{}{Glad to help.}
{1301}{}{很乐意帮忙。}
#{1350}{}{[She looks at the symbol.] Sorry, but no.}
{1350}{}{[她看着符号]对不起，但是没有。}
#{1351}{}{That's too bad. I want to ask about something else.}
{1351}{}{那太糟糕了。我想问些别的事。}
#{1400}{}{Poor Oswald, that will be another painful blow for him. Not to mention Rachel. She will make his life a living hell now.}
{1400}{}{可怜的奥斯瓦尔德，那将是他又一次痛苦的打击。更别提瑞秋了。她会让他的生活变成地狱。}
#{1401}{}{Yeah, I guess. I want to ask you something.}
{1401}{}{是的，我想。我想问你一件事。}
#{1402}{}{Life is cruel. Goodbye.}
{1402}{}{生活是残酷的。再见。}
#{1500}{}{What exactly would you like to know?}
{1500}{}{你到底想知道什么？}
#{1501}{}{How long have you been living here?}
{1501}{}{你在这里住了多久了？}
#{1502}{}{What do you do for living around here?}
{1502}{}{你住在这儿干什么？}
#{1503}{}{What are your relations with the surrounding settlements like?}
{1503}{}{你和周围居民点的关系怎么样？}
#{1504}{}{How many people live here?}
{1504}{}{有多少人住在这里？}
#{1505}{}{Aren't you afraid of raiders?}
{1505}{}{你不怕袭击者吗？}
#{1506}{}{Actually, I want to ask about something else.}
{1506}{}{事实上，我想问些别的事。}
#{1507}{}{Never mind, nothing. Goodbye.}
{1507}{}{没关系，没什么。再见。}
#{1550}{}{Only for a few years. We're all originally from Kirtland. We left when the town started turning into one big battlefield. These days, things are so bad there that no one calls it anything other than Rat Hole. Probably because it's just the rats who manage to get by there. We didn't have any other choice but to leave that place. Here we found the best conditions for settlement, and gradually built our little community. We all hope that we'll do as well as before.}
{1550}{}{只有几年。我们都是科特兰人。当小镇开始变成一个大战场时，我们离开了。这些天，那里的情况非常糟糕，除了老鼠洞，没人管它叫什么。可能是因为只有老鼠能在那里生存。我们别无选择，只好离开那个地方。在这里，我们找到了最好的定居条件，并逐步建立了我们的小社区。我们都希望我们能做得像以前一样好。}
#{1551}{}{Rat Hole, you say? What is that place?}
{1551}{}{你说老鼠洞？那是什么地方？}
#{1552}{}{I understand. I have another question.}
{1552}{}{我理解。我还有一个问题。}
#{1553}{}{I should go. Goodbye.}
{1553}{}{我该走了。再见。}
#{1600}{}{Mainly cultivation of brahmin and crops. Sometimes we also hunt geckos. It's important that we are fully self-sufficient, since we have no one to buy things from. We managed just fine until now though. Right now we have even more than we can consume.}
{1600}{}{主要种植双头牛和农作物。有时我们也猎杀壁虎。我们必须完全自给自足，因为我们没有人可以买东西。不过，到现在为止，我们还是做得很好。现在我们拥有的比我们能消费的还要多。}

{1601}{}{你怎么处理剩余的钱？}
#{1602}{}{I see. I have another question.}
{1602}{}{我懂了。我还有一个问题。}
#{1603}{}{I should go. Goodbye.}
{1603}{}{我该走了。再见。}
#{1610}{}{Mainly cultivation of brahmin and crops. Sometimes we also hunt geckos. And now, thanks to you, we're also developing trade with caravans.}
{1610}{}{主要种植双头牛和农作物。有时我们也猎杀壁虎。现在，多亏了你们，我们也在发展与商队的贸易。}
#{1611}{}{You're welcome. I have another question.}
{1611}{}{不客气。我还有一个问题。}
#{1612}{}{I should go. Goodbye.}
{1612}{}{我该走了。再见。}
#{1650}{}{There are no towns anywhere in our surroundings. The only exception is Rat Hole, but we don't want to be involved with them in any way. So any contact is completely out of the question.}

#{1651}{}{There are no towns anywhere in our surroundings. The only exception is Rat Hole, but we don't want to be involved with them in any way. The only contact with the outside world that we have is through the caravans from Sedit, which come here thanks to you.}

#{1655}{}{And you don't mind living so far from everyone?}
{1655}{}{你不介意住得离所有人都这么远吗？}

#{1754}{}{OK. I should go now.}
{1754}{}{好 啊。我该走了。}
#{1800}{}{No, we're not afraid of raiders. We're merely a small community far from any caravan routes. The closest town is Rat Hole, which any sensible person will avoid.}

#{1850}{}{We are all used to the solitude by now. It has its pros and cons. The good thing is that we aren't bothered by any scumbags, so life is pretty peaceful here.

#{1900}{}{We have no use for what we cannot consume ourselves. That's the dark side of the isolation. But we aren't too worried about that. It would be much worse if we had to deal with a shortage.}

#{2053}{}{OK. I should go now.}
{2053}{}{好 啊。我该走了。}
#{2100}{}{All right. I left it some time ago, but I doubt that anything changed since then. Two gangs are fighting for the control over the town, which they've turned into virtually nothing but rubble. Now it's just a dirty garbage dump infested with junkies and outcasts. Any marginally reasonable person would stay clear of that place.}
{2100}{}{好吧。我不久前离开了，但我怀疑从那以后一切都变了。两个帮派正在争夺对该镇的控制权，他们把该镇变成了一片废墟。现在这里只是一个肮脏的垃圾堆，到处都是瘾君子和被遗弃的人。任何稍微通情达理的人都不会去那个地方。}
