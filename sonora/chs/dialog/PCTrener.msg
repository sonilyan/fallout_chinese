{213}{}{我的名字叫迈克。他们有时也被称为铁，因为在拳击场上没有人能打败我。但你知道吗？见鬼去吧！我厌倦了这些打架。人们只为瓶盖而战，而我则为成为最佳球员的权利而战。这不是一回事。}

{214}{}{如果你不再打架，你会怎么做？}
### {215}{}{(sips the leftovers from the bottle and sighs) I'm drinking! And I remember the old days. Seriously, it won't be difficult for me to earn extra money on "power actions". But I don't want. The city is mired in sin... Are you listening?}

### {220}{}{Yes, you're a complete loser.}

### {240}{}{Tell me about the arena.}

### {244}{}{Movies?}
{244}{}{电影？}
### {245}{}{I was lucky. At that time, the scavengers found a surviving projector and old films. Someone used them for movie shows. Then it was the only normal entertainment in the city. But the theater did not last long. The owner was killed by robbers, and the projector was taken away. I don't know what happened to all this.}
{245}{}{我很幸运。当时，拾荒者们找到了一台幸存的投影仪和一些旧电影。有人用它们来演电影。那时这是城里唯一正常的娱乐活动。但剧院并没有持续太久。店主被强盗杀害，投影仪也被拿走了。我不知道这一切发生了什么。}

### {250}{}{Ah, this is the new champion. (looks appraisingly from head to toe with the air of a connoisseur) Of course, I wouldn't let you into the ring, but Angelo still has no choice. Enjoy the victory. And get out of my room.}
{250}{}{啊，这是新的冠军。（以鉴赏家的口吻从头到脚打量着）当然，我不会让你进入拳击场，但安吉洛仍然别无选择。享受胜利。然后滚出我的房间。}

{266}{}{装瓶。当然现在，一切都被这些几年前毫无价值的嘎嘎声解决了。但如果你知道我的意思的话，我不会再出卖暴力的权利了。}
### {267}{}{Shall I tell you? (sigh) Then listen. I used to prepare everyone indiscriminately for the fight. I didn't care, as long as they paid properly. And I knew that some of my students went into street gangs or engaged in robbery, but I turned a blind eye to it... Until the tragedy happened.}
{267}{}{我告诉你好吗？（叹气）然后听。我过去常常不分青红皂白地让每个人都做好战斗的准备。我不在乎，只要他们付得合理。我知道我的一些学生加入了街头帮派或参与抢劫，但我对此视而不见……直到悲剧发生。}
### {268}{}{Go on.}
{268}{}{继续}
### {269}{}{Well, yes, as usual, they think about the consequences only at the last moment.}
{269}{}{是的，和往常一样，他们只是在最后一刻才考虑后果。}

### {272}{}{I hope you smeared them all on the asphalt?}
{272}{}{我希望你把它们都涂在沥青上了？}
### {273}{}{After the attack, they lay low and enlisted the support of gangs. I couldn't get close to them. But bandits don't live long. Now there is only one of the attackers left. He works as a security guard at a casino. If I touch him, the whole Don Diego dynasty will rise up against me. All I can do is forget myself with a bottle of tequila, which is prepared in the same casino.}
{273}{}{袭击发生后，他们低调行事，得到了黑帮的支持。我无法靠近他们。但是土匪活不了多久。现在只剩下一名攻击者了。他在一家赌场当保安。如果我碰他，整个圣地亚哥王朝都会反抗我。我所能做的就是喝一瓶龙舌兰酒，这是在同一家赌场准备的。}

{282}{}{好吧，算了。}
### {283}{}{I think you should know that he had an "accident". Are you satisfied?}
{283}{}{我想你应该知道他出了“意外”。你满意吗？}
### {284}{}{Partly. Although I don't know what I would do myself .......}
{284}{}{一定程度上虽然我不知道我自己会做什么......。}
### {285}{}{Fortunately, bandits don't live long. And I'm not going to join their ranks with new forces. All I have to do is forget myself with a bottle of tequila. I drink and don't touch anyone. It's good for everyone.}
{285}{}{幸运的是，土匪活不了多久。我不会加入他们的行列，加入新的力量。我所要做的就是喝一瓶龙舌兰酒忘记自己。我喝酒，不碰任何人。这对每个人都有好处。}

### {290}{}{Are you still against my training?}
