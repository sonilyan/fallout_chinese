### {10}{}{[the young scientist notices you approaching him - although, he looks at the Chimera, not you] Really? So, Richards managed to get me a specimen, at last? [he slowly walks to the creature, silently staring for some moments, then touches it] Oh... What an... Instrument. [he turns to you] Remind me, what's your name?}
{10}{}{[这位年轻的科学家注意到你向他靠近――尽管，他看的是奇美拉，而不是你]真的吗？所以，理查兹终于给我弄到了一个标本？[他慢慢走向这个生物，默默地盯着它看了一会儿，然后摸了摸它]哦。。。多么…乐器啊。[他转向你]提醒我，你叫什么名字？}
### {11}{}{[the young scientist notices you approaching him] I have to ask you not to interrupt me. Unfortunately, I have no time to spare for talks with soldiers. Now - I need to do my work.}
{11}{}{[年轻的科学家注意到你走近他]我不得不请你不要打断我。不幸的是，我没有时间和士兵们交谈。现在，我需要做好我的工作。}

### {13}{002}{I'm Gregorius...}
{13}{002}{我是格雷戈里乌斯。。。}
### {14}{002}{I'm Douglas, the Seeker. }
{14}{002}{我叫道格拉斯，探索者。}

### {20}{}{Oh, a Herald? From lower levels?... Tell me, what do you think of those creatures? [he nods at Chimera]}
{20}{}{哦，《先驱报》？来自下层？。。。告诉我，你觉得这些生物怎么样？[他向奇美拉点头]}
### {21}{}{A Seeker? [he looks over your armor] You must be... One of the Richards veterans, right? Do you... Hate Chimeras as much as he does?}
{21}{}{探索者？[他看了看你的盔甲]你一定是…理查兹的老兵之一，对吧？你。。。和他一样讨厌奇美拉斯？}
### {22}{003}{No, I'd say that they are interesting.}
{22}{003}{不，我想说它们很有趣。}
### {23}{004}{Actually yeah, they are disgusting. }
{23}{004}{事实上，是的，它们很恶心。}
### {24}{003}{This one is a fine exemplar for studying.}
{24}{003}{这是一个很好的学习范例。}
### {25}{004}{I'd prefer to burn any of them down. The sooner, the better.}
{25}{004}{我宁愿烧掉任何一个。越快越好。}

### {30}{}{Really? I can say that I'm surprised... Pleasantly surprised. And I'd like you to do a favor... To the science. And to the whole Olympus. And this favor directly concerns this Chimera. There's one... Nasty atavism around, which slows down our cutting-edge research. And his name is Constantine Zochkis. We have an argument about the effectiveness of different types of weapons, and he says that my methods are... Questionable, let's put it like that. I'd like to prove him wrong. Say, would you want to participate in the Olympus arms race?}
{30}{}{真正地我可以说我很惊讶。。。高兴地感到惊讶。我希望你帮个忙。。。向科学致敬。还有整个奥林匹斯山。而这个恩惠直接关系到这个奇美拉。有一个。。。令人讨厌的返祖现象，减缓了我们的前沿研究。他的名字叫康斯坦丁・佐奇基斯。我们就不同类型武器的有效性进行了争论，他说我的方法是。。。令人质疑，让我们这样说吧。我想证明他错了。你想参加奥林巴斯的军备竞赛吗？}
### {31}{005}{Sounds interesting. }
{31}{005}{听起来很有趣。}
### {32}{006}{What do I get from it?}
{32}{006}{我能从中得到什么？}

### {40}{}{Just as I suspected... Although, I'd like to ask you for a favor anyway. A favor... To the science. And to the whole Olympus. And it directly concerns this Chimera. There's one... Nasty atavism around, which slows down our cutting-edge research. And his name is Constantine Zochkis. We have an argument about the effectiveness of different types of weapons, and he says that my methods are... Questionable, let's put it like that. I'd like to prove him wrong. Say, would you want to participate in Olympus arms race??}
{40}{}{正如我所怀疑的。。。尽管如此，我还是想请你帮个忙。帮个忙。。。向科学致敬。还有整个奥林匹斯山。它直接关系到这个奇美拉。有一个。。。令人讨厌的返祖现象，减缓了我们的前沿研究。他的名字叫康斯坦丁・佐奇基斯。我们就不同类型武器的有效性进行了争论，他说我的方法是。。。令人质疑，让我们这样说吧。我想证明他错了。你想参加奥林巴斯的军备竞赛吗？？}
### {41}{005}{Sounds interesting. }
{41}{005}{听起来很有趣。}
### {42}{006}{What do I get from it?}
{42}{006}{我能从中得到什么？}

### {50}{}{Oh... Perfect! There's a way to deal with our argument with incredible elegance. Zochkis is sitting at his office, locking himself into his motorized armor suit, because he has a strong delusion of persecution - but that's not related to the case. What is, however, is that he is afraid of Chimeras, like a little girl! But at the same time, he says that Chimeras can't be used for the defense of Olympus, because they are not very effective. So, I want you to take a Chimera and to go have a talk with this old bore. Make him attack the Chimera, so we could find out what's more effective - his armor suit or claws of my new pet. Although, if he dies in the process - I wouldn't mind... And be quite pleased too.}
{50}{}{哦完美的有一种方法可以以令人难以置信的优雅处理我们的论点。佐奇基斯坐在办公室里，把自己锁在机动装甲服里，因为他有一种强烈的迫害妄想――但这与案件无关。然而，他害怕奇美拉斯，就像一个小女孩！但同时，他说Chimeras不能用于奥林巴斯的防御，因为它们不是很有效。所以，我想让你带上奇美拉，去和这个老无聊的人谈谈。让他攻击奇美拉，这样我们就可以找到更有效的东西――他的盔甲套装或我新宠物的爪子。虽然，如果他在这个过程中死亡，我不会介意。。。我也很高兴。}
### {51}{007}{I'm in. }
{51}{007}{我加入了。}
### {52}{007}{I'll think about it. If I agree, I'll come back with the results. }
{52}{007}{我会考虑的。如果我同意，我会带着结果回来的。}

### {60}{}{You? [he scratches his chin] My gratitude. I think I can... Upgrade your status in the tower. Provide you with resources. And give you access to the terminal of Zochkis. Maybe it would come in handy. [he winks]}
{60}{}{你[他挠了挠下巴]我的感激之情。我想我可以。。。升级你在塔中的状态。为您提供资源。并允许您访问Zochkis的终端。也许它会派上用场。[他眨眼]}
### {61}{007}{I'm in. }
{61}{007}{我加入了。}
### {62}{007}{I'll think about it. If I agree, I'll come back with the results. }
{62}{007}{我会考虑的。如果我同意，我会带着结果回来的。}

### {70}{}{Great! Take this keycard from the level where Constantine works. And let me know about the results. }
{70}{}{太棒了从康斯坦丁工作的地方拿走这张钥匙卡。让我知道结果。}

### {90}{}{[scientist turns to you] Hmm... Remind me, what's your name?}
{90}{}{[科学家转向你]嗯…提醒我，你叫什么名字？}
### {91}{}{Yes, of course... I'm Philipp Gray. For you, it's professor Gray. I'm sure, Richards already told you about my request for... Obtaining a certain sample of Radius fauna. And I don't see the sample, so I have to ask you not to waste my time any longer.}
{91}{}{是的，当然。。。我是菲利普・格雷。对你来说，是格雷教授。我确信，理查兹已经告诉你我的请求。。。获取Radius动物群的特定样本。我没有看到样品，所以我不得不请你不要再浪费我的时间了。}
### {92}{999}{[leave silently]}
{92}{999}{[默默地离开]}
### {93}{092}{Professor, does the words "Dick", "promise" and "some plans" mean anything to you?}
{93}{092}{教授，“迪克”、“承诺”和“一些计划”这些词对你来说有意义吗？}
### {94}{}{Oh, a good old man Dick... Did he decide to resort to blackmailing? Silly, he has nothing on me, only empty words. But still - a promise is a promise. I gave my word. Besides, it's a good chance to test the cloning machine after recalibration. So, please, go to the upper level - you can use the ladder at the opposite side of this floor - find dr. Moreau and give him the power cell. He knows what to do.}
{94}{}{哦，一个好老头迪克。。。他决定采取勒索手段了吗？愚蠢的是，他对我什么都没有，只有空话。但是，承诺就是承诺。我保证了。此外，这是一个很好的机会，在重新校准后测试克隆机。所以，请到上层去――你可以用这层楼对面的梯子――找到莫罗医生，把电池给他。他知道该怎么做。}
### {95}{093}{Cloning machine?}
{95}{093}{克隆机器？}
### {96}{999}{Okay, I'll go visit this Moreau.}
{96}{999}{好的，我去参观这个莫罗。}
### {97}{}{Yes, a great legacy of the past. We used these devices some time ago, to control the Tartarus population level when we had a... "Bad harvest" of Servants, let's put it like this. Well, now we are more often presented with an opposite problem, but cloning machines are still being used sometimes - as in now. Don't waste any more time and go to Moreau.}
{97}{}{是的，这是过去的伟大遗产。我们前段时间使用这些设备来控制鞑靼人的人口水平，当时我们有……仆人的“坏收成”，让我们这样说吧。好吧，现在我们经常面临相反的问题，但克隆机有时仍在使用――就像现在一样。别再浪费时间了，去莫罗吧。}

### {100}{}{I see you came back. Is there something important?}
{100}{}{我看到你回来了。有什么重要的事情吗？}
### {101}{}{Here comes our supporter of the right development of the Olympus defense... Do you have something for me?}
{101}{}{我们支持奥林巴斯防务的正确发展。。。你有什么给我的吗？}
### {105}{}{I don't know what you did, and I don't want to know, but this stupid Kelly doesn't bother me anymore. Thanks. Did you want something?}
{105}{}{我不知道你做了什么，我也不想知道，但这个愚蠢的凯利不再打扰我了。谢谢你想要什么吗？}
### {102}{012}{Yes. I have some news. And you're going to like it.}
{102}{012}{对我有一些消息。你会喜欢的。}
### {103}{011}{No.}
{103}{011}{不}

{110}{}{那我们现在就没什么好说的了。}

{111}{999}{[对话结束]}

### {120}{}{Great! I'm not interested in details... I'm more interested in the results. And I need to study the results. And your result is a blocked keycard. The password to the terminal panel at Zochkis' room is 2358, as for the keycard - you can unlock it using his calculator on the Engineering floor. It's the closest to his office. Just put the card in. If... When my time comes - I'll reward you properly. And now I have some business to attend.}
{120}{}{太棒了我对细节不感兴趣。。。我对结果更感兴趣。我需要研究结果。你的结果是一个被阻止的钥匙卡。Zochkis房间终端面板的密码是2358，至于钥匙卡，你可以用他在工程楼层的计算器解锁。它离他的办公室最近。把卡片放进去。如果……我的时间到了，我会好好奖励你的。现在我有一些事情要处理。}
