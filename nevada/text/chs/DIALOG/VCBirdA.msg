#{100}{}{You see Andy Hawk.}
{100}{}{你看到安迪・霍克了。}
#{101}{}{You see Randy Hawk.}
{101}{}{你看到兰迪・霍克了。}
#{102}{}{You see a tired shabby caravan merchant. Apparently, his last journey was rough.}
{102}{}{你看到一个破旧的商队商人。显然，他的最后一次旅行很艰难。}
#{105}{}{Hello, friend! We were just talking about you!}
{105}{}{你好，朋友！我们只是在谈论你！}
#{106}{}{Ah, wanderer, hello. How are you doing? As you can see, we don??t do so well.}
{106}{}{啊，流浪汉，你好。你好吗？如你所见，我们做得不太好。}
#{107}{}{What do you want?}
{107}{}{你想要什么？}
#{149}{}{You will have to tell me. I??m not one of those that can be easily pushed away.}
{149}{}{你得告诉我。我不是那种容易被推开的人。}
#{150}{}{I just wanted to say hi.}
{150}{}{我只是想打个招呼。}
#{151}{}{Nothing.}
{151}{}{没有什么。}
#{152}{}{What happened to your group?}
{152}{}{你的团队怎么了？}
#{153}{}{We had a shitty journey, that??s what. 20 miles from the Wind of War we have reached the gas station and stopped to rest. It was at night, and we were ambushed by that raiders scum. We barely made it out alive, but all the goods were left there.}
{153}{}{我们的旅程糟透了，就是这样。我们已经到了离战风20英里的加油站，停下来休息。那是在晚上，我们被那个强盗的人渣伏击了。我们勉强活着出来，但所有的货物都留在那里了。}
#{154}{}{The goods, you say, huh? Heh-heh. Perhaps, you can show me, where's this place?}
{154}{}{你说是货物吧？嘿嘿。也许，你可以告诉我，这地方在哪里？}
#{155}{}{Did everyone made it out alive?}
{155}{}{所有人都活着出来了吗？}
#{156}{}{Well, tough luck. Bye.}
{156}{}{好吧，真倒霉。再见。}
#{157}{}{What?! Oh, you bastard! We lost half of our men, and all you think about is looting the goods? Like hell I'll show you the location!!!}
{157}{}{什么？！哦，你这个混蛋！我们损失了一半的人，而你只想着抢劫？见鬼，我会告诉你地点！！！}
#{158}{}{[Grab him by the collar] Where is the merchandise?! Where?!}
{158}{}{[抓住他的衣领]商品在哪里？！哪里？！}
#{159}{}{Damn, okay. I will find it out anyway!}
{159}{}{该死，好吧。反正我会查出来的！}
#{160}{}{Wow, sorry, it??s just my goddamn greed.}
{160}{}{哇，对不起，这只是我他妈的贪婪。}
#{161}{}{Ah, shit! Okay, fuck it, I'll show you, but keep in mind - if you get killed, it??s not my fault! Got it?! Although, you know... Listen, yeah, seriously, go there, okay? If you see some of our guys from "Speed Hawk" made it out alive, tell them that four of us got to Vegas... But I really doubt that anyone left there, except dead bodies... Goddamn raiders! May they burn in hell!}
{161}{}{啊，该死！好吧，去他妈的，我给你看，但要记住-如果你被杀了，那不是我的错！知道了？！虽然，你知道...听着，是的，说真的，去那里，好吗？如果你看到“速度鹰”的人活着出来，告诉他们我们四个人到了维加斯...但我真的很怀疑除了尸体以外还有人留在那里...该死的袭击者！愿他们在地狱里燃烧！}
#{162}{}{Come on already, give me the coordinates!}
{162}{}{快点，把坐标给我！}
#{163}{}{The location of the attack by raiders on the caravan have been marked on your Pip-Boy.}
{163}{}{袭击者袭击商队的地点已经标记在你的皮普小子身上。}
#{164}{}{What Wind of War?}
{164}{}{什么战风？}
#{165}{}{Lush place between Reno and Vegas. Most caravans stop there to rest and get some water.}
{165}{}{里诺和维加斯之间的一个郁郁葱葱的地方。大多数商队都会停在那里休息，喝点水。}
#{166}{}{Can you show me the location on the map?}
{166}{}{你能告诉我地图上的位置吗？}
#{167}{}{Yes, here [He enters the coordinates into your Pip-Boy]. But be careful there, don??t talk to soldiers, it's better sometimes to avoid them altogether.}
{167}{}{是的，在这里[他把坐标输入你的小男孩]。但在那里要小心，不要和士兵说话，有时最好完全避开他们。}
#{168}{}{Okay. Thanks.}
{168}{}{可以。谢谢。}
#{169}{}{So, you are saying you abandoned the goods? Perhaps, you can show me where this place is?}
{169}{}{那么，你是说你放弃了货物？也许，你能告诉我这个地方在哪里？}
#{170}{}{What about your problem? Did everyone made it out alive?}
{170}{}{你的问题呢？所有人都活着出来了吗？}
#{171}{}{Thank you, wanderer, for being so sympathetic. Others would want to know where we left the goods instead... But when we were running away it was dark, and I don??t even know who may be alive. I??m afraid that only four of us survived.}
{171}{}{谢谢你，流浪汉，你这么有同情心。其他人会想知道我们把货物放在哪里了...但是当我们逃跑的时候天已经黑了，我甚至不知道谁还活着。恐怕我们只有四个人活了下来。}
#{172}{}{How many people were in your group?}
{172}{}{你们组有多少人？}
#{173}{}{Sorry. We'll talk about it later.}
{173}{}{对不起的。我们稍后再谈。}
#{174}{}{Eight. Raiders did everything smart and we didn??t even heard them coming. I didn??t even think, they can be so cunning. Usually raiders just attack head-on. And here we had a good planned assault...}
{174}{}{八个。突袭者做的每件事都很聪明，我们甚至没有听到他们来。我甚至没想到，他们会这么狡猾。通常突袭者只是正面攻击。我们计划好了进攻...}
#{175}{}{So you just abandoned everything and started running? And didn??t even think of coming back?}
{175}{}{所以你放弃了一切开始跑步？甚至没想过回来？}
#{176}{}{Yes, damn it! It's raiders, no one wants to deal with them. They cannot be negotiated with. Just look what they did to my guys. [points at those, who is laying on mattresses] The fact that we made it to Vegas was a miracle by itself.}
{176}{}{是的，该死！是袭击者，没人想对付他们。不能与他们谈判。看看他们对我的人做了什么。[指着那些躺在床垫上的人]我们到了维加斯本身就是个奇迹。}
#{177}{}{Right. Maybe, you need help?}
{177}{}{正确的。也许，你需要帮助？}
#{178}{}{Sad story. But I have to go.}
{178}{}{悲惨的故事。但我得走了。}
#{179}{}{So, you are saying you abandoned the goods? Heh-heh. Maybe you can show me the location?}
{179}{}{那么，你是说你放弃了货物？嘿嘿。也许你能告诉我地点？}
#{180}{}{Are you saying that you'll just go there? Damn you must be desperate. Fine, wanderer, let me show you the place.}
{180}{}{你是说你就去那里？你一定是走投无路了。好吧，流浪汉，我带你去看看。}
#{181}{}{Show me.}
{181}{}{向我展示。}
#{182}{}{Here. Raiders already took everything valuable for sure. But probably they left some things they didn??t care about. There is a filter there. Useful thingy. Return it, okay? And you can take everything else.}
{182}{}{在这里。袭击者已经把所有有价值的东西都拿走了。但也许他们留下了一些他们不在乎的东西。那里有个过滤器。有用的东西。把它还给我，好吗？你可以拿走其他的一切。}
#{183}{}{We'll see.}
{183}{}{我们拭目以待。}
#{184}{}{And one more thing. If you see any of our guys, tell them, that we have made it to Vegas. And if they are dead, then... Please, don??t let them rot under the sun, bury them like human beings, okay? There was a shovel in one of the wagons, I don??t think raiders would take it.}
{184}{}{还有一件事。如果你看到我们的人，告诉他们，我们已经到了维加斯。如果他们死了，那么...拜托，别让他们在阳光下腐烂，像人一样埋葬他们，好吗？其中一辆马车里有一把铲子，我想袭击者不会拿走的。}
#{185}{}{I'll see what I can do.}
{185}{}{我看看我能做什么。}
#{186}{}{About the raid. Are you sure it was raiders?}
{186}{}{关于突袭。你确定是袭击者吗？}
#{187}{}{Who else?! But if I think about how they ambushed us... Damn, sneaky bastards!}
{187}{}{还有谁？！但如果我想想他们是怎么伏击我们的...该死的，鬼鬼祟祟的混蛋！}
#{188}{}{Hmm...}
{188}{}{Hmm...}
#{189}{}{I know who did this. It wasn??t raiders, it was soldiers from the Wind of War.}
{189}{}{我知道是谁干的。这不是袭击者，而是来自战争之风的士兵。}
#{190}{}{Are you sure? We knew it. They worked too professional! Fine, forget it then. This is getting way more dangerous.}
{190}{}{你确定？我们就知道。他们工作太专业了！好吧，那就算了。这越来越危险了。}
#{191}{}{Well, we'll see about that.}
{191}{}{好吧，我们拭目以待。}
#{192}{}{Your problem is solved. Turns out, the attack was done by the Wind of War soldiers.}
{192}{}{你的问题解决了。原来，这次袭击是士兵们的阵风造成的。}
#{193}{}{So that??s how it is! We knew it. They worked too professional... But how did you managed to find out? What about our merchandise?}
{193}{}{所以这就是事实！我们就知道。他们工作太专业了...但你是怎么发现的？我们的商品呢？}
#{194}{}{The goods are still at a gas station. You can go take it, but most valuables are long gone.}
{194}{}{货物还在加油站。你可以去拿，但大部分贵重物品早就不见了。}
#{195}{}{Damn... I knew it. Hopeless.}
{195}{}{该死...我就知道。绝望的。}
#{196}{}{Not quite. During my investigation I managed to find the ones that did the attack.}
{196}{}{不完全是。在我的调查中，我设法找到了袭击者。}
#{197}{}{Not quite. The Wind of War got what it deserved.}
{197}{}{不完全是。战争之风罪有应得。}
#{198}{}{Well, it??s too soon to tell... Let me check a few more things and I??ll be back.}
{198}{}{好吧，现在说还为时过早...让我再检查几件东西，我会回来的。}
#{199}{}{[Opens his eyes in surprise] How did that happen?}
{199}{}{[惊讶地睁开眼睛]怎么会这样？}
#{200}{}{[Tell the details]}
{200}{}{[说出细节]}
#{201}{}{[Sighs] It won??t bring our guys back. What about the stolen goods?}
{201}{}{[叹息]这不会让我们的人回来的。那赃物呢？}
#{202}{}{I managed to return only the money - $1500 bucks.}
{202}{}{我设法只还了钱――1500美元。}
#{203}{}{I managed to get the filter.}
{203}{}{我设法弄到了过滤器。}
#{204}{}{I managed to get the money and the filter - $1500.}
{204}{}{我设法拿到了钱和过滤器――1500美元。}
#{205}{}{Sorry, everything is lost.}
{205}{}{对不起，一切都丢了。}
#{206}{}{[Opens his eyes in surprise] I see, they respect you there, since you??re still alive. What did you manage to find out?}
{206}{}{我明白了，他们尊重你，因为你还活着。你发现了什么？}
#{207}{}{Curse to them! You know, I don??t care about the goods. The most important thing we carried is a cleaning filter for Salt Lake City. People there are waiting for it, like the second coming of Jesus. Damn my luck... Fine, thank you for at least learning the truth. We won??t ever come through the Wind of War again. We will change our route.}
{207}{}{诅咒他们！你知道，我不在乎货物。我们携带的最重要的东西是盐湖城的清洁过滤器。那里的人都在等待，就像耶稣的第二次降临。真倒霉...好吧，谢谢你至少知道了真相。我们再也不会经历战争之风了。我们要改变路线。}
#{208}{}{Well, I gotta go, erm, there is a thing I must attend to... In another city. Take care!}
{208}{}{好吧，我得走了，呃，有件事我必须处理...在另一个城市。当心！}
#{209}{}{Thank you so much! You??re a good person, since you didn??t abandon us. Let me share the money with you? [gives 750 dollars] You earned it.}
{209}{}{非常感谢！你是个好人，因为你没有抛弃我们。让我把钱分给你？[给出750美元]这是你应得的。}
#{210}{}{What will you do now?}
{210}{}{你现在要做什么？}
#{211}{}{We won??t come to Wind of War again. And probably will change our route. You know, I don??t care about the goods as much. The most important thing we carried is a cleaning filter for Salt Lake City. People there are waiting for it like the second coming of Jesus. Damn my luck...}
{211}{}{我们不会再有战争之风了。可能会改变我们的路线。你知道，我不太在乎货物。我们携带的最重要的东西是盐湖城的清洁过滤器。那里的人都在等待，就像耶稣的第二次降临。真倒霉...}
#{212}{}{Right. Well, take care of yourself now.}
{212}{}{正确的。好吧，现在照顾好你自己。}
#{213}{}{Yes, it was the most important! Salt Lake City is waiting for it, like the second coming of Jesus. It is needed to start the artesian tower pump and supply people with clean water. It??s just - I don??t know how we'll be able to take this thing to the city in our current state...}
{213}{}{是的，这是最重要的！盐湖城正在等待它，就像耶稣的第二次降临。需要启动自流塔泵，为人们提供干净的水。只是-我不知道在我们现在的状态下，我们怎么能把这个东西带到城里去...}
#{214}{}{I can do it. Who must I give the filter to?}
{214}{}{我能做到。我必须把过滤器给谁？}
#{215}{}{Uhh... You??re right. We won??t be able to take it there. Not just because of our condition. You see, how the other is looking at us? I??m sure some of them already know what we are talking about, we won??t make it out of the city. But you have the chance. Take it. We wanted to sell it to the Nuka-Cola factory, but you certainly will judge better to whom it is more necessary.}
{215}{}{呃...你说得对。我们不能把它带到那里去。不仅仅是因为我们的状况。你看，对方怎么看我们？我相信他们中的一些人已经知道我们在说什么，我们不会离开这个城市的。但你有机会。拿去吧。我们想把它卖给努卡可乐厂，但你肯定会更好地判断谁更需要它。}
#{216}{}{You??re right! Well, I have to go. Good luck to you.}
{216}{}{你说得对！我得走了。祝你好运。}
#{217}{}{Amazing! I was getting desperate... But, thanks to you, we now have money to rest and gather our strength. Now about the other problem. Filter - that's the most important thing we carried. Salt Lake City is waiting for it, like the second coming of Jesus. It is needed, to start the artesian water pump and supply people with clean water. I don??t know how we'll be able to take this thing to the city in our current state...}
{217}{}{太神了！我快绝望了...但是，多亏了你，我们现在有钱休息，积蓄力量。关于另一个问题。过滤器-这是我们携带的最重要的东西。盐湖城正在等待它，就像耶稣的第二次降临。需要启动自流水泵，为人们提供干净的水。我不知道在我们现在的状态下，我们怎么能把这个东西带到城里去...}
#{218}{}{Wait! The journey to Salt Lake is long... Here, take this. It was made specifically for the desert conditions. Take it, take it, I insist!}
{218}{}{等待！去盐湖的路程很长...给，拿着这个。它是专门为沙漠环境设计的。拿着，拿着，我坚持！}
#{219}{}{Thank you.}
{219}{}{非常感谢。}
#{242}{}{I found a survivor. Sadly, only one...}
{242}{}{我找到一个幸存者。可悲的是，只有一个...}
#{243}{}{Then the others died? [sighs] I knew it. Thank you, for finding Bibbit. We'll wait for him here, he'll surely will come with some caravan from the Wind of War.}
{243}{}{其他人死了？我就知道。谢谢你找到毕比。我们在这里等他，他一定会带着战风中的商队来的。}
#{244}{}{You??re welcome.}
{244}{}{不客气。}
#{245}{}{Sorry, we have nothing to pay you. We are broke after the raid.}
{245}{}{对不起，我们没有钱给你。突袭之后我们破产了。}
#{246}{}{Forget it, friend, I'll manage without rewards.}
{246}{}{算了吧，朋友，我不给报酬也行。}
#{247}{}{Then why did I do all that!?}
{247}{}{那我为什么要这么做！？}
#{248}{}{It??s done. Old friends are reunited, thanks to you.}
{248}{}{一切都结束了。多亏了你，老朋友们团聚了。}
#{249}{}{Oh, friend, I would make you rich, if I had something, you know?! We are starving ourselves. We have nothing, please understand!}
{249}{}{哦，朋友，我会让你发财的，如果我有什么，你知道吗？！我们正在挨饿。我们什么都没有，请理解！}
#{250}{}{Fuck you!!!}
{250}{}{去你妈的！！！}
#{251}{}{Shit, fine, never mind.}
{251}{}{妈的，好吧，没关系。}
#{252}{}{But wait! [puts out something shiny] I don??t know, perhaps, you'll need it. Because I don??t.}
{252}{}{但是等等！我不知道，也许你会需要它。因为我没有。}
#{253}{}{Lighter? Useful, thanks.}
{253}{}{打火机？有用，谢谢。}
#{254}{}{Wow! Shiny toy!}
{254}{}{哇！闪亮的玩具！}
#{255}{}{Were you driving caravans between Vegas and Reno? have you seen a military base, called Area 51?}
{255}{}{你在拉斯维加斯和雷诺之间开大篷车吗？你见过一个叫51区的军事基地吗？}
#{256}{}{Erm... No, uhh... I haven??t.}
{256}{}{呃...不，呃...我没有。}
#{257}{}{Damn, too bad.}
{257}{}{该死，太糟糕了。}
#{258}{}{Erm... No, uhh... I haven??t. And I??m glad I didn??t. Especially after that story at the Wind of War.}
{258}{}{呃...不，呃...我没有。我很高兴我没有。尤其是在战争之风的故事之后。}
#{259}{}{Glad? Why is that?}
{259}{}{高兴吗？为什么？}
#{260}{}{Well, I honestly never been there, but more experienced caravaneers know about it and steer clear away.}
{260}{}{嗯，老实说，我从来没有去过那里，但更有经验的商队知道这一点，并避开。}
#{261}{}{Is it so dangerous?}
{261}{}{有那么危险吗？}
#{262}{}{It??s a hellish place. Those, those who seek their fortune of ancient technologies and super weapons there - never come back.}
{262}{}{那是个地狱般的地方。那些在那里寻求古代科技和超级武器财富的人永远不会回来。}
#{263}{}{Interesting...}
{263}{}{有趣...}
#{264}{}{They say there is a nest of horrid creatures there, that sometimes attack caravans. Luckily, they rarely go so far. I never seen one, but, by descriptions it??s a nightmare, trust me.}
{264}{}{他们说那里有一窝可怕的生物，有时会袭击商队。幸运的是，他们很少走这么远。我从来没见过，但是，根据描述这是一场噩梦，相信我。}
#{265}{}{If you say so.}
{265}{}{如果你这样说。}
#{266}{}{I??m serious! Instead of hands they have four tentacles, they grab the prey and rip it apart [actively gesticulating with hands]. Damn! Huge beasts, three times bigger than man! They say they hunt only on night. And that they have no eyes, but they can see through darkness.}
{266}{}{我是认真的！它们没有手，而是有四个触角，它们抓住猎物并撕开它[积极地用手做手势]。该死！巨大的野兽，比人类大三倍！他们说他们只在晚上打猎。他们没有眼睛，却能透过黑暗看见。}
#{267}{}{Dangerous and cunning foe. But that??s okay - I??ll find a way to deal with that beasts. Where is the nest, you say?}
{267}{}{危险狡猾的敌人。但没关系-我会想办法对付那些野兽的。你说，鸟巢在哪里？}
#{268}{}{Area 51. 80 miles from Vegas. Let me show you the approximate location. [points into your Pip-Boy some coordinates]}
{268}{}{51区。离维加斯80英里。让我告诉你大概的位置。[指向你的皮普男孩一些坐标]}
#{269}{}{Thanks, friend, that??s what I needed.}
{269}{}{谢谢，朋友，这正是我所需要的。}
#{270}{}{Remember what I told you! Even though I never met them, I knew those, who wasn??t that lucky. I showed you the place so you can avoid it. Stay away from that valley, okay?}
{270}{}{记住我告诉你的！尽管我从未见过他们，但我认识那些不那么幸运的人。我给你看了那个地方，你可以避开它。离那个山谷远点，好吗？}
#{271}{}{We'll see.}
{271}{}{我们拭目以待。}
#{272}{}{Okay.}
{272}{}{可以。}
#{273}{}{No! No way! Tell me you won??t go there! I don??t want people like you get hurt.}
{273}{}{不！不可能！告诉我你不会去那里！我不想让你这样的人受伤。}
#{274}{}{Okay-okay, nothing will happen to me. You better watch over you and your guys.}
{274}{}{好吧，我不会出事的。你最好小心你和你的人。}
#{300}{}{Told ya! We should not walk at daytime!}
{300}{}{告诉你了！我们不应该在白天散步！}
#{301}{}{Now the "Speed Hawk" has its wings cut. Shame.}
{301}{}{现在“速度鹰”的翅膀被切断了。羞愧。}
#{302}{}{What kind of a caravaneers are we now?!}
{302}{}{我们现在是什么样的商队？！}
#{303}{}{Dammit! We always get in some trouble!}
{303}{}{该死！我们总是遇到麻烦！}
#{304}{}{We are the most unlucky caravan in the world.}
{304}{}{我们是世界上最倒霉的商队。}
#{305}{}{Why didn??t you listen to me!}
{305}{}{你为什么不听我的！}
#{306}{}{I told ya, we should've walked to the north!}
{306}{}{我告诉过你，我们应该走到北方去！}
#{307}{}{Let this be a lesson for you!}
{307}{}{让这成为你的教训！}
#{308}{}{You don??t listen to me again, do you?}
{308}{}{你再也不听我的了，是吗？}
#{309}{}{No, we should only make stops in abandoned places!}
{309}{}{不，我们只能在废弃的地方停车！}
#{310}{}{We must go back and take the goods!}
{310}{}{我们必须回去拿货！}
#{311}{}{I insist! We must go back!}
{311}{}{我坚持！我们必须回去！}
#{312}{}{They already left, they won??t be waiting for us there!}
{312}{}{他们已经走了，他们不会在那里等我们的！}
#{313}{}{They are already got drunk on Rot Gut and forgot about us!}
{313}{}{他们已经喝醉了，忘了我们！}
#{314}{}{"Speed Hawk"! Get yourself together!}
{314}{}{“速度鹰”！振作起来！}
#{315}{}{Everything will be alright, don??t worry!}
{315}{}{一切都会好起来的，别担心！}
#{316}{}{I can feel it - something is not right.}
{316}{}{我能感觉到-有些不对劲。}
#{317}{}{All of this is very suspicious...}
{317}{}{所有这些都很可疑...}
#{318}{}{I think we have been set up.}
{318}{}{我想我们被陷害了。}
#{319}{}{How did they know? Did they follow us?}
{319}{}{他们怎么知道的？他们跟踪我们了吗？}
#{320}{}{Hmm... I don??t know. All of this is strange.}
{320}{}{Hmm...我不知道。这一切都很奇怪。}
#{350}{}{Maybe you have met... Hmm... Any *dangerous* caravans that should be avoided?}
{350}{}{也许你见过...Hmm...有什么危险的商队应该避免吗？}
#{351}{}{I don??t know. And I don??t want to know.}
{351}{}{我不知道。我不想知道。}
#{352}{}{Tell me, you son of a bitch!!! Or I will *make* you speak!!!}
{352}{}{告诉我，你这狗娘养的！！！否则我会让你说话！！！}
#{353}{}{Right.}
{353}{}{正确的。}
#{354}{}{Why do I get all of this! Raiders, junkies, you! No life for honest worker! Ahem... [lowers his voice] Listen, we call them "Black Caravan". It's a few guys, rather quiet. They make a stop at a backyard behind this building, push the product to someone and silently leave at night. That is all I know, so leave me alone.}
{354}{}{为什么我要得到这些！袭击者，瘾君子，你！诚实的工人没有生命！啊哼...听着，我们叫他们“黑商队”。有几个人，很安静。他们在这栋楼后面的后院停下来，把产品推给某人，然后在晚上悄悄离开。我只知道这些，所以别管我。}
#{355}{}{That's better! Instead of "don??t know", "don??t wanna know", blah-blah-blah...}
{355}{}{这样更好！而不是“不知道”，“不想知道”，诸如此类...}
#{356}{}{Why do you need them for?! Ugh, fine, it??s your business. But we don??t deal with them. I only know that they make a stop behind this building, push the product to someone and leave. We call them "Black Caravan". I don??t know anything else about them, we don??t have business with such kind...}
{356}{}{你为什么需要它们？！呃，好吧，这是你的事。但我们不跟他们打交道。我只知道他们在这栋楼后面停下来，把产品推给别人然后离开。我们称之为“黑商队”。我对他们一无所知，我们和这种人没有生意往来...}
#{357}{}{Right.}
{357}{}{正确的。}
#{1105}{}{Hello, sis! We were just talking about you!}
{1105}{}{你好，姐姐！我们只是在谈论你！}
#{1106}{}{Ah, wanderer, hello. How are you doing? As you can see, we don??t do so well.}
{1106}{}{啊，流浪汉，你好。你好吗？如你所见，我们做得不太好。}
#{1150}{}{I just wanted to say hi.}
{1150}{}{我只是想打个招呼。}
#{1157}{}{What?! Oh, you bitch! We lost half of our men, and all you think about is looting the goods? Like hell I'll show you the location!!!}
{1157}{}{什么？！哦，你这个婊子！我们损失了一半的人，而你只想着抢劫？见鬼，我会告诉你地点！！！}
#{1171}{}{Thank you, wanderer, for being so sympathetic. Others would want to know where we left the goods instead... But when we were running away, it was dark and I don??t even know, who may be alive. I??m afraid only four of us survived.}
{1171}{}{谢谢你，流浪汉，你这么有同情心。其他人会想知道我们把货物放在哪里了...但是当我们逃跑的时候，天已经黑了，我甚至不知道谁还活着。恐怕我们只有四个人活了下来。}
#{1180}{}{Are you saying that you'll just go there? Damn you must be desperate. Fine, wanderer, let me show you the place.}
