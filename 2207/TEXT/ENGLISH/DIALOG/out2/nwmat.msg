### {92}{011}{What did he do to you?}
{92}{011}{他对你做了什么？ -- What did he do to you?}


### {110}{}{It's more about what he didn't do. Seth never acted like a brother, never complimented me on anything. Not one time. Never gave me support when I really needed it. All he could do is to demand listening to him and do what he says. When I tried to talk to him about what I want to do in life, he just made fun of me, telling me I won't be able to accomplish anything. So, that was the end for us.}
{110}{}{更多的是关于他没有做什么。赛斯从来没有表现得像个兄弟，从来没有在任何事情上称赞过我。一次也没有。当我真正需要的时候，他从来没有给过我支持。他所能做的就是要求听他的话，照他的话做。当我试图和他谈谈我想在生活中做什么时，他只是取笑我，告诉我我什么都做不了。所以，这就是我们的结局。 -- It's more about what he didn't do. Seth never acted like a brother, never complimented me on anything. Not one time. Never gave me support when I really needed it. All he could do is to demand listening to him and do what he says.

{111}{012}{也许那是他照顾你的方式。让你远离麻烦。 -- Maybe that was his way of taking care of you. To keep you out of trouble.}
### {112}{014}{Looks like he failed as a brother. But does it mean you have to be angry at him?}
{112}{014}{看起来他作为兄弟失败了。但这是否意味着你必须对他生气？ -- Looks like he failed as a brother. But does it mean you have to be angry at him?}
### {113}{015}{You're being a real jerk. Set was wrong only in one thing - not beating you up enough.}
{113}{015}{你真是个混蛋。Set只在一件事上错了――打你还不够。 -- You're being a real jerk. Set was wrong only in one thing - not beating you up enough.}


### {120}{}{That's bullshit! He tried to make me look like a wimp, unable to live without him. He just wanted to feel his superiority. But what did he actually achieve in life? So much ambition with no results. A king of his tent. A president of a toilet.}
{120}{}{那是胡说八道！他试图让我看起来像个窝囊废，没有他就活不下去。他只是想感受一下自己的优越感。但他在生活中到底取得了什么成就？野心太大却没有结果。他帐篷里的国王。厕所的总裁。 -- That's bullshit! He tried to make me look like a wimp, unable to live without him. He just wanted to feel his superiority. But what did he actually achieve in life? So much ambition with no results. A king of his tent. A president of a toilet.}

### {131}{}{Yeah, well, that's all in the past now. I can finally leave this behind.}
{131}{}{是的，好吧，这都是过去的事了。我终于可以把这件事抛在脑后了。 -- Yeah, well, that's all in the past now. I can finally leave this behind.}

### {133}{999}{See you.}
{133}{999}{再见 -- See you.}


### {140}{}{Sometimes I try to forgive him because I understand how he feels. After our parents died, we were captured by the slavers and sold to the Sunset Jackals. This was hell, especially for Seth. Every new day was making him angrier for everything he had to endure. So, that was our childhood. Then the camp we were held in was destroyed by some warriors wearing strange shiny suits of armor. But Seth was already full of hate by that point, so, I guess now he wants to have revenge on the world, or something similar.}
{140}{}{有时我试图原谅他，因为我理解他的感受。父母死后，我们被奴隶贩子抓走，卖给了日落豺狼。这真是地狱，尤其是对赛斯来说。每一个新的日子都让他对所要忍受的一切更加愤怒。那就是我们的童年。然后，我们被关押的营地被一些穿着奇怪闪亮盔甲的战士摧毁了。但赛斯那时已经充满了仇恨，所以，我想现在他想报复这个世界，或者类似的事情。 -- Sometimes I try to forgive him because I understand how he feels.
