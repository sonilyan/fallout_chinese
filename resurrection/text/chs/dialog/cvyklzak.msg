#{100}{}{You see a man.}
{100}{}{你看到一个男人。}
#{150}{}{You see Lawteller.}
{150}{}{你看律师。}
#{200}{}{You see an old ragged man. He carries a strong stench.}
{200}{}{你看到一个衣衫褴褛的老人。他身上散发着浓烈的臭味。}
#{250}{}{You see Lawteller. He is an old, dirty and stinking man.}
{250}{}{你看律师。他是个又老又脏又臭的人。}
#{400}{}{Not even the Law of the Ring means anything anymore. This is the end of Corath.}
{400}{}{即使是魔戒法则也没有任何意义了。这是科拉斯的末日。}
#{500}{}{What? You must be new around here, I hope you don't want to start any trouble.}
{500}{}{什么？你一定是新来的，我希望你不要惹麻烦。}
#{501}{}{Who are you?}
{501}{}{你是谁？}
#{502}{}{Troublouble, huh huh.}
{502}{}{麻烦，哈哈。}
#{503}{}{I guess I better be going.}
{503}{}{我想我该走了。}
#{504}{}{You again? Your head must be a little screwy so just make sure you don't stir up any trouble.}
{504}{}{又是你？你的头一定有点神经兮兮的，别惹麻烦了。}
#{550}{}{They call me Lawteller. It's a title that used to carry some weight, but all that's left now is the title, as such.}
{550}{}{他们叫我律师。这是一个过去很有分量的标题，但现在只剩下标题了。}
#{551}{}{What does the title mean?}
{551}{}{标题是什么意思？}
#{600}{}{It means my job is to cater for the functioning of the principal law of this city. It's the Law of the Ring which hopefully still means something, even though I guess it's now mainly a joke to most people.}
{600}{}{这意味着我的工作是迎合本市主要法律的运作。这是戒指定律，希望它仍然有意义，尽管我猜现在对大多数人来说主要是个笑话。}
#{601}{}{What does it do?}
{601}{}{它有什么作用？}
#{650}{}{It's simple. If two people have a quarrel then, instead of hurting themselves or others, they resolve the quarrel - without weapons - in the ring, where there is only one rule: two enter, one comes out. Meaning they fight to the death.}
{650}{}{很简单。如果两个人吵架了，那么他们不是伤害自己或他人，而是在拳台上解决争吵――不带武器――只有一条规则：两人进入，一人出来。意味着他们战斗到死亡。}
#{651}{}{What's the point of that?}
{651}{}{这有什么意义？}
#{652}{}{Can you tell me what the rules for the fight are, exactly?}
{652}{}{你能确切地告诉我打斗的规则是什么吗？}
#{653}{}{Could someone else fight for them in the ring?}
{653}{}{其他人能在拳击场上为他们而战吗？}
#{654}{}{And these fights are public?}
{654}{}{这些打架是公开的吗？}
#{655}{}{How often do such fights take place?}
{655}{}{这种打斗多久发生一次？}
#{656}{}{Why is it a fight to the death?}
{656}{}{为什么要决一死战？}
#{657}{}{What do you think about Uncle being finished?}
{657}{}{你觉得叔叔完蛋了怎么样？}
#{658}{}{What do you think about Nestor being finished?}
{658}{}{你怎么看内斯特被完成了？}
#{659}{}{I see, that's all I need to know.}
{659}{}{我明白了，我只想知道这些。}
#{700}{}{Yes, each may select a substitute. I must confess that this part has already caused more than enough trouble for the city, perhaps we were wrong to allow it. Every one should risk their own lives, after all. [Sigh.] Why hadn't I thought of that.}
{700}{}{是的，每个人可以选择一个替代品。我必须承认，这一部分已经给城市带来了足够多的麻烦，也许我们允许它是错误的。毕竟，每个人都应该冒着生命危险。[叹气]我怎么没想到呢。}
#{701}{}{Hold on, it was you who created the Law?}
{701}{}{等等，是你创造了法律？}
#{702}{}{What kind of trouble?}
{702}{}{什么样的麻烦？}
#{703}{}{What if my substitute were to die in the fight?}
{703}{}{如果我的替补在战斗中牺牲了呢？}
#{704}{}{Can you tell me about this city?}
{704}{}{你能告诉我这个城市的情况吗？}
#{705}{}{Tell me again about the Law of the Ring.}
{705}{}{再告诉我一次魔戒的法则。}
#{706}{}{I'm leaving. See you.}
{706}{}{我要走了。再见。}
#{750}{}{Yes, it was all my idea. It was many years ago, years during which many people have died in the ring. I can only hope, and have always believed, that without the Law there would have been even more killing. I used to be the sheriff of this place and tried in vain to prevent the horrors around me. People will kill each other over the pettiest of affairs. [Shaking his head in disagreement.] I had to do something.}
{750}{}{是的，这都是我的主意。那是许多年前，许多人死于拳击场。我只能希望，也一直相信，没有法律，杀戮会更多。我曾经是这个地方的治安官，试图阻止我周围的恐怖，但徒劳无功。人们会为了最琐碎的事情互相残杀。[摇头表示不同意]我必须做点什么。}
#{751}{}{So you introduced a new law?}
{751}{}{所以你提出了新的法律？}
#{752}{}{Tell me again about the Law of the Ring.}
{752}{}{再告诉我一次魔戒的法则。}
#{753}{}{I'm leaving. See you.}
{753}{}{我要走了。再见。}
#{800}{}{I guess everyone liked the Law back then. I gave up the sheriff's office and made myself Lawteller, so I could make sure the Law was honored. I thought I would be better placed to help the people of this city that way, but it was just another one of my blunders. Over time, my position became obsolete. I don't decide anything any more, not even in the affairs of the ring, and the police never do anything under their new management. They think the Law of the Ring will solve all their problems for them. Nowadays, my only activity is just announcing the names of the fools entering the ring.}
{800}{}{我想当时每个人都喜欢法律。我放弃了治安官的职位，让自己当了法律出纳员，这样我就能确保法律得到尊重。我原以为这样能更好地帮助这个城市的人民，但这只是我的又一个错误。久而久之，我的职位就过时了。我再也不做任何决定了，即使是在拳击场上，警察在他们的新管理下也从不做任何事。他们认为魔戒法则会为他们解决所有的问题。现在，我唯一的活动就是宣布进入拳击场的傻瓜的名字。}
#{801}{}{If you don't like it, why don't you change it again?}
{801}{}{如果你不喜欢，为什么不再换一次呢？}
#{802}{}{Tell me again about the Law of the Ring.}
{802}{}{再告诉我一次魔戒的法则。}
#{803}{}{I'm leaving. See you.}
{803}{}{我要走了。再见。}
#{850}{}{I'm too old and I lost all my power a long time ago, I cannot change anything anymore. I'd probably only end up making things worse again anyway. Even though the Law doesn't work the way it should, it's still the only thing holding this city together.}
{850}{}{我太老了，很久以前我失去了所有的力量，我不能再改变任何事情了。不管怎样，我可能只会让事情变得更糟。尽管法律没有发挥应有的作用，但它仍然是维系这座城市的唯一力量。}
#{851}{}{How come?}
{851}{}{怎么会？}
#{852}{}{Can you tell me anything else about this city?}
{852}{}{你能告诉我关于这个城市的其他情况吗？}
#{853}{}{Tell me again about the Law of the Ring.}
{853}{}{再告诉我一次魔戒的法则。}
#{854}{}{I'm leaving. See you.}
{854}{}{我要走了。再见。}
#{900}{}{You must have noticed that Uncle and Nestor are after each other. And each is backed by a substantial portion of the city. Without the ring, or rather without the police who happen to like the Law of the Ring, those two would start a war. And that war would most likely be the end of Corath.}
{900}{}{你一定注意到叔叔和内斯特在互相追逐。每一个城市都有很大一部分城市作为后盾。如果没有魔戒，或者更确切地说，如果没有碰巧喜欢魔戒法则的警察，那两个人就会发动一场战争。那场战争很可能就是科拉斯的终结。}
#{901}{}{What role do the police play in all this?}
{901}{}{警察在这一切中扮演什么角色？}
#{902}{}{How come neither has eliminated the other yet?}
{902}{}{为什么两个都还没有淘汰另一个呢？}
#{903}{}{What are those two after, anyway?}
{903}{}{那两个人到底在干什么？}
#{904}{}{Can you tell me about Nestor?}
{904}{}{你能告诉我内斯特的情况吗？}
#{905}{}{Can you tell me about Uncle?}
{905}{}{你能告诉我叔叔的情况吗？}

{906}{}{再告诉我一次魔戒的法则。}
#{907}{}{I'm leaving. See you.}
{907}{}{我要走了。再见。}
#{950}{}{You mean you haven't met Blaster yet? Nestor only keeps that supermutant to fight for him in the ring. Any normal person would stay miles away from a supermutant, but we have one living right here in our city. It's a dangerous monster. Every day I worry about it getting out of control.}
{950}{}{你是说你还没见过布拉斯特？内斯特只留着那个超级毛驴在拳击场上为他而战。任何一个正常人都会远离超级毛驴，但我们城市里就住着一个。这是个危险的怪物。每天我都担心它失控。}
#{951}{}{Who would face a supermutant in the ring?!}
{951}{}{谁会在拳击场上面对超级变形金刚？！}
#{952}{}{Can you tell me about Nestor?}

{954}{}{我要走了。再见。}
#{1000}{}{There's always some fool who comes along. There was one just like that the other day. And when I saw the way Blaster downed him, I thought yet again it was all my fault.}
{1000}{}{总会有傻瓜出现。前几天就有一个这样的。当我看到爆炸手击落他的方式时，我又一次想到这都是我的错。}
#{1001}{}{Why would it be your fault?}
{1001}{}{为什么会是你的错？}
#{1002}{}{Who was that man?}
{1002}{}{那个人是谁？}
#{1003}{}{Tell me again about the Law of the Ring.}
{1003}{}{再告诉我一次魔戒的法则。}
#{1004}{}{I'm leaving. See you.}
{1004}{}{我要走了。再见。}
#{1050}{}{Just another guy who thought he could outsmart Nestor. The graveyard is full of guys like that.}
{1050}{}{只是另一个认为自己比内斯特聪明的人。墓地里满是这样的人。}
#{1051}{}{Can you tell me about Nestor?}
{1051}{}{你能告诉我内斯特的情况吗？}
#{1052}{}{Tell me again about the Law of the Ring.}
{1052}{}{再告诉我一次魔戒的法则。}
#{1053}{}{I'm leaving. See you.}
{1053}{}{我要走了。再见。}
#{1100}{}{They are public so that people remember the Law, and it's also a deterrent against people entering the ring. At least that was the reasoning then, but it's hard to imagine I ever believed it. In truth, the fights are the biggest attraction Corath has to offer. It's become "fun" around here to watch other people kill each other.}
{1100}{}{他们是公开的，这样人们就会记住法律，这也是对人们进入拳击场的一种威慑。至少那是当时的理由，但很难想象我会相信。事实上，格斗是科拉思最大的吸引力。在这里看着别人互相残杀变得很“有趣”。}
#{1101}{}{Can you tell me about Corath?}
{1101}{}{你能告诉我关于科拉斯的事吗？}
#{1102}{}{Tell me again about the Law of the Ring.}
{1102}{}{再告诉我一次魔戒的法则。}
#{1103}{}{I'm leaving. See you.}
{1103}{}{我要走了。再见。}
#{1150}{}{What's the point of anything? I hope that the Law of the Ring is the last thing which still has some point, some meaning. It's thanks to the Law people don't shoot each other in the street and die for stupid reasons. If two people have a quarrel they rather solve it with words than risk their lives in the ring. Or at least that's the way it was supposed to work. The truth is it's probably the only thing holding this city together. It must be enough.}
{1150}{}{有什么意义吗？我希望魔戒法则是最后一个仍然有意义的东西。多亏了法律，人们才不会在街上互相枪杀，也不会因为愚蠢的理由而死去。如果两个人吵架，他们宁愿用言语来解决，也不愿冒生命危险。或者至少应该是这样的。事实上，这可能是唯一能让这座城市团结在一起的东西。一定够了。}
#{1151}{}{How come it's the only thing keeping the city in one piece?}
{1151}{}{为什么这是唯一能让城市完整的东西？}

{1156}{}{为什么要决一死战？}
#{1157}{}{I see, that's all I need to know.}
{1157}{}{我明白了，我只想知道这些。}
#{1200}{}{Too often. Most locals would rather resolve their quarrels with reasonable words than risk their lives in the ring, but there are those exceptional few who are always ready to gamble with death for some measly change. Mostly they are strangers who rush head-first into the fight, because it's the only thing they know how to do. I guess I'll be announcing you soon enough.}
{1200}{}{太频繁了。大多数当地人宁愿用合理的语言来解决他们的争吵，也不愿冒着生命危险在拳击场上，但也有少数例外的人，他们总是准备用死亡来换取一些微不足道的改变。大多数情况下，他们都是陌生人，他们会第一个冲向战场，因为这是他们唯一知道的方法。我想我很快就会通知你的。}
#{1201}{}{Who was the stranger in the last fight?}
{1201}{}{上次打架的陌生人是谁？}
#{1202}{}{Tell me again about the Law of the Ring.}

{1203}{}{我要走了。再见。}
#{1250}{}{Do you think that losing a fistfight would convince anyone to stop claiming they are right in any dispute, however insignificant it was? Such people would have all the more reason to hate their rival. Unfortunately, it's the only way. Death is the ultimate solution. And I guess that's true even when the dead man is somebody's substitute.}
{1250}{}{你认为输掉一场斗殴会说服任何人停止声称他们在任何争端中是正确的，无论这是多么微不足道吗？这样的人更有理由憎恨他们的对手。不幸的是，这是唯一的办法。死亡是最终的解决办法。我想这是真的，即使死人是别人的替代品。}

#{2150}{}{If you can get it through your thick skull, you should know we at least have one thing the savages in the wilderness don't have. We have the Law of the Ring. No fighting is allowed in our city. If you have a problem with anyone, you have to resolve it in the ring, without weapons. I am the Lawteller and it's my job to cater for the functioning of that Law, if you can still call it that. Perhaps you think I'm just an old coot who can hardly do you harm, and you're right. But then again, there is the police to make sure you don't stir up trouble in our city.}
{2150}{}{如果你能通过你的头骨，你应该知道我们至少有一件野人在野外没有的东西。我们有戒指定律。我们城市不许打仗。如果你和任何人有问题，你必须在拳击场解决，不带武器。我是法律的出纳员，我的工作就是迎合法律的运作，如果你还可以这么说的话。也许你认为我只是个老傻瓜，几乎不能伤害你，你是对的。但话说回来，警察会确保你不会在我们的城市挑起事端。}

{2151}{}{毛茸茸的，白斑！格洛尔！}
#{2152}{}{Huh-ugh.}
{2152}{}{嗯，呃。}
#{2200}{}{Since there are bums like you congregating in our city nowadays, I guess things can only turn out for the worse from now on. Or is it that you want to learn about the Law of the Ring? And only after you've fought in the ring, at that?}
{2200}{}{既然像你这样的流浪汉现在聚集在我们的城市里，我想从现在起事情只会变得更糟。还是你想学习魔戒的法则？只有你在拳击场上打过之后？}

#{2400}{}{Might the reason for your interest be that you are determined to enter the ring yourself? [Sigh.] Two enter, one comes out, and that is what determines everything else.

#{2409}{}{I see, that's all I need to know.}
{2409}{}{我明白了，我只想知道这些。}
#{2450}{}{Well, first you should ask whether the quarrel is worth another person dying for it. If that happens, the winner gets all the earthly possessions of the substitute.

#{2500}{}{You need a good reason to fight in the ring. Even though it may be true that Francis does not bother investigating common quarrels, he makes sure to be thorough where Uncle and Nestor are concerned. Three times already has Uncle found serious enough accusations to demand Nestor's ousting. Never mind what they were exactly, but of course they were to do with the mine - as everything is, in Corath. But Blaster tore all of Uncle's killers to pieces in the ring. Literally. So Nestor was found innocent and could remain in the city.}
{2500}{}{你需要一个很好的理由来参加拳击比赛。尽管弗朗西斯并不费心调查常见的争吵，但他确保在涉及叔叔和内斯特的问题上是彻底的。伯父已经三次受到足够严重的指控，要求内斯特下台。不管它们到底是什么，但它们当然是和我的有关――一切都是这样，在科拉斯。但是爆炸手把杀死叔叔的凶手都撕成碎片。真的。所以内斯特被判无罪，可以留在城里。}
