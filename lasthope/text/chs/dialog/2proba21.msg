### {114}{}{Basil's men did it, and I saw the whole thing! It was late, almost midnight. I was coming back from the field and saw two men and Mr. Basil. At first I thought they were just looking for something they had lost, but when I came a little closer I saw another person laying on the ground. I couldn't tell if that person passed out or... gone for real, but they didn't leave the poor guy on the ground. Instead they dragged him all the way and quickly disappeared into the night. I don't know where they left after that, it was too dangerous to even think of following them in the middle of the night. I tried to tell what happened... got ridiculed every time.}
