{202}{}{看起来我不属于这里。目前为止}
### {203}{}{Don't get me wrong, but... Don't you know that this is a city of dead people? We even raise the prices to the normies so that they don't stay here.}
{203}{}{别误会我的意思，但是...你不知道这是一座死人之城吗？我们甚至把价格提高到正常水平，这样他们就不会留在这里了。}
### {204}{}{I know. Don't worry, I won't disturb your glorious company.}

### {223}{}{Is this a pre-war menu?}
{223}{}{这是战前的菜单吗？}
### {224}{}{To the point. What comes with caravans from the north mostly stays in the Old Town. And mere crumbs reach us. That's why I often cook from pre-war products. But we, the undead, like it even more. Oh, nostalgia! That's just one detail missing for the full range of flavors ? good old coffee. How can there be a cafe without coffee?}
{224}{}{切中要害。来自北方的大篷车大多停留在老城。只有面包屑到达我们这里。这就是为什么我经常用战前的产品做饭。但我们这些不死族更喜欢它。哦，怀旧！这只是全系列口味中缺少的一个细节? 好的老咖啡。没有咖啡怎么可能有咖啡馆？}

### {229}{}{On the other hand, I had no plans to gather on the ruins. But I'll make a note in the Peep-Fight.}

{237}{}{对不起...或者也许我们会得出结论？每瓶我要付三倍的价钱。}

### {240}{}{Thanks for the electricity, }
{240}{}{谢谢你的电，}

{242}{}{谢谢，埃德。我肯定需要这个。}
### {243}{}{That's all? Okay, let's at least do this for what it is.}
