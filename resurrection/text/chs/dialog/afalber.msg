{8700}{}{是的，我看到了。你的动作是人类极限所允许的最快最流畅的。给你做手术毫无意义，除非你想成为捐赠者。}
#{8750}{}{The intelligence increasing surgery could help you significantly, though it is also possible that it won't make much of a difference. The result will depend on the current state of your brain, and we won't find out what it is until we open up your skull. It's also the most complex surgery that we do here. It costs 30000 caps, and involves a three week convalescence period.}
{8750}{}{提高智力的手术可能会对你有很大的帮助，尽管它也有可能不会有太大的区别。结果将取决于你的大脑目前的状态，在我们打开你的头骨之前，我们不会知道它是什么。这也是我们这里做的最复杂的手术。费用为30000瓶盖，包括3周的恢复期。}
#{8751}{}{Bhoo! [Give him 30000 caps.]}
{8751}{}{呜呜！[给他30000个瓶盖]}
#{8800}{}{Lie on the bed and I will put you to sleep. The surgery will take a few hours. [Doctor Falber injects you with something and you lose consciousness.]}
{8800}{}{躺在床上，我会让你睡着的。手术需要几个小时。[福伯医生给你注射了一些东西，你失去了意识。]}
#{8801}{}{[Fall asleep.]}
{8801}{}{[睡着了。]}
#{8850}{}{You've had a small and stunted brain since birth, and you've also suffered permanent brain damage due to serious head injuries.

#{8900}{}{You've had a small and stunted brain since birth, and you've also suffered heavy brain damage due to serious head injuries. Thankfully, the damage was not as permanent as it appeared.

{8900}{}{你从出生开始就有一个小而发育不良的大脑，而且由于严重的头部损伤，你也遭受了严重的大脑损伤。值得庆幸的是，这种损害并不像看上去的那样是永久性的。我做得很好―你现在可以连贯地表达自己了。这比任何人对你的期望都要高。}

{8902}{}{呃...哦。太好了，谢谢你，医生。}
#{8950}{}{Are you interested in one of the procedures or are you just unforgivably wasting my time?}
{8950}{}{你是对其中一个手术感兴趣还是你只是在不可原谅地浪费我的时间？}
#{9000}{}{You have a floater? The fact that the Master and his scientists were able to create something like that shows their amazing skill, doesn't it? I'm surprised they let you into the city with it. Though I suppose not many know their real origin nowadays. Despite that, I'm not taking the risk of allowing a floater here in the hospital, so kindly take it away.}
{9000}{}{你有个浮游特？大师和他的科学家们能够创造出这样的东西，这表明了他们惊人的技能，不是吗？我很惊讶他们让你带着它进城。不过我想现在知道它们真正起源的人不多了。尽管如此，我不会冒险让一个浮游特在医院里，所以请你把它带走。}
#{9001}{}{Ugh.}
{9001}{}{啊。}
#{9050}{}{Welcome, Hunter. I am doctor Falber, the head of this hospital. What brings you to us? If you are looking for quality medical services then look no further.}
{9050}{}{欢迎，猎人。我是福伯医生，医院的院长。什么风把你吹来了？如果你正在寻找高质量的医疗服务，那么不用再找了。}
#{9056}{}{My mistake.}
{9056}{}{我的错误。}
#{9100}{}{Welcome, Hunter. [He smiles like a cat that just caught a mouse.] I am doctor Falber, the head of this hospital. What brings you to us? If you are looking for quality medical services then look no further.}
{9100}{}{欢迎，猎人。[他笑得像一只刚逮到老鼠的猫。]我是福伯医生，这家医院的院长，什么风把你吹来了？如果你正在寻找高质量的医疗服务，那么不用再找了。}
#{9150}{}{Welcome again. There is no need to worry, many Hunters count themselves among our customers.}
{9150}{}{欢迎再次光临。不用担心，很多猎人都是我们的客户。}
#{9160}{}{Considering we defend the city from mutants, how about you give us Hunters a discount?}
{9160}{}{考虑到我们要保护城市不受变种人的侵害，不如你给我们猎人打个折吧？}
#{9161}{}{I'll be on my way, bye.}
{9161}{}{我要走了，再见。}
#{9200}{}{As I'm sure you know, commander Herman decides what happens in the city. And since he's a reasonable man, he won't interfere in our business as long as we neither treat nor make use of mutants. And I can assure you that when we do discover a mutant, we send his body to your base right away. Of course, that happens only rarely. Your people are quite diligent in preventing mutants from entering Albuquerque.}
{9200}{}{我相信你知道，赫尔曼指挥官决定着这个城市会发生什么。因为他是个通情达理的人，只要我们既不治疗也不利用变种人，他就不会干涉我们的生意。我可以向你保证，当我们发现一个变种人时，我们会立即将他的尸体送到你的基地。当然，这种情况很少发生。你们的人非常努力地阻止变种人进入阿尔伯克基。}
#{9201}{}{But doctor Yaotzin doesn't seem to think of your hospital too highly.}
{9201}{}{但耀津医生似乎对你的医院评价不高。}

{9204}{}{我想尝试做点什么都是没有意义的。}
#{9250}{}{I was hoping you were a reasonable man. But if that's how you see things, I have no choice but to exclude you from our plan.

Here is 500 caps, I never owe anyone anything, and now leave.}
{9250}{}{我希望你是个讲道理的人。但如果你是这么想的，我别无选择，只能把你排除在我们的计划之外。如果你试图告诉赫尔曼任何事，我会否认一切。而且，正如你所看到的那样，他觉得我很值得信任。这里是500瓶盖，我从来不欠任何人任何东西，现在离开。}

#{9350}{}{Our prices reflect the quality of our services. And we never lower the quality, and thus the price, for anyone.}
{9350}{}{我们的价格反映了我们服务的质量，我们从不降低任何人的质量，因此也不降低价格。}
#{9351}{}{If you won't give me a discount, I might shoot you and justify it by saying that you treat even mutants.}
{9351}{}{如果你不给我折扣，我可能会杀了你，然后说你连变种人都治疗。}
#{9352}{}{It was worth a try.}
{9352}{}{值得一试。}
#{9400}{}{I feel compelled to note that a large number of Hunters were treated here, thus, few would be willing to believe such a tale. The only thing you would accomplish by trying to kill me would be passing on your organs to one of your wiser compatriots, everything with commander Herman's permission.}
{9400}{}{我不得不指出，这里治疗过大量的猎人，因此，很少有人愿意相信这样的故事。你想杀我的唯一目的就是把你的器官交给一个更聪明的同胞，只要得到赫尔曼指挥官的允许。}

{9401}{}{我们走着瞧！}
#{9402}{}{OK, I apologize. Forget about it.}
{9402}{}{OK，我道歉。算了吧。}
#{9450}{}{Paul has informed me that the donor collection went off without any serious complications. I never hold off paying for quality work, here's 10000 caps.

{10001}{}{OK。}
#{10050}{}{Interesting, that does explain a lot. But I'm afraid I really don't know anything about the tribals. As I'm sure you realize, they aren't often our customers, so I don't care about their lives much.}
{10050}{}{有意思，这解释了很多问题。但恐怕我对部落一无所知。我相信你也知道，他们通常不是我们的客户，所以我不太关心他们的生活。}
#{10051}{}{What do you mean it explains a lot?}
{10051}{}{什么叫解释了很多事？}
#{10100}{}{That's none of your business. And that's all I'm going to say on this matter. Goodbye.}
{10100}{}{那不关你的事。这就是我要说的。再见。}
#{10101}{}{Goodbye.}
{10101}{}{再见。}
#{10150}{}{Hold on. We found out that you received a number of transplants in the past. I'm curious why and, more importantly, who performed them? They were done so expertly that, were it not for our meticulous diagnosis both before and after the surgery, we wouldn't have even noticed.}
{10150}{}{等一下。我们发现你过去接受过多次移植手术。我很好奇为什么，更重要的是，是谁做的？他们做得非常专业，如果不是我们在手术前后都进行了细致的诊断，我们甚至都不会注意到。}
#{10151}{}{Hold on. We found out that you received a number of transplants in the past. I'm curious why and, more importantly, who performed them? They were done so expertly that, were it not for our meticulous diagnosis both before and after the surgery, we wouldn't have even noticed.}
{10151}{}{等一下。我们发现你过去接受过多次移植手术。我很好奇为什么，更重要的是，是谁做的？他们做得非常专业，如果不是我们在手术前后都进行了细致的诊断，我们甚至都不会注意到。}
#{10152}{}{Really? Could you tell me more? Do you have even an idea who could've done something like that?}
{10152}{}{真的吗？你能告诉我更多吗？你知道是谁干的吗？}
#{10153}{}{I've not intention to talk about it. I'm sorry. Goodbye.}
{10153}{}{我不想谈这个，对不起，再见。}
#{10200}{}{You're asking me? I doubt anyone could've performed surgery this complex on you without your knowing. I don't know anyone with access to technology that would be advanced enough to perform the transplants. I'd certainly like to meet such people. We're talking about a fully equipped medical facility and a team of surgeons trained specifically for this task. Not even the empire has the capacity for that. Or were they experimenting on you? If I were to dissect your body, I'm sure I could find out the reason for it all.}
{10200}{}{你在问我吗？我怀疑没人能在你不知情的情况下给你做这么复杂的手术。我不知道有谁能掌握足够先进的技术来进行移植手术。我当然想认识这样的人。我们说的是一个设备齐全的医疗设施和一个受过专门训练的外科医生团队。即使是帝国也没有这个能力。还是他们在你身上做实验？如果我解剖你的身体，我肯定能找出原因。}
#{10201}{}{You're not dissecting me, forget about it. Anyway, thanks for the information. Later.}
{10201}{}{你不能解剖我，算了吧，不管怎样，谢谢你的信息，以后再说。}
