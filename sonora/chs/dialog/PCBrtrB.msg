And I not only sell, but also repair all these things so that they serve the new owners at least a little time.}
{225}{}{你想自己在废墟中翻找吗？不客气！只是不要忘记辐射、动物、土匪、山体滑坡和其他一系列问题，这些问题只会让你陷入困境。我不仅出售，还修理所有这些东西，以便它们至少能为新主人服务一点时间。}

#Quest to find Vault 27
### {240}{}{Have you come across items from Vaults?}
{240}{}{你有没有遇到过避难所里的物品？}

{241}{}{避难所？你在说什么...啊，我明白了！Vault Tec Vault是一个真正的传奇。他们说我们的一些祖先在大战后就住在那里。但是时间已经过去了，没有人知道这些避难所的位置。}
### {242}{}{And who can know?}
{242}{}{谁能知道呢？}
### {243}{}{You need to go to the Followers of Fire. There is so much knowledge in their library that they themselves no longer know what to do with it. Maybe the coordinates of the Vaults are there. That's just they won't want to share without a good reason.}
{243}{}{你需要去火的追随者那里。他们的图书馆里有太多的知识，以至于他们自己都不知道该怎么办了。也许避难所的坐标就在那里。这只是他们不想在没有充分理由的情况下分享。}

{244}{}{但是拾荒者呢？}
### {245}{}{Heh, do you think a normal scavenger would disclose the location of Vaults? After all, according to legend, there are a hell of a lot of relics stored there! But if you have a chatty tongue, then visit Bob in the slums. He's one of the oldest scavengers in Phoenix.}
{245}{}{呵呵，你认为一个普通的拾荒者会透露避难所的位置吗？毕竟，根据传说，那里存放着大量的文物！但如果你有一个健谈的舌头，那就去贫民窟看望鲍勃。他是凤凰城最古老的拾荒者之一。}
### {246}{}{Clear.}
{246}{}{清楚的}

#Consultation on subjects
### {250}{}{I need advice on old subjects.}

{264}{}{哇，很少能找到一块工作状态良好的怀表。这个品牌一直以质量著称。此外，原子电池可以使用几十年。如果铁匠们在这里，他们会用手把这个东西撕下来。}
### {265}{}{[Snow globe]}
{265}{}{[雪球]}

### {267}{}{[Medal for Bravery]}
{267}{}{[银英勇勋章]}
### {268}{}{Operation Anchorage... Somewhere in the old newspapers I read about this massacre. It seems that the USA was proud of its victory then. I don't even know who can be pleased with such a find now. Do you know the notorious patriots of "that country"? I'm not.}
{268}{}{安克雷奇行动...我在旧报纸上读到关于这场大屠杀的消息。当时美国似乎为自己的胜利感到骄傲。我甚至不知道现在谁会对这样的发现感到高兴。你知道“那个国家”那些臭名昭著的爱国者吗？我不是。}

### {273}{}{[Photo]}
{273}{}{[照片]}
### {274}{}{A snapshot of the big bang? So that's how it was... Scary. It is not necessary to show this thing to mere mortals. Better find a bald connoisseur of ancient history if you want to talk about the Great War.}
{274}{}{大爆炸的快照？所以事情就是这样...恐怖的没有必要把这东西展示给凡人。如果你想谈论大战，最好找一位秃头的古代历史鉴赏家。}

{275}{}{[带牙冠的牙齿]}
### {276}{}{It's just a tooth with a crown. Let me take a look under a magnifying glass... so... No, there's something here. We need a microscope... so... wow. Yes, it's not just a crown, it's some kind of chip. Or a magnetic key. Or maybe an information storage device. It's too complicated for me. Only tinkerers understand such high technologies.}
{276}{}{这只是一颗带牙冠的牙齿。让我在放大镜下看看...所以…不，这里有东西。我们需要一台显微镜...所以…哇。是的，它不仅仅是一顶王冠，它还是某种芯片。或者一把磁性钥匙。或者可能是一个信息存储设备。这对我来说太复杂了。只有修修补补的人才懂这么高的技术。}
### {277}{}{[Arizona Flag]}
{277}{}{[亚利桑那州旗帜]}
### {278}{}{One of the flags of the Old World. Most of these flags have decayed, but this one is surprisingly well preserved. They should be waving at the colonizers in the north at the right time. And there are few conservatives left in our city.}
{278}{}{旧世界的一面旗帜。这些旗帜大多已经腐朽，但这面却出奇地保存完好。他们应该在适当的时候向北方的殖民者挥手。在我们的城市里，保守派所剩无几。}

### {283}{}{[The surviving book]}
{283}{}{[幸存的书]}

{285}{}{[一罐咖啡]}
