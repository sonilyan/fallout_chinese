{100}{}{Damn, you're better than I thought. [Smiles.] But we aren't over yet! Let's see what you can do with your
 melee skills... [Gives you a small knife.]}
{101}{}{Alright, I'm ready.}
#
{102}{}{Well, your progress is good but you still have a lot to learn. I will stand aside now. Proceed to the next
 chamber. My assistant is waiting for you. And of course... You won't be needing this. [He takes your knife.]}
{103}{}{Heh, I forgot about that. I'm going then.}
#
{104}{}{Let us begin. Show me what you're made of!}
#
{105}{}{Defend yourself!}
#
{106}{}{Hey, I promise I won't use it... Damn it.}
#player cheater...
{107}{}{...hold on a second! [Looks at those rocks, grabs them from your inventory.] You were supposed to leave
 these where they belong! Don't you try anything like this again, got it!}
{108}{}{Sure...}
{109}{}{Just go to hell.}
#109
{110}{}{[Thinks for a second.] Guess what, new order just came in... your time's up!}
{111}{}{Bring it on...}
