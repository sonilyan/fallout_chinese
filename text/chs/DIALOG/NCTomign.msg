#{100}{}{You see Thompson.}
{100}{}{你看汤普森。}
#{101}{}{You see a formidable man. He oozez of authority.}
{101}{}{你看到一个可怕的人。他失去了权威。}
#{102}{}{He looks disheveled and depressed.}
{102}{}{他看上去衣冠不整，情绪低落。}
#{103}{}{I'll give you one minute.}
{103}{}{我给你一分钟。}
#{110}{}{You have the nerve to show your face here? I had high hopes in you. We could have done so much together. We could have turned this town around! But no, you're a political prostitute like all the others! I don't need you. Get out!}
{110}{}{你有勇气在这里露脸？我对你寄予厚望。我们本来可以一起做这么多的。我们本可以扭转这个城市！但不，你和其他人一样是个政治妓女！我不需要你。走出！}
#{111}{}{I'll just go, before I spoil your good mood.}
{111}{}{我要走了，免得破坏你的好心情。}
#{112}{}{I won't leave until I kill you!}
{112}{}{杀了你我才离开！}
#{115}{}{[He looks you up and down carefully] You obviously didn't wander in here by accident. What are you doing in my headquarters?}
{115}{}{[他仔细地上下打量着你]很明显你不是偶然来到这里的。你在我的总部干什么？}
#{116}{}{*Your* headquarters? And who declared you mayor?}
{116}{}{*你的总部？谁宣布你为市长？}
#{117}{}{You've got a lot of armed men around here. I want to know more about you.}
{117}{}{这里有很多武装人员。我想多了解你。}
#{118}{}{I've seen your posters. I'm interested. Can you tell me about your movement?}
{118}{}{我看过你的海报。我很感兴趣。你能告诉我你的动作吗？}
#{119}{}{Look around. I'm the people's choice. They'd vote for me, if they had the opportunity.}
{119}{}{看看周围。我是人民的选择。如果有机会，他们会投我一票。}
#{120}{}{It would be my pleasure. The idea is simple: we re-establish the town hall and its mayor, just as it was after the Great War. Why, you ask? Because this city's problems began when we lost the rule of law. Without a central authority, power shifted to the city's business moguls, who tried to take complete control for themselves. This is what turned neighbor against neighbor and kicked off the civil war. I want to bring things back to the way they were 40 years ago - and the majority of Reno's citizens agree with me.}
{120}{}{这将是我的荣幸。想法很简单：我们重建市政厅和市长，就像二战后一样。为什么，你问？因为这个城市的问题是从我们失去法治开始的。在没有中央权力的情况下，权力转移到了城市的商业巨头身上，他们试图完全控制自己。这就是使邻国与邻国对立并引发内战的原因。我想让事情回到40年前的样子――雷诺的大多数市民都同意我的看法。}
#{121}{}{We're very busy here. If you don't have business to discuss, don't distract people from their work.}
{121}{}{我们这里很忙。如果你没有生意要谈，不要分散人们对工作的注意力。}
#{122}{}{I'd like to know more about your movement.}
{122}{}{我想知道更多关于你的行动。}
#{123}{}{Understood.}
{123}{}{理解。}
#{124}{}{I won't take up any more of your time.}
{124}{}{我不会再占用你的时间了。}
#{130}{}{[A man leans over and whispers in his ear. After a minute, he turns to you, his eyes narrowing.] We have nothing to discuss.}
{130}{}{[一个男人俯身在他耳边低语。过了一会儿，他转向你，眯起了眼睛。]我们没什么好讨论的。}
#{131}{}{Alright, then I'll just go.}
{131}{}{好吧，那我就走。}
#{132}{}{Let's make one thing clear: every single man here is devoted to the cause. I have no place for mercenaries or "political prostitutes". If you want to be one of us, you have to convince me you're trustworthy and committed.}
{132}{}{让我们明确一点：这里的每一个人都致力于这项事业。我没有雇佣兵或“政治妓女”的地方。如果你想成为我们中的一员，你必须让我相信你是值得信赖和忠诚的。}
#{133}{}{I have nothing to prove. I work with whatever person I think is right. Either you trust me, or I walk.}
{133}{}{我没有什么要证明的。我和任何我认为正确的人一起工作。要么你相信我，要么我走。}
#{134}{}{Ask anyone at Mr. Bertolini's casino. My reputation speaks for itself.}
{134}{}{问问伯托里尼赌场的人。我的名声不言而喻。}
#{135}{}{I have connections with Big Louie. Think about it. You want him as your friend. You *don't* want him as your enemy.}
{135}{}{我和大路易有关系。好好想想。你想让他成为你的朋友。你不想让他成为你的敌人。}
#{136}{}{Give me a chance! I'm sick of playing the small game - I want to move on to the big leagues!}
{136}{}{给我一个机会！我厌倦了玩小游戏-我想去大联盟！}
#{137}{}{}
{137}{}{}
#{138}{}{I'm listening.}
{138}{}{我在听。}
#{139}{}{I guess I can't prove that.}
{139}{}{我想我不能证明这一点。}
#{140}{}{Heh. If we were tribals in the desert, I'd have pulled your guts out for that kind of talk. But here in Reno, I need people with your... Gumption. Anyway, first I want to test you.}
{140}{}{嘿。如果我们是沙漠里的部落，我会把你拉出来听那种谈话。但是在里诺，我需要有你的。。。进取心。不管怎样，首先我想测试你。}
#{141}{}{Yes, I've heard of you. I think we can do business together. But first - I want to test you.}
{141}{}{是的，我听说过你。我想我们可以一起做生意。但首先-我想测试你。}
#{142}{}{The Big One and I don't have the... Relationships... We used to. But the last thing I want is his interference, especially with that new hardware he's toting. Fine, but first - I want to test you.}
{142}{}{大的那个我没有。。。关系。。。我们以前是。但我最不希望的是他的干扰，尤其是他带的新硬件。好吧，但首先-我想测试你。}
#{143}{}{About the job... }
{143}{}{关于工作。。。}
#{144}{}{Is it done?}
{144}{}{完成了吗？}
#{145}{}{I'm on it, boss.}
{145}{}{我来，老大。}
#{146}{}{[Raises his voice] Then what the hell are you doing here?! Don't waste my time! The next time I see you that job is better to be done!}
{146}{}{[提高声音]那你到底在这里干什么？！别浪费我的时间！下次我再见到你的时候，那工作最好还是完成！}
#{147}{}{[Leave]}
{147}{}{[离开]}
#{148}{}{Hmm. You speak with confidence, and I know you have... Skills... That could be useful to me. But first, I want to see if you're suitable.}
{148}{}{嗯。你说话很自信，我知道你。。。技能。。。那对我可能有用。但首先，我想看看你是否合适。}
#{150}{}{A couple of lowlifes dared to abuse my girls near the casino. I was going to send Billy, but I want to see how you work. Deal with them and report back with the results.}
{150}{}{几个卑鄙的人敢在赌场附近虐待我的女儿。我本来要派比利去的，但我想看看你的工作情况。处理并报告结果。}
#{151}{}{What's the pay?}
{151}{}{薪水是多少？}
#{152}{}{Alright, I'll do it.}
{152}{}{好吧，我来做。}
#{153}{}{I'll check it out.}
{153}{}{我去看看。}
#{154}{}{I want to save Reno from itself, and all you care about is money?! Maybe - maybe! - Paige can help you with money, if you're polite. Now, enough chatter. Next time I see you, I want your results.}
{154}{}{我想救雷诺，你只关心钱？！也许-也许！-如果你有礼貌的话，佩奇可以帮你赚钱。现在，闲聊够了。下次见到你，我要你的结果。}
#{155}{}{I gave those thugs what they deserved. Now they know who's the boss around here.}
{155}{}{我给了那些暴徒应得的。现在他们知道谁是这里的老板了。}
#{156}{}{Bad news, boss - Betty Paige is dead.}
{156}{}{坏消息，老大-贝蒂・佩奇死了。}
#{157}{}{[Slams his fists on the table] DAMMIT! This wouldn't have happened if my boys had kept a closer eye on things! I'm gonna have to lay down the law on my enforcers.}
{157}{}{他妈的！如果我的孩子们仔细观察事情，就不会发生这种事！我得对我的执法者制定法律。}
#{158}{}{That's good. I hope you were on your best behavior with Paige. Even to her, we can't show any weakness.}
{158}{}{那很好。我希望你和佩奇相处得很好。即使对她，我们也不能示弱。}
#{159}{}{[Next]}
{159}{}{[下一步]}
#{160}{}{Even in that suit, you still look like a raider.}
{160}{}{即使穿上那套衣服，你还是像个袭击者。}
#{161}{}{Maybe to an out-of-towner like you, but around here I fit right in. The people trust me.}
{161}{}{也许对你这样的外地人来说，但在这里我很适合。人民信任我。}
#{162}{}{But you lie to them.}
{162}{}{但你对他们撒谎。}
#{163}{}{Of course I lie to them! Power doesn't come from weapons or badges. It's lies. The more you lie, the more powerful you get - and I'm very good at lying. No one wants the truth! They'd rather pretend they're something they're not. I tell them what they want to hear, and I bend that just enough to get what I want. That's real power.}
{163}{}{我当然骗他们！权力不是来自武器或徽章。这是谎言。你越撒谎，你就越有力量-我很擅长撒谎。没有人想要真相！他们宁愿假装自己不是。我告诉他们他们想听什么，然后我就把它弯成我想要的样子。这才是真正的力量。}
#{164}{}{Hmm, what an interesting opinion.}
{164}{}{嗯，多有趣的观点啊。}
#{165}{}{Do you know anything about the attack on the courier from Las Vegas?}
{165}{}{你知道拉斯维加斯信使遇袭的事吗？}
#{166}{}{The Big One is still trying to play me. He knows I have to be involved in that, because of my relationship with Ricardo Bertolini. It's just one more move in the game we're playing.}
{166}{}{大家伙还在耍我。他知道我必须参与其中，因为我和里卡多・贝托里尼的关系。这只是我们游戏中的又一个动作。}
#{167}{}{Let's talk like one raider to another.}
{167}{}{让我们像一个袭击者对另一个一样交谈。}
#{168}{}{What?! Oh, that's right. Sometimes I forget who I'm talking to. You don't look like a raider, you know. But the Big One has a good eye for people.}
{168}{}{什么？！哦，没错。有时我忘了我在和谁说话。你看起来不像个袭击者，你知道的。但是大的眼睛对人很有眼光。}
#{169}{}{Then let's not delve into our common past.}
{169}{}{那我们就别再深究我们共同的过去了。}
#{170}{}{How did you and Stryker end up like this?}
{170}{}{你和史崔克怎么会变成这样？}
#{171}{}{I'll give you the short version. Five years ago the Big One took over Reno. After ruling it for a year, he went back to the wasteland and left me and Stryker in charge. But then Stryker got started on his own idiotic politics, so we split up. Reno's business owners took advantage of the conflict and tried to get rid of us. Now we're on the edge - either one of us wins, or Reno pushes us out completely.}
{171}{}{我给你简短的版本。五年前大公司接管了雷诺。在统治了一年之后，他回到荒地，让我和史崔克负责。但后来史崔克开始了他自己的白痴政治，所以我们分手了。雷诺的老板利用了这场冲突，试图摆脱我们。现在我们处于边缘――要么我们中的一个获胜，要么雷诺把我们彻底赶出去。}
#{172}{}{That explains things.}
{172}{}{这就解释了。}
#{180}{}{What is this place?}
{180}{}{这是什么地方？}
#{181}{}{This building was Reno's old town hall, and down here was the bomb shelter for its employees. It's been a long time since there was any authority here, of course. Once they threw out the mayor, the business owners tried to set up shop here, but it didn't last long.}
{181}{}{这座建筑是雷诺的老市政厅，下面是员工的防空洞。当然，这里很久没有任何权威了。一旦他们赶走了市长，企业主们就想在这里开店，但没持续多久。}
#{182}{}{What happened?}
{182}{}{怎么搞的？}
#{183}{}{Civil war. First it was the business owners fighting over the town, then it was just riots. That was until the Big One came in and put his own people, like me, in charge.}
{183}{}{内战。一开始是企业主在镇上打架，后来只是骚乱。直到那个大人物进来让他自己的人像我一样负责。}
#{184}{}{Why did Big Louie leave town?}
{184}{}{为什么大路易要离开城里？}
#{185}{}{He's not as "big" as everyone thinks, alright? I think you've already got an idea what happened.}
{185}{}{他没有大家想象的那么“大”，好吗？我想你已经知道发生了什么。}
#{186}{}{[Next]}
{186}{}{[下一步]}
#{187}{}{I'm not going to discuss it with you. It's a personal matter, just between us. You don't want to get involved.}
{187}{}{我不会和你讨论的。这是我们之间的私事。你不想卷入其中。}
#{188}{}{Alright.}
{188}{}{好吧。}
#{189}{}{He had money, power, the whole town in the palm of his hand, so why'd he leave? I know why. He didn't want any of those things. He was chasing a dream... Or a memory. He grew up in Reno during its "Golden Age", when people had what they needed and weren't fighting with each other. I guess he thought he could bring that back. But it was a load of crap. Reno couldn't be like that anymore - hell, maybe what he remembered never really existed. And when he realized that, he ran back to the wasteland. He'd rather live in isolation than with the result of everything he worked for.}
{189}{}{他手握金钱、权力和整个城镇，那他为什么要离开？我知道为什么。他不想要这些东西。他在追逐梦想。。。或者是记忆。他在里诺的“黄金时代”长大，那时人们有自己需要的东西，彼此之间没有争斗。我猜他以为他能把它带回来。但那是一堆废话。雷诺不可能再这样了-见鬼，也许他所记得的从来就不存在。当他意识到这一点时，他跑回了荒地。他宁愿与世隔绝地生活，也不愿与他为之工作的一切结果为伍。}
#{190}{}{And what about you? What are you working for?}
{190}{}{那你呢？你在干什么？}
#{191}{}{That's very interesting. I need some time to think about that.}
{191}{}{那很有趣。我需要时间考虑一下。}
#{192}{}{Heh. I want to be in charge. Don't look at me like that - this isn't just another racket. I know a little about Reno's history.}
{192}{}{嘿。我想负责。别那样看着我-这不只是另一场闹剧。我对雷诺的历史略知一二。}
#{193}{}{What part of Reno's history?}
{193}{}{雷诺历史的哪一部分？}
#{194}{}{Just after the Great War. Look around! Do you know what this city is? It's a monument to an old idea. Back then, Reno was ruled by a dictator called the mayor. His retinue crawled at his feet and begged for his mercy, his objectors were led to the firing squad, and the useless dreamers were sent to the slave cells. That history still lives in this city. We can still bring back the old days!}
{194}{}{就在大战之后。看看周围！你知道这个城市是什么吗？这是一个古老思想的纪念碑。那时候，雷诺是由一个叫市长的独裁者统治的。他的随从爬到他的脚下乞求他的宽恕，他的反对者被带到行刑队，无用的梦想家被送到奴隶牢房。这段历史在这座城市依然存在。我们仍然可以回到过去！}
#{195}{}{Is that the only way to bring back the old days? They had other ways of living, before the war.}
{195}{}{这是唯一能让我们回到过去的方法吗？他们在战前有其他的生活方式。}
#{196}{}{Not an option. It's been three generations since the Great War. It's hard to find anyone who remembers the world before. People live... Differently now. They've fallen. Most people would rather submit to the strong, and the few strong people in this town have gone to civil war. That's human nature now. We're not *ready* to go back to those ways. Until we are, we need a strong leader. We need a mayor. We need *me*.}
{196}{}{别无选择。大战已经过去三代了。很难找到一个记得这个世界的人。人活着。。。现在不同了。他们倒下了。大多数人宁愿屈服于强者，而这个镇上少数强者却参加了内战。这就是人性。我们还没有准备好回到过去。在我们成功之前，我们需要一个强有力的领导者。我们需要一个市长。我们需要我。}
#{197}{}{That's a lot of food for thought. I need to reflect on it.}
{197}{}{这是很多值得思考的东西。我需要反思一下。}
#{200}{}{We need to get to the bottom of this. Those lowlifes would have to be pretty stupid to attack my girls. There might be another force pulling the strings. Something's happened to some of my men - I think it might be connected.}
{200}{}{我们得弄清真相。那些卑鄙的人攻击我的女儿一定很愚蠢。可能还有另一种力量在牵线。我手下有些人出事了-我想可能有关系。}
#{201}{}{What happened?}
{201}{}{怎么搞的？}
#{202}{}{Some of our soldiers took fire on the street. I want you to investigate. The survivor's down the hall, start with him. You'll be paid when the investigation's complete.}
{202}{}{我们的一些士兵在街上开枪。我要你调查一下。幸存者在走廊下面，从他开始。调查结束后你会得到报酬的。}
#{203}{}{I'll handle it, Mr. Thompson.}
{203}{}{我来处理，汤普森先生。}
#{204}{}{I've figured out the details of the attack on your people.}
{204}{}{我已经搞清楚了袭击你的人的细节。}
#{205}{}{Tell me everything.}
{205}{}{告诉我一切。}
#{206}{}{According to the evidence I found, the shooter used a silenced sniper rifle from the balcony of a non-residential building in front of the casino entrance. The sniper worked alone and must have been disguised as an ordinary citizen, or he'd have been noticed when he left the building.}
{206}{}{根据我找到的证据，枪手在赌场入口前一栋非住宅楼的阳台上使用了一支沉默的狙击步枪。狙击手独自一人工作，一定是伪装成普通市民，否则他离开大楼时就会被注意到。}
#{207}{}{[He nods] Before the Great War, they called these "false flag" operations. Now it's clear: there's a third group in the city trying to push Stryker and me into an open war. Whoever they are, they're clever, and almost certainly not local. I'd have known of any sniper rifles in these parts.}
{207}{}{[他点头]在大战前，他们称这些行动为“假旗”。现在很清楚了：城里有第三个组织想把史崔克和我推向公开战争。不管他们是谁，他们都很聪明，而且几乎肯定不是本地人。我早就知道这些地方有狙击步枪。}
#{208}{}{Makes sense. These might be mercenaries from another town.}
{208}{}{有道理。他们可能是另一个城镇的雇佣兵。}
#{209}{}{Many of the local business moguls are afraid of us. If they hired mercenaries for sabotage, I'll have to put up my surveillance all over town. The only problem is the caravan parking lot... But before we get into that, we need to settle accounts. [He places a wad of money on the table, then slides it towards you.] For your cooperation, and in expectation of more in the future.}
{209}{}{当地许多商界大亨都怕我们。如果他们雇佣雇佣佣兵进行破坏，我就得在全城设置监视系统。唯一的问题是大篷车停车场。。。但在我们开始之前，我们得先算账。[他把一沓钱放在桌上，然后把它滑向你。]谢谢你的合作，并期待将来能有更多的钱。}
#{210}{}{What was that about the parking lot?}
{210}{}{停车场是怎么回事？}
#{211}{}{Most of the town has been claimed by either Stryker or myself. Only neutral land left is the caravan parking lot... The main entrance into town. The second floor of the local hotel would be perfect for surveillance. Your job is to persuade the hotel owner, Mr. Mordino, to cooperate.}
{211}{}{史崔克和我都占领了小镇的大部分。唯一剩下的中立地是大篷车停车场。。。进城的主要入口。当地酒店的二楼非常适合监视。你的工作是说服旅馆老板摩迪诺先生合作。}
#{212}{}{How... Delicately should I behave during this job?}
{212}{}{怎样。。。我在工作期间应该举止得体吗？}
#{213}{}{That's up to you. My control over this territory must come first. Use any method necessary. But before you make a decision, weigh your options - blackmail, business proposal... Many things can persuade a willful man.}
{213}{}{那由你决定。我必须首先控制这片领土。使用任何必要的方法。但在你做决定之前，权衡一下你的选择――勒索、商业建议。。。许多事情都能说服一个任性的人。}
#{214}{}{I understand, Mr. Thompson. I'll do this as cleanly as possible.}
{214}{}{我明白，汤普森先生。我会尽可能干净利落地做这件事。}
#{215}{}{Hm, that won't be easy. I'll see what I can do.}
{215}{}{嗯，那可不容易。我看看我能做什么。}
#{220}{}{Mordino is dead. Now you can put your own man in charge of the hotel.}
{220}{}{摩迪诺死了。现在你可以让你自己的人来管理酒店了。}
#{221}{}{Hmm. That's not the solution I wanted. It'll be difficult to find someone who can manage the hotel. But that's as secondary concern - now I can take that territory and establish order.}
{221}{}{嗯。那不是我想要的解决办法。很难找到一个能管理这家旅馆的人。但这是第二个问题-现在我可以占领那片领土并建立秩序。}
#{222}{}{[Next]}
{222}{}{[下一步]}
#{223}{}{Good job. Mordino doesn't like risk, so I'm sure he'll be easy to deal with. With his family in our pocket, we can solve this problem. Now, go finish the job.}
{223}{}{干得好。摩迪诺不喜欢冒险，所以我相信他很容易对付。他的家人在我们口袋里，我们可以解决这个问题。现在，去完成这项工作。}
#{224}{}{I'll do it.}
{224}{}{我会的。}
#{225}{}{The job's done. Here's your pay: one thousand dollars, your part of the hotel's income.}
{225}{}{任务完成了。这是你的薪水：一千美元，是你在旅馆收入中的一部分。}
#{226}{}{Thank you, Mr. Thompson.}
{226}{}{谢谢你，汤普森先生。}
#{227}{}{I was able to reach an agreement with Mordino. He's ready to negotiate.}
{227}{}{我和摩迪诺达成了协议。他准备好谈判了。}
#{228}{}{Good work. I'll meet with Mordino personally, but first I'll have my men check all the rooms and hotel staff. I'll need your service.}
{228}{}{干得好。我会亲自与摩迪诺会面，但首先我会让我的人检查所有的房间和酒店员工。我需要你的服务。}
#{229}{}{I feel as if this could have been handled another way... }
{229}{}{我觉得好像可以用另一种方式来处理。。。}
#{230}{}{Justice always requires sacrifice. In our times anyway. Hmm... A year ago, I wouldn't have said that. Reno changes people. It changed you too, didn't it?}
{230}{}{正义总是需要牺牲。在我们这个时代。隐马尔可夫模型。。。一年前，我不会这么说。雷诺改变了人们。它也改变了你，不是吗？}
#{231}{}{Maybe... }
{231}{}{也许 吧。。。}
#{232}{}{Of course, but we haven't dealt with our current task yet.}
{232}{}{当然，但我们还没有处理好当前的任务。}
#{233}{}{I'll handle it myself. This new territory will give me an advantage, but we must drive out Stryker's influence - that means all the snitches and dealers working for him.}
{233}{}{我自己来处理。这片新领地将给我带来优势，但我们必须赶走史崔克的影响――这意味着所有为他工作的告密者和商人。}
#{234}{}{What do I need to do?}
{234}{}{我需要做什么？}
#{235}{}{The others will handle the details. For you, I have important work. I've heard Stryker has a big deal set up, but I don't know the details. Talk to our new scout - he used to patrol the southern wall of Stryker's headquarters. But be careful - he may be a double agent. Give him the code phrase "You're as small as a bug," and do whatever you need to do from there on. Whatever Stryker has planned, you have to stop it.}
{235}{}{其他人会处理细节。对你来说，我有重要的工作。我听说史崔克有个大阴谋，但我不知道细节。和我们的新侦察员谈谈-他曾经巡逻史崔克总部的南墙。但要小心-他可能是双重间谍。给他一个暗语“你像个虫子一样小”，然后从那以后做任何你需要做的事情。不管史崔克有什么计划，你必须阻止它。}
#{236}{}{I'll do it.}
{236}{}{我会的。}
#{237}{}{Stryker's deal has been dealt with.}
{237}{}{史崔克的交易已经处理好了。}
#{238}{}{That's another step forward for us and another step backward for him. His men are already abandoning him. This is good for us, and for Reno. [he hands you a stack of bills] You've earned this.}
{238}{}{这对我们来说是又向前的一步，对他来说是又向后的一步。他的手下已经抛弃了他。这对我们和雷诺都有好处。[他递给你一堆钞票]这是你应得的。}
#{239}{}{What's next?}
{239}{}{下一步是什么？}
#{240}{}{Only one thing remains: the final attack on his headquarters. You don't need to get involved in the fight, my strike team will handle it. Your job is the penetrate their headquarters and disable their monitoring system. This will make them vulnerable and prevent them from calling for backup. Once their defenses are down, meet the head of the strike group in the city park in front of Stryker's headquarters. All clear? I'm not going to repeat it. Get to work!}
{240}{}{只剩下一件事：对他总部的最后一次袭击。你不必参与战斗，我的突击队会处理的。你的工作是渗透他们的总部并关闭他们的监控系统。这将使他们易受攻击，并阻止他们要求备份。一旦他们的防御系统被摧毁，在史崔克总部前的城市公园里与袭击小组的头目会合。一切都好吗？我不会再重复了。开始工作吧！}
#{241}{}{Will do.}
{241}{}{就行了。}
#{242}{}{Stryker is dead. It's time to celebrate your victory!}
{242}{}{史崔克死了。是时候庆祝你的胜利了！}
#{243}{}{[Breathes loudly] This day will go down in the history of New Reno! In honor, let's open a bottle of good old whiskey. Drink with me! You're the only man I can trust.}
{243}{}{这一天将载入新雷诺的历史！为了表示敬意，让我们打开一瓶好的老威士忌。和我一起喝！你是我唯一可以信任的人。}
#{244}{}{Thanks.}
{244}{}{谢谢。}
#{245}{}{From now on, you can openly call yourself my right hand. That's going to mean something in Reno. Everyone under my authority will be happy to work with you, or give you discounts for their services. Keep that in mind.}
{245}{}{从现在起，你可以公开称自己为我的右手。这对雷诺来说意味着什么。在我的职权范围内的每一个人都会很乐意与你合作，或者为他们的服务提供折扣。记住这一点。}
#{246}{}{Great!}
{246}{}{太好了！}
#{247}{}{From here on, it's grunt stuff, not the sort of work I'd give to you. You can relax.}
{247}{}{从现在开始，这是些咕哝的东西，不是我给你的那种工作。你可以放松。}
#{248}{}{And what will you do now?}
{248}{}{你现在要做什么？}
#{249}{}{Right. Goodbye, Mr. Thompson!}
{249}{}{正确的。再见，汤普森先生！}
#{250}{}{Diplomacy, economy, all the work of restoring Reno's old glory. We'll have to rebuild the town hall and recruit more men. Remnants of Stryker's gang will probably keep making trouble - sabotage, assassinations, or just joining the thugs on the street. There's a lot of work in store for me.}
{250}{}{外交，经济，所有恢复雷诺昔日荣耀的工作。我们得重建市政厅，招募更多的人。史崔克团伙的残余分子可能会不断制造麻烦――破坏、暗杀，或者只是加入街头暴徒。我还有很多工作要做。}
#{251}{}{I can help in the coming fight, but I need a better weapon.}
{251}{}{我可以在接下来的战斗中帮忙，但我需要一个更好的武器。}
#{252}{}{Alright. What do you want?}
{252}{}{好吧。你想要什么？}
#{253}{}{[9mm machine gun and 40 rounds]}
{253}{}{[9毫米机枪和40发子弹]}
#{254}{}{[Photon pistol]}
{254}{}{[光子手枪]}
#{255}{}{[8 frag grenades and a combat knife]}
{255}{}{[8枚碎片手榴弹和一把战斗刀]}

#{257}{}{I don't have much hardware. I can't risk giving it out to someone who doesn't know how to use it. I know my strike force is trustworthy, so they get the best equipment.}
{257}{}{我没有多少硬件。我不能冒险把它送给不知道怎么用的人。我知道我的攻击部队是值得信赖的，所以他们有最好的装备。}
#{258}{}{Alright.}
{258}{}{好吧。}
#{259}{}{I'm counting on your help. Take a stimpak, just in case.}
{259}{}{我指望你的帮助。吃点兴奋剂，以防万一。}
#{260}{}{No problem.}
{260}{}{没问题。}
#{300}{}{I represent the Cotton Club. The owner would like to pay you to provide protection for an upcoming concert.}
{300}{}{我代表棉花俱乐部。店主愿意付钱给你，为即将到来的音乐会提供保护。}
#{301}{}{Is that right? That bum can't even pay his fees on time, and now he's throwing a show? Hmm... This would be good to get everything he owes us. Fine, I'll put people on it, but I want half his earnings for the show.}
{301}{}{是这样吗？那个流浪汉连学费都不能按时交，现在却在搞表演？隐马尔可夫模型。。。如果能得到他欠我们的一切就好了。好吧，我会让人参与，但我要他一半的收入。}
#{302}{}{I'll pass it on.}
{302}{}{我把它传下去。}
#{303}{}{Mr. Thompson, we've known each other for a long time. Listen to me: these conditions will bankrupt him. You might get your money now, but if this puts him out of business, you'll never get anything from him again.}
{303}{}{汤普森先生，我们认识很久了。听我说：这些条件会使他破产的。你现在也许能拿到钱，但如果这让他破产，你就再也得不到他的任何东西了。}
#{304}{}{You can set your own price, but think about it: do you want to put pressure a business that's already on the edge? Sure you can set your own price, but think about it - Does it make sense to oppress the almost already bankrupt?}
{304}{}{你可以自己定价，但要想一想：你想给一家已经处于边缘的企业施加压力吗？当然你可以自己定价，但想想看――压迫几乎已经破产的人有意义吗？}
#{305}{}{You make a good point. Fine, I'll take only a quarter of the earnings, but I'm keeping my eye on him.}
{305}{}{你说得对。好吧，我只拿四分之一的收入，但我一直盯着他。}
#{306}{}{Thanks, Mr. Thompson.}
{306}{}{谢谢，汤普森先生。}
#{1110}{}{You have the nerve to show your face here? I had high hopes for you. We could have done so much together. We could have turned this town around! But no, you're a political prostitute, like all the others! I don't need you. Get out!}
{1110}{}{你有勇气在这里露脸？我对你寄予厚望。我们本来可以一起做这么多的。我们本可以扭转这个城市！但不，你和其他人一样，是个政治妓女！我不需要你。走出！}
#{1111}{}{I'll just go, before I spoil your good mood.}
{1111}{}{我要走了，免得破坏你的好心情。}
#{1117}{}{You've got a lot of armed men around here. I want to know more about you.}
{1117}{}{这里有很多武装人员。我想多了解你。}
#{1118}{}{I've seen your posters. I'm interested. Can you tell me about your movement?}
{1118}{}{我看过你的海报。我很感兴趣。你能告诉我你的动作吗？}
#{1144}{}{Is it done?}
{1144}{}{完成了吗？}
#{1158}{}{That's good. I hope you were on your best behavior with Paige. Even to her, we can't show any weakness.}
{1158}{}{那很好。我希望你和佩奇相处得很好。即使对她，我们也不能示弱。}
#{1230}{}{Justice always requires sacrifice. In our times, anyway. Hmm... A year ago, I wouldn't have said that. Reno changes people. It changed you too, didn't it?}
{1230}{}{正义总是需要牺牲。不管怎样，在我们这个时代。隐马尔可夫模型。。。一年前，我不会这么说。雷诺改变了人们。它也改变了你，不是吗？}
#{1243}{}{[Breathes loudly] This day will go down in the history of New Reno! In honor, let's open a bottle of good old whiskey. Drink with me! You're the only one I can trust.}
{1243}{}{这一天将载入新雷诺的历史！为了表示敬意，让我们打开一瓶好的老威士忌。和我一起喝！你是我唯一可以信任的人。}
