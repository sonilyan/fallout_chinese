### {10}{}{[Battered leather armor, definitely smaller in size than it should be, barely covers his wide chest. On top of it, there's a wide spiked collar, decorated with crooked letters, spelling out "Klumk". The armor itself is covered with all kinds of badges, bottlecaps, and shells of a different caliber. The gem of the collection is definitely that "DO NOT ENTER" road sign on his back, covered in bullet holes] What outsider want from Klumk? Klumk make no trade now!}
{10}{}{[破旧的皮甲，尺寸肯定比它应该的要小，几乎盖不住他宽阔的胸部。在它的顶部，有一个宽的尖刺项圈，上面装饰着弯曲的字母，拼写着“Klumk”。盔甲本身覆盖着各种徽章、瓶卡和不同口径的炮弹。该系列的亮点肯定是“请勿进入”他背上的路标，布满了弹孔]局外人想从克鲁姆克那里得到什么？Klumk现在不做交易！}
### {11}{011}{Hey, Klumk. So, you are not interested in fire water and beads?}

{1001}{}{[他摸了摸鼻子里的斗牛环，恶狠狠地看了你一眼]你为什么走得那么快，亲爱的？肉很硬。克鲁姆克不太喜欢这个。。。}
### {101}{012}{I'll remember that. For now, can you answer some questions about your tribe?}
{101}{012}{我会记住的。现在，你能回答一些关于你部落的问题吗？}

### {103}{999}{Great. I'll go walk.}
{103}{999}{太棒了我去散步。}
### {1002}{}{[He pulls his head into shoulders and covers decorations on his armor with hands, as if you want to take them from him] You want fight again? Klumk do not want! Less teeth, bad to chew...}
{1002}{}{[他把头伸进肩膀，用手盖住盔甲上的装饰物，好像你想把它们从他身上拿走]你想再打一次吗？克鲁姆克不要！牙齿少，咀嚼不好。。。}
### {104}{012}{Don't twitch, I just want to ask a few questions about my new home.}

### {1101}{}{[He meaningfully nods, scratching his tanned face, covered in ritual scars, with long nails] Now Klumk go hunt! But Elder know that Klumk smart, she send Klumk to outsiders - exchange prey on things. Klumk keep everything here [he taps his forehead with finger]. Big Ursa hide - five times two knives or one sack of corn, wolf fangs - strong water one bottle... But outsiders not like Klumk offering them beautiful skin once. Nice, with pictures on it! Klumk peel it off an outsider by himself, ate him later! You are so strange, outsiders...}
{1101}{}{[他意味深长地点了点头，用长指甲抓着晒得黝黑的脸，脸上布满了仪式上的疤痕]现在克鲁姆克去打猎了！但埃尔德知道克鲁姆克聪明，她把克鲁姆克送到外人那里――交换猎物的东西。克鲁姆克把所有东西都放在这里[他用手指轻拍额头]。大熊皮――五次两刀或一袋玉米，狼牙――一瓶浓水。。。但局外人不喜欢Klumk曾经给他们提供美丽的皮肤。很好，上面有图片！克鲁姆克一个人把它从一个局外人身上剥下来，然后吃掉了他！你太奇怪了，局外人。。。}

Klumk remember!}

### {122}{999}{So that's how it is. Well, get some rest, I need to go,}
{122}{999}{事情就是这样。好吧，休息一下，我得走了，}


### {130}{}{[He gives you a bewildered look] Because it's COOL! That's what one outsider tell me. I exchange my prey with him all the time. And he teach me to write my name! [he points on his collar] This I did myself! You no talk this to Elder, she yell at me all the time already. And... [he staggers, nervously strumming shells on his armor, but still continues] I like Ptuna. This I buy-wear for her. }
{130}{}{[他困惑地看了你一眼]因为太酷了！这是一个局外人告诉我的。我一直在和他交换猎物。他教我写我的名字！[他指着衣领]这是我自己干的！你不跟长老说这些，她已经对我大喊大叫了。和[他摇摇晃晃，紧张地在盔甲上弹炮弹，但仍在继续]我喜欢普图纳。这是我给她买的衣服。}
### {131}{012}{What can you say about the tribe?}
{131}{012}{关于这个部落你能说些什么？}
### {132}{014}{I'm so sickened by all of you... I'm gonna give you some shells! Don't forget to pull bullets from your head later!}

### {133}{999}{Me go... I mean, I need to go.}
{133}{999}{我走。。。我的意思是，我得走了。}


### {140}{}{[He straightens his shoulders with a quiet howling. His muscles pop out so hard that it looks like the armor would tear it any minute. Klumk looks like rabid Lavash, ring in his nose only emphasizes the similarity.] You threaten me, outsider? I kill you, in front of all tribe! I ask Elder to let me duel and eat your kidney after! No weapon, only fists and teeth!}
{140}{}{[他安静地嚎叫着，挺直了肩膀。他的肌肉非常结实，看起来盔甲随时都会撕裂它。克鲁姆克看起来像疯狂的熔岩，鼻子上的戒指只强调了相似性。]你威胁我，局外人？我杀了你，当着所有部落的面！我请求长老让我决斗，然后吃掉你的肾！没有武器，只有拳头和牙齿！}
### {141}{999}{No problem! I'm always ready for a good warm-up! Gather them!}
{141}{999}{没问题！我随时准备好好热身！召集他们！}
### {142}{999}{I'll break your spine and leave you to die in the pool of your own blood, mutt! Let everyone see this!}
{142}{999}{我会打断你的脊椎，让你死在你自己的血泊里，杂种！让每个人都看到这一点！}
### {143}{998}{I don't like being public... I'm going to dismember you right now!}
{143}{998}{我不喜欢公开。。。我现在就要把你肢解！}


### {150}{}{[Klumk sheds his armor, grabbing some dirt from the ground and making a straight line from shoulder to hip. He starts to slowly approach you, crouching, but still, his face looms over you] Outsider ready to die? Klumk hungry already!}
{150}{}{[克鲁姆克卸下盔甲，从地上抓了一些泥土，从肩膀到臀部画了一条直线。他开始慢慢地靠近你，蹲着，但他的脸仍然笼罩着你]局外人准备好死了吗？克鲁姆克已经饿了！}
### {151}{016}{[rip out the ring from his nose]}
{151}{016}{[把戒指从他鼻子上扯下来]}
### {152}{017}{[remember your martial arts training and punch him with "tiger claw"]}

### {154}{998}{Enough talk. Let's go!}
{154}{998}{说够了。我们走！}


### {160}{}{[A strong and sudden pull - and you have the ring. Klumk, furiously roaring, takes a step back, holding on his torn nostrils and shaking his head]}
{160}{}{[一个强大而突然的拉力――你就有了戒指。克鲁姆克愤怒地咆哮着，后退了一步，抓住撕裂的鼻孔，摇了摇头]}
### {161}{998}{Look what I found! Catch! [throw him the ring and prepare to fight]}
{161}{998}{看看我发现了什么！接住[把戒指扔给他，准备战斗]}


### {170}{}{[Your steel fingers slice through his face. His left eye flows down the cheek, he falls on his knees, howling in pain, stunned, blindly flailing hands around. Then he slowly tries to stand up, shaking, yelling something illegible]}
{170}{}{[你钢铁般的手指划过他的脸。他的左眼顺着脸颊往下流，跪在地上，痛苦地嚎叫，目瞪口呆，盲目地挥舞着双手。然后他慢慢地试图站起来，颤抖着，大喊着一些难以辨认的东西]}
### {171}{998}{Come on, get up. It's only the beginning.}
{171}{998}{来吧，起来。这只是一个开始。}

### {172}{}{I do not want die like that!}
