#{100}{}{You see gravedigger Bob.}
{100}{}{你看到掘墓人鲍勃了。}
#{101}{}{You see a dirty hairy man in old tattered clothes.}
{101}{}{你看到一个脏兮兮的毛茸茸的男人穿着破旧的衣服。}
#{110}{}{[You see a dirty villager, reeking of sweat and alcohol. His head, barely covered with long thin locks of hair, looks oddly shaped; it's as if, when being born, he was pulled out by the skull with forceps, and, when he saw the world he'd have to live in, he grabbed onto whatever he could to keep himself from it.]}
{110}{}{[你看到一个肮脏的村民，浑身是汗和酒的味道。他的头上几乎没有长而细的一绺头发，看上去很奇怪；就好像出生时，他被用镊子从头骨上拔了出来，当他看到他必须生活的世界时，他抓住了他能抓住的任何东西，使自己远离它。]}
#{111}{}{Um, excuse me, who are you?}
{111}{}{呃，打扰一下，你是谁？}
#{112}{}{Don't just stand there, hairy! Are you going to say hi, or what?}
{112}{}{别站在那儿，毛毛！你是想打个招呼，还是怎么了？}
#{113}{}{[He jumps and whirls his dirty face to you, opening his mouth wide, showing the yellow tooth, probably, the only one he has.] Oh, my golly gosh! W-why'd you have to go and sh-care me like that?}
{113}{}{[他跳起来，把他那张脏兮兮的脸对着你，张大嘴巴，露出那颗黄牙，可能是他唯一的一颗。]噢，天哪！你为什么要去关心我？}
#{114}{}{I'm sorry, I didn't mean to! It won't happen again.}
{114}{}{对不起，我不是故意的！不会再发生了。}
#{115}{}{Quit shaking, coward. I asked you a question.}
{115}{}{别发抖了，胆小鬼。我问了你一个问题。}
#{116}{}{Uh, erm... I'm Bob, the local gravedigger and c-carpenter. I'm n-nobody sh-peshial.}
{116}{}{呃，呃...我是鲍勃，当地的掘墓人和c-木匠。我不是什么人。}

#{118}{}{. Nice to meet you, gravedigger Bob.}
{118}{}{. 很高兴见到你，掘墓人鲍勃。}
#{119}{}{I disagree, you're very special. Of all the freaks in this village, you're easily the freakiest.}
{119}{}{我不同意，你很特别。在这个村子里所有的怪胎中，你很容易是最怪胎的。}
#{120}{}{[For a couple of seconds, he numbly glares at you, then extends his muddy hand, smiling wide with his toothless dirty mouth] O-o-oh, it's sho g-good to meet a n-nice pershon! [he looks around with shame in his eyes] S-shorry for the messh. I don't usually h-have visitorsh.}
{120}{}{[有几秒钟，他麻木地瞪着你，然后伸出他那沾满泥浆的手，咧着他没有牙齿的脏嘴微笑]噢，见到一个很好的人真是太好了！[他满眼羞耻地环顾四周]快去收拾烂摊子。我通常没有访客。}
#{121}{}{Don't worry about it. Can you answer a few questions?}
{121}{}{别担心。你能回答几个问题吗？}
#{122}{}{[He mumbles something inaudible under his nose] ...like everyone. Why would they... Dish-gushting little... }
{122}{}{[他在鼻子底下咕哝着什么听不见的东西]…像所有人一样。为什么他们会...盘子里有点喷...}
#{123}{}{Don't mumble at me. I need answers, and it's unpleasant enough talking to you as it is.}
{123}{}{别对我咕哝。我需要答案，现在跟你说话已经够不愉快的了。}
#{124}{}{I - I don't know anyshing. I only make c-coffinsh. And - and dig g-gravesh... }
{124}{}{我-我什么都不知道。我只做棺材。还有-挖坟墓...}
#{125}{}{Then I'm wasting my time. I'm getting out of here.}
{125}{}{那我就是在浪费时间。我要离开这里。}
#{126}{}{Then you must have time to talk, right?}
{126}{}{那你一定有时间谈谈，对吧？}
#{130}{}{H-hey! Are... A-are you the one who'sh been r-robbing the gravesh?}
{130}{}{嘿-嘿！是...你就是那个抢坟墓的人吗？}
#{131}{}{Who, me? No, I'd never do that.}
{131}{}{谁，我？不，我不会那样做的。}
#{132}{}{If you tell anyone, I'll be looting your corpse next. Got it?}
{132}{}{如果你告诉任何人，下一步我会洗劫你的尸体。知道了？}
#{150}{}{Huh, what?}
{150}{}{嗯，什么？}
#{151}{}{Nothing, calm down.}
{151}{}{没事，冷静。}
#{152}{}{What's that awful smell?}
{152}{}{那难闻的气味是什么？}
#{153}{}{Don't you feel lonely all the way out here by yourself?}
{153}{}{你一个人一路上不觉得孤独吗？}
#{154}{}{Tell me about Black Rock.}
{154}{}{告诉我关于黑岩的事。}
#{155}{}{[He looks around, then sniffs his dirty clothes] Oh... It'sh... Me, I guessh... }
{155}{}{[他环顾四周，然后闻了闻他的脏衣服]哦...这是...我，我想...}
#{156}{}{I... I d-don't like crowd-sh, and, uh... And people don't like to be around a g-gravedigger. That's j-jusht... Jusht how it ish... }
{156}{}{一、 ...我不喜欢拥挤，还有，呃...而且人们不喜欢和掘墓人在一起。那是j-jusht...这是多么的...}
#{157}{}{Uh... I don't know... It's p-peasheful. Jushtin doeshn't want to - to let anybody in, but... But that'sh how we all got here.}
{157}{}{Uh...我不知道...真是太棒了。朱什丁不想让任何人进来，但是...但我们就是这样来到这里的。}
#{160}{}{Who is that coffin outside for?}
{160}{}{外面的棺材是给谁的？}
#{161}{}{[He sighs shakily] It'sh for... It'sh for Jed. He s-shaid he'sh going to... To d-die shoon. But he'sh been sh-aying that for a long time. Ushually, when shomeone d-diesh, we jusht wrap them in rag-sh, but Sh-mith is... Sh-mith is sh-pecial.}
{161}{}{[他颤抖地叹息]这是为了...是给杰德的。他说他会...去死吧。但他已经说了很久了。通常情况下，当我们把它们包起来的时候，我们会把它们用破布包起来，但它是...希米特是特殊的。}
#{162}{}{Let??s talk about something else.}
{162}{}{我们再谈点别的吧。}
#{163}{}{Smith, you traveled a long way to come here, and now you will stay here forever.}
{163}{}{史密斯，你远道而来，现在你将永远留在这里。}
#{164}{}{This place hurt you, but... }
{164}{}{这个地方伤害了你，但是...}
#{165}{}{... But you conquered it. And... Started new life here.}
{165}{}{... 但你征服了它。还有...在这里开始了新的生活。}
#{166}{}{We will never forget you.}
{166}{}{我们永远不会忘记你。}
#{167}{}{Rest in peace. You earned it. Amen.}
{167}{}{安息吧。这是你应得的。阿门。}
#{168}{}{Now let's hit the bar!}
{168}{}{现在我们去酒吧吧！}
#{169}{}{It looks like Jed is dead.}
{169}{}{看来杰德死了。}
#{170}{}{What happened to Smith?}
{170}{}{史密斯怎么了？}
#{171}{}{It wazh... It wazh a normal day. Uzhual weazher. He wazh outshide, l-looking up at the shky, and... And jusht... He jusht fell ash-leep. [he wipes his eyes with a dirty sleeve] Oh, man, he... He wazh the only man I've ever sheen that died by natural caushes.}
{171}{}{它是wazh...这是正常的一天。乌兹瓦尔・韦哲尔。他躲在外面，我抬头看着那个胆小鬼，然后...还有朱斯特...他突然睡着了。[他用脏袖子擦眼睛]哦，天哪，他...他是我见过的唯一一个死于自然原因的人。}
#{180}{}{How do you feel about Jasmine?}
{180}{}{你觉得茉莉花怎么样？}
#{181}{}{[He smiles crookedly] She... Well, she's a... S-she'sh a good girl. I'd talk to her, but... But I'm afraid to. She's infectioush. What would p-people shay? No, I'm... I'm fine being alone.}
{181}{}{她...她是个...她是个好女孩。我想和她谈谈，但是...但我不敢。她有传染性。p-people shay会怎么做？不，我...我一个人很好。}
#{182}{}{Would you like to live with her?}
{182}{}{你愿意和她住在一起吗？}
#{183}{}{Me?! Oh, yesh! Yesh, I'd love to!}

{184}{}{我会记住的。}
#{185}{}{I want to talk to you about Jasmine.}
{185}{}{我想和你谈谈茉莉花。}
#{186}{}{I told you, it... It would be pos-shible, if she w-weren't shick.}
{186}{}{我告诉过你，它...如果她不恶心的话，那就糟了。}
#{187}{}{Really? Ohh, that's awkward. She told me she thinks your mother shat herself while giving birth and kept the wrong pile, that you rape the corpses you get and eat what remains, and that they made her fuck dogs in Reno but you helped her get over it, because the thought of touching you puts it all in perspective.}
{187}{}{真正地？哦，太尴尬了。她告诉我，她认为你母亲在分娩时把自己弄碎了，把那堆东西放错了，你强奸了你得到的尸体，吃了剩下的东西，他们在里诺给她做了狗，但你帮她克服了，因为一想到碰你，就把一切都看清楚了。}
#{188}{}{I cured her infection. She wants to start a family, Bob. Are you interested?}
{188}{}{我治好了她的感染。她想成家，鲍勃。你有兴趣吗？}
#{189}{}{Alright, forget it.}
{189}{}{好吧，算了吧。}
#{190}{}{What?! [his voice raises to a shriek] Why?! Why me?! What did I ever do? Sho, maybe I shtink a little and I have bad teesh - well who doeshn't around here? What a tramp she turned out to be... She hershelf looksh like she crawled out from shome dumpshter. I'll never talk to her again!}
{190}{}{什么？！为什么？！为什么是我？！我做过什么？嘘，也许我喝了一点，而且我的牙也不好――好吧，谁不在这呢？她原来是个流浪汉...她看起来像是从垃圾堆里爬出来的。我再也不和她说话了！}
#{191}{}{Should I go tell her that?}
{191}{}{我应该去告诉她吗？}
#{192}{}{Yesh! Oh, golly-golly! N-no, I can't shcrew this up. I'll do it! It'sh my l-lasht chance. Ahh, I - I have to get ready, really good!}
{192}{}{是的！哦，天哪，天哪！不，我不能把这件事搞砸。我会的！这是我最后的机会。啊，我-我得准备好了，真的很好！}
#{193}{}{Think about it. I'll go talk to her.}
{193}{}{好好想想。我去和她谈谈。}
#{194}{}{Bob, I can help you with her... }
{194}{}{鲍勃，我可以帮你照顾她...}

{201}{}{不！他们在撒谎！他们都在撒谎，这不是真的！不是的！}
#{202}{}{Hey, you can tell me, Bob. One gravedigger to another.}
{202}{}{嘿，你可以告诉我，鲍勃。从一个掘墓人到另一个掘墓人。}
#{203}{}{Fine, forget it.}
{203}{}{好吧，算了吧。}
#{204}{}{N-nobody trusht-sh you around here, you know that. Why should I?}
{204}{}{你知道的，没人在这耍你。我为什么要这么做？}
#{205}{}{Fine, forget it.}
{205}{}{好吧，算了吧。}
