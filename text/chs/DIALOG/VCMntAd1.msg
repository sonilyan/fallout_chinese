#{102}{}{*Error completing script!*}
{102}{}{*完成脚本时出错！*}
#{110}{}{No! I ain't going nowhere! [covers his face with hands, like expecting a blow]}
{110}{}{不！我哪也不去！[用手捂住他的脸，像是在期待打击]}
#{111}{}{Calm down, I'm not here after you.}
{111}{}{冷静点，我不是来找你的。}
#{112}{}{Well-well! Hiding from someone, am I right?}
{112}{}{好吧，好吧！躲着别人，对吗？}
#{113}{}{As you wish, I'm leaving.}
{113}{}{如你所愿，我要走了。}
#{114}{}{Ohh... Sorry, I thought you were after me... Er... Alright, never mind.}
{114}{}{哦。。。对不起，我以为你在找我。。。呃。。。好吧，没关系。}
#{115}{}{Are you hiding from someone?}
{115}{}{你在躲谁吗？}
#{116}{}{Alright.}
{116}{}{好吧。}
#{117}{}{Oh nah... Err... I mean yeah. [grabs you by your clothes and begins shaking hysterically] You must help me! Someone wants to kill me!!! I don't wanna to die!!! Shit, I don't fucking wanna die!!! A-a-a!!!}
{117}{}{哦，不。。。呃。。。我是说是的。[抓住你的衣服开始歇斯底里地颤抖]你必须帮助我！有人想杀了我！！！我不想死！！！妈的，我他妈的不想死！！！A-A-A！！！}
#{118}{}{Hands off, vermin! Get away!}
{118}{}{别插手，害虫！逃掉！}
#{119}{}{[Smack him across his head]}
{119}{}{[打他的头]}
#{120}{}{Alright, alright! Calm down! No need to make a scene!}
{120}{}{好吧，好吧！冷静！不用闹了！}
#{121}{}{Calm down and tell me everything.}
{121}{}{冷静下来，把一切都告诉我。}
#{122}{}{[Struggle out of his grip and leave]}
{122}{}{[挣扎着离开他的控制]}
#{123}{}{Oh yes... Of course... Sorry... I don't know what came over me... I'm alright...}
{123}{}{哦，是的。。。当然。。。对不起的。。。我不知道我是怎么想的。。。我很好。。。}
#{124}{}{Let's just calmly discuss what happened right now?}
{124}{}{让我们冷静地讨论一下现在发生了什么？}
#{125}{}{What the hell was that?! What's with the panic?}
{125}{}{那到底是什么？！恐慌是怎么回事？}
#{126}{}{None of my business. I'm outta here.}
{126}{}{不关我的事。我要走了。}
#{127}{}{Of course... Of course...}
{127}{}{当然。。。当然。。。}
#{128}{}{Tell me your story.}
{128}{}{告诉我你的故事。}
#{129}{}{Erm, well... It's all rather stupid really. I lost a few rounds of cards to one of those skull crushers downstairs. Without anything to put on the table, I bet my adrenal gland... Shit. I'm so, so stupid!!!}
{129}{}{呃，好吧。。。真是太蠢了。我丢了几张牌给楼下的碎骨工。没有东西放在桌子上，我打赌我的肾上腺。。。倒霉。我太，太蠢了！！！}
#{130}{}{Hold on... You lost your adrenal gland on a bet?!}
{130}{}{等等。。。你赌输了肾上腺？！}
#{131}{}{Err, what the hell is that?}
{131}{}{呃，那到底是什么？}
#{132}{}{Can you even live without it?}
{132}{}{没有它你还能活吗？}
#{133}{}{Why does anyone even need somebody else's adrenal gland?}
{133}{}{为什么有人需要别人的肾上腺？}
#{134}{}{Who did you lose to?}
{134}{}{你输给谁了？}
#{135}{}{What are you gonna do now?}
{135}{}{你现在打算怎么办？}
#{136}{}{Can I help?}
{136}{}{我能帮忙吗？}
#{137}{}{Ugh, not my problem. I'm going.}
{137}{}{呃，不是我的问题。我要走了。}
#{138}{}{Stay here while I figure this out.}
{138}{}{待在这里等我弄清楚。}
#{139}{}{The adrenal gland is a paired organ producing adrenaline and other hormones. You can live without one, but why would anyone even need yours?}
{139}{}{肾上腺是一对产生肾上腺素和其他激素的器官。你可以没有它生活，但为什么有人需要你的呢？}
#{140}{}{Yeah, that was about the worst decision in my life! And, looks like the last too... But the cards... I just couldn't help myself.}
{140}{}{是啊，那是我一生中最糟糕的决定！而且，看起来也是最后一个。。。但是卡片。。。我就是忍不住。}
#{141}{}{Adrenal gland. It's the gland above the kidneys that produces adrenaline and some other stuff. A very... Expensive thing.}
{141}{}{肾上腺。是肾脏上方的腺体产生肾上腺素和其他物质。一个非常。。。昂贵的东西。}
#{142}{}{I heard that it's survivable. But, I don't know... Most likely... I'll end up as a stiff.}
{142}{}{我听说它可以生存。但是，我不知道。。。很可能。。。我会变成一个呆子。}
#{143}{}{Oh, don't you know?! You need it for adrenochrome. It's the most... Hellish drug in the history of mankind! It takes only a few drops of extract from this gland to just keel over. First you lose control over your own muscles, the body begins burn up. You're covered with a layer of sweat. And then the hallucinations come - your head will swell up like a watermelon... You gain about two hundred pounds in two hours, grow claws, bleeding warts... And then you notice about six huge, hairy tits swelling up on your back. You'll go blind, your body turns to wax, they'll have to put you in a wheelbarrow... And when you scream for help you sound like a raccoon... That's what I was told at least. I've never tried it myself.}
{143}{}{哦，你不知道吗？！你需要它来做肾上腺素红。这是最。。。人类历史上最可怕的毒品！只需从腺体中滴几滴提取物就可以完全恢复。首先你失去了对自己肌肉的控制，身体开始燃烧。你浑身是汗。然后幻觉来了-你的头会像西瓜一样肿起来。。。你在两个小时内增加了两百磅，长出爪子，流血疣。。。然后你注意到大约六个巨大的毛茸茸的乳头在你的背上隆起。你会失明，你的身体会变成蜡，他们会把你放在手推车里。。。当你尖叫求救的时候，你听起来就像只浣熊。。。至少有人告诉我。我自己从没试过。}
#{144}{}{The thug named David. He's downstairs right now, waiting for me near the exit.}
{144}{}{那个叫大卫的暴徒。他现在在楼下，在出口附近等我。}
#{145}{}{Oh I don't know. I think I'll just stay here until I die of hunger. I'm not leaving the casino - David and the other bouncers will be waiting for me near the exit. They'll just butcher me in the nearest room as soon as they see me! Oh... Oh god!!!}
{145}{}{哦，我不知道。我想我会一直呆在这里直到饿死。我不会离开赌场-大卫和其他保镖会在出口附近等我。他们一看到我就在最近的房间里宰了我！哦。。。哦上帝！！！}
#{146}{}{I don't know what to do! The front door is watched, and the backdoor is locked! You can't slip while the guards are watching. There are no other ways out. The only thing left is to surrender to David.}
{146}{}{我不知道该怎么办！前门被监视，后门被锁上！你不能在警卫监视的时候滑倒。没有别的出路了。唯一剩下的就是向大卫投降。}
#{150}{}{Oh... Whew, thank god it's you, I was scared for a moment.}
{150}{}{哦。。。噢，感谢上帝，是你，我吓了一跳。}
#{151}{}{Tell me what happened again.}
{151}{}{告诉我又发生了什么事。}
#{152}{}{I know what to do!}
{152}{}{我知道该怎么办！}
#{153}{}{Stay here.}
{153}{}{呆在这里。}
#{154}{}{What, really?! What do you mean?!}
{154}{}{什么，真的？！你什么意思？}
#{155}{}{Get up! David will reward me for your adrenal.}
{155}{}{起床！大卫会报答我的。}
#{156}{}{I'll get you through the backdoor.}
{156}{}{我带你从后门过去。}
#{157}{}{I'm a doctor and I can remove your adrenal without risk to your health.}
{157}{}{我是医生，我可以切除你的肾上腺而不影响你的健康。}
#{158}{}{How was the deal made? On paper or just by word?}
{158}{}{交易是怎么达成的？写在纸上还是用文字？}
#{159}{}{Will David accept something other than your adrenal?}
{159}{}{大卫会接受除你之外的东西吗？}
#{160}{}{I could just kill him.}
{160}{}{我可以杀了他。}
#{161}{}{Nothing, sorry.}
{161}{}{没什么，对不起。}
#{162}{}{Oh no, guess this is the end of the road...}
{162}{}{哦，不，我猜这是路的尽头。。。}
#{163}{}{Quit pissing yourself and get to David! I'll make sure you don't try and run.}
{163}{}{别小便了，去找大卫！我会确保你不会逃跑。}
#{164}{}{I was just kidding, you can calm down.}
{164}{}{我只是开玩笑，你可以冷静下来。}
#{165}{}{It's going to be hard. The backdoor is always locked, and it's unlikely to break it down without causing any noise. If they were unlocked, I could quickly run outside. The cops wouldn't let anything happen to me... I hope.}
{165}{}{会很难的。后门总是锁着的，不可能在不引起任何噪音的情况下把它打开。如果没有锁，我可以很快跑出去。警察不会让我出事的。。。希望如此。}
#{166}{}{Get ready, we're going! I took care of the door. Move! Move!}
{166}{}{准备好，我们要走了！我把门关好了。快走！快走！}
#{167}{}{Wait here then.}
{167}{}{那就在这儿等着。}
#{168}{}{There's another option.}
{168}{}{还有另一个选择。}
#{169}{}{Erm... If you're really a doctor, then I'd rather let you operate on me, but... You just don't look like a surgeon!}
{169}{}{呃。。。如果你真的是个医生，我宁愿让你给我做手术，但是。。。你看起来不像个外科医生！}
#{170}{}{Erm... If you're really a doctor, then I'd rather let you operate on me... Yeah, something about you strikes me as doctor-ish. But you won't put me under the scalpel without painkillers, will you?}
{170}{}{呃。。。如果你真的是个医生，那我宁愿让你给我做手术。。。是啊，我觉得你是个医生。但是如果没有止痛药，你不会把我放在手术刀下吧？}
#{171}{}{I've got a strong anesthetic with me. Now, let's go to a free room. Don't be scared, you'll live!}
{171}{}{我身上有很强的麻醉剂。现在，我们去一个免费的房间。别害怕，你会活下来的！}
#{172}{}{On paper. We both signed it. Then he folded it up and stuck it in the back of his pants. If it wasn't for that paper, I could ask the cops for help!.. Or at least try.}
{172}{}{在纸上。我们都签了名。然后他把它折起来，塞在裤子后面。如果不是那份报纸，我可以向警察求助！。。或者至少试试。}
#{173}{}{I got the paper. Here it is.}
{173}{}{我拿到报纸了。给你。}
#{174}{}{That gland costs a huge amount of money. Not completely sure, but it's *at least* a few thousand bucks.}
{174}{}{那腺体花了一大笔钱。不完全确定，但至少要几千美元。}
#{175}{}{Kill David?! Are you suicidal?! David is one of the casino employees, the whole security force will be at his back.}
{175}{}{杀了大卫？！你想自杀吗？！大卫是赌场的雇员之一，整个保安部队都会支持他。}
#{176}{}{The man you owed is dead.}
{176}{}{你欠的那个人死了。}
#{177}{}{Oh god! How did you do it?! Actually... I don't care. I'm not stepping another foot in this place!}
{177}{}{哦，上帝！你怎么做到的？！事实上。。。我不在乎。我不会再踏进这个地方了！}
#{178}{}{Correct. Time to get out.}
{178}{}{对的。是时候出去了。}
#{180}{}{David: Hah! Look who we have here! Norman! Our dear client. I was afraid we'd have to look for you in all those rooms upstairs.}
{180}{}{大卫：哈！看看我们这里有谁！诺曼！我们亲爱的客户。我怕我们得在楼上那些房间里找你。}
#{181}{}{[Continue]}
{181}{}{[继续]}
#{182}{}{Norman: Erm, of course... Err, I decided not to bother your security...}
{182}{}{诺曼：嗯，当然。。。呃，我决定不打扰你的安全。。。}
#{183}{}{David: Shut up! That was your last trick. Try and run again... I'll blow your kneecaps off!}
{183}{}{大卫：闭嘴！那是你最后的把戏。再次尝试运行。。。我要炸掉你的膝盖骨！}
#{184}{}{Norman: Yes... Err, yes sir...}
{184}{}{诺曼：是的。。。呃，是的，先生。。。}
#{185}{}{David: Thanks for your help, wanderer. This client has owed us quite a sum of money, so here's your reward - $300. And... All the best.}
{185}{}{大卫：谢谢你的帮助，流浪者。这个客户欠我们不少钱，所以这是你的报酬――300美元。还有。。。祝你一切顺利。}
#{186}{}{Pleasure doing business with you.}
{186}{}{很高兴和你做生意。}
#{187}{}{... Erm, hold on! Hm... I heard that our boss, Hal Wallace, is looking for someone for a rather lucrative job. If you're looking for profit in this city, you might want to talk to him. Tell the guard you're from me and he'll let you through.}
{187}{}{... 呃，等等！嗯。。。我听说我们的老板哈尔・华莱士正在找一个相当有利可图的工作。如果你想在这个城市谋利，你可能想和他谈谈。告诉警卫你是我的，他会让你过去的。}
#{188}{}{Great! Take care!}
{188}{}{太好了！当心！}
#{189}{}{}
{189}{}{}
#{190}{}{Oh god, we're out! I thought I was gonna end up like a stuck pig in one of the rooms. Thank you, wanderer, I owe you my life. Unfortunately, I can't pay you back. I got into this shit because I'm broke. But, if we see each other again, maybe I could help you like you helped me.}
{190}{}{天哪，我们出局了！我以为我会像一头被困在其中一个房间里的猪。谢谢你，流浪汉，我欠你一条命。很遗憾，我不能还你钱。我是因为破产才惹上麻烦的。但是，如果我们再见面，也许我可以像你帮助我一样帮助你。}
#{191}{}{What are you gonna do now?}
{191}{}{你现在打算怎么办？}
#{192}{}{Well, I'm not staying in this city, that's for sure! That bonehead is just gonna send his skull crushers after me and then I'll get butchered in the streets. And the law will be on his side as well. I need to disappear as soon as I can!}
{192}{}{好吧，我肯定不会待在这个城市的！那个笨蛋只会派他的碎骨机来追我，然后我就在街上被宰了。法律也会站在他的一边。我要尽快消失！}
#{193}{}{Which way?}
{193}{}{哪条路？}
#{194}{}{Not sure yet, I'll need to think about it. Anything will do, as long as it's far away from here!}
{194}{}{还不确定，我需要考虑一下。什么都可以，只要离这儿远一点！}
#{195}{}{Understood. In that case, good luck.}
{195}{}{理解。那样的话，祝你好运。}
#{196}{}{Hold on, what did you say about drugs in the city?}
{196}{}{等等，你怎么说城里的毒品？}
#{197}{}{Not like it's a secret, but a few know. I hear that somewhere not far away from the city exists a hidden lab that makes hallucinogens and other chems. Supposedly, that's where the most part of the city's dope comes from. But I've never been there.}
{197}{}{不是什么秘密，但有几个人知道。我听说离这座城市不远的地方有一个隐藏的实验室，制造迷幻剂和其他化学物质。据推测，这就是这个城市大部分毒品的来源。但我从没去过那里。}
#{198}{}{Alright, rumors are helpful too. Good luck.}
{198}{}{好吧，谣言也很有用。祝你好运。}
#{199}{}{}

#{201}{}{[Continue.]}
{201}{}{[继续。]}
#{202}{}{Norman: Yes, of course... But there's one thing. I want this man to operate on me.}
{202}{}{诺曼：是的，当然。。。但有一件事。我要这个人给我动手术。}
#{203}{}{Yes, that is so.}
{203}{}{是的，就是这样。}
#{204}{}{[David looks at you with an empty gaze before shrugging] I don't care who pulls my property out of you.}
{204}{}{[大卫在耸耸肩前空洞地看着你]我不在乎谁从你这里拿走我的财产。}
#{205}{}{Let us begin.}
{205}{}{让我们开始吧。}
#{206}{}{Well, Norman, looks like this party is over.}
{206}{}{嗯，诺曼，看来派对结束了。}
#{207}{}{Ughh, you son of a bitch...}
{207}{}{啊，你这狗娘养的。。。}
#{208}{}{Heh-heh-heh!!!}
{208}{}{呵呵呵呵！！！}
#{209}{}{You receive 1000 exp for successfully completing the operation.}
{209}{}{成功完成操作将获得1000 exp。}
#{210}{}{What's wrong David, lost something?}
{210}{}{怎么了大卫，丢了什么东西？}
#{211}{}{Hah! Look who suddenly grew a pair...}
{211}{}{哈哈！看谁突然长出一双。。。}
#{212}{}{Don't even dare to touch me!}
{212}{}{别碰我！}
#{213}{}{Ugh... Fuck it. You won't get far.}
{213}{}{呃。。。去他妈的。你走不了多远。}
#{214}{}{We'll see about that... Let's go!!!}
{214}{}{我们拭目以待。。。走吧！！！}
