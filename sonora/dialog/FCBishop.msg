### {201}{}{Why is that?}
{201}{}{为什么？}
### {202}{}{Flagstaff is one of the few places in the wastelands where order is accepted... in a way. Some outsiders in this city are condemned to forced labor, and some to the death penalty in order to become fuel for the Sacred Fire. But ultimately it's up to you.}
{202}{}{弗拉格斯塔夫是荒原上为数不多的接受订单的地方之一。。。在某种程度上这个城市的一些外来者被判处强迫劳动，一些人被判处死刑，以成为圣火的燃料。但最终取决于你。}

{227}{}{哦，毫无疑问。但恐怕在得到主寺的同意之前，我不能接受你作为信仰上的兄弟。也就是说，你必须付钱。你会读书吗？}

# About faith
### {245}{}{Tell us about your faith.}
{245}{}{告诉我们你的信仰。}
### {246}{}{I can talk about this forever. The world was created by the Sacred Fire that fell to earth a hundred years ago. He incinerated the sinful people and left only small families for the human race to continue its existence.}

### {251}{}{I thought it was a war.}
{251}{}{我以为这是一场战争。}
### {252}{}{This is the trouble of many living people. You have lost faith in the soul and have condescended to simple material truths. The Great War is only a disguise of what the Sacred Fire was. It was not nuclear bombs that punished humanity, but human stupidity and greed. That's the point.}
{252}{}{这是许多活着的人的烦恼。你对灵魂失去了信心，屈尊于简单的物质真理。伟大的战争只是神圣之火的伪装。惩罚人类的不是核弹，而是人类的愚蠢和贪婪。这就是重点。}
### {253}{}{How far has your faith spread?}
{253}{}{你的信仰传播了多远？}
### {254}{}{Our main temple is in Phoenix, but it's not that important. After all, many tribes carry faith in the Sacred Fire, calling It by other names and interpreting ancient events differently. That's why our church is expanding so easily. Our teaching is known throughout Sonora.}
{254}{}{我们的主庙在凤凰城，但没那么重要。毕竟，许多部落都对圣火抱有信仰，用其他名字称呼它，并以不同的方式解释古代事件。这就是为什么我们的教会如此容易扩张的原因。我们的教学在整个索诺拉州都很有名。}
### {255}{}{How do the colonists relate to this faith?}
{255}{}{殖民者与这种信仰有何联系？}
### {256}{}{Most of the inhabitants believe in the Sacred Fire or pretend to believe. But alas, Faber's mercenaries are mostly godless, and there are skeptics among the population. Do not worry, the Sacred Fire will open their eyes sooner or later. I am more concerned about those who are hiding from His X-ray vision.}
{256}{}{大多数居民相信或假装相信圣火。但遗憾的是，费伯的雇佣兵大多是无神的，民众中也有怀疑论者。别担心，圣火迟早会睁开他们的眼睛。我更关心那些躲在他的X光视野之外的人。}
