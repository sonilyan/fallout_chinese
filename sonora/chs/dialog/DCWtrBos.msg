### {100}{}{This is John Sullivan.}
{100}{}{我是约翰・沙利文。}
### {101}{}{You see a person who inspires respect. It looks very clean and well-groomed.}
{101}{}{你看到的是一个值得尊敬的人。它看起来非常干净整洁。}
### {102}{}{You're not going to wander around in this, are you?}
{102}{}{你不会在这里闲逛吧？}
### {103}{}{Are you tired of living? Get out of town, you damned highway guy.}
{103}{}{你厌倦了生活吗？滚出去，你这个该死的高速公路家伙。}

# Before repair
### {200}{}{Hey, stranger. I don't like it when outsiders get in my territory.}
{200}{}{嘿，陌生人。我不喜欢外人进入我的地盘。}
### {1200}{}{Oh, lady, what a surprise to see a lady here. Although I usually don't like it when outsiders get in my territory.}
{1200}{}{哦，女士，在这里看到一位女士真是令人惊讶。尽管我通常不喜欢外人进入我的领地。}
### {201}{}{Is this your water pump? Do you own it?}
{201}{}{这是你的水泵吗？你拥有它吗？}
### {202}{}{Exactly. I'm John Sullivan. And I own this whole station. Do you have business with me? If not, then go outside. I need to fix this filter, not chat with strangers.}
{202}{}{确切地我是约翰・沙利文。我拥有整个电视台。你和我有生意吗？如果没有，那就到外面去。我需要修复这个过滤器，而不是和陌生人聊天。}
### {203}{}{Sorry to bother you. I will leave immediately.}
{203}{}{很抱歉打扰你。我马上就走。}
### {204}{}{I'm new here. Can I ask you a couple of questions about the city?}
{204}{}{我是新来的。我能问你几个关于这个城市的问题吗？}
### {205}{}{Do I speak softly? I DON't HAVE TIME to chat with you.}
{205}{}{我说话轻声细语吗？我没有时间和你聊天。}
### {206}{}{Oh, then I'll leave you immediately.}
{206}{}{哦，那我马上就离开你。}
### {207}{}{And who would I talk to about the city?}
{207}{}{我会和谁谈论这座城市？}
### {208}{}{Old Bustos, his mansion is down the road.}
{208}{}{老巴斯托斯，他的豪宅就在这条路上。}
### {209}{}{Thank you. Goodbye.}
{209}{}{非常感谢。再见}
### {210}{}{Why not give it to repair?}
{210}{}{为什么不把它修理一下呢？}
### {211}{}{Is there really no one else to fix it?}
{211}{}{真的没有其他人来解决吗？}
### {212}{}{The tinsmiths charge us three skins for any service. They know that water is a profitable business, but we can't give them everything. And apart from the tinkerers, no one can handle this kind of work. Only they have working machines and the necessary skills.}
{212}{}{锡匠们为我们提供任何服务都要收三张皮。他们知道水是有利可图的生意，但我们不能给他们一切。除了修修补补的人，没有人能胜任这种工作。只有他们有工作机器和必要的技能。}
### {213}{}{Oh, I'm sorry, then I won't interfere.}
{213}{}{哦，对不起，那我就不干涉了。}
### {214}{}{And you hope to fix it with your own hands?}
{214}{}{你希望用自己的双手来修复它？}
### {215}{}{Sometimes it succeeds. This is one of the filters, it's just clogged with dirt... Or not.}
{215}{}{有时它会成功。这是其中一个过滤器，它只是被污垢堵塞了。。。或者不是。}
### {216}{}{I can fix it.}
{216}{}{我能修好。}
### {217}{}{Really? If you fix the filter, I'll pay. Less than the tinsmiths, of course. But in the end, everyone will win.}
{217}{}{真正地如果你修理过滤器，我会付钱的。当然，比打铁的还少。但最终，每个人都会赢。}
### {218}{}{Wait for the results. It will take some time.}
{218}{}{等待结果。这需要一些时间。}
### {219}{}{Hmm, the technology is too complicated for me. I'm afraid I can't do it.}
{219}{}{嗯，技术对我来说太复杂了。恐怕我做不到。}
### {220}{}{You again? What is it this time?}
{220}{}{你又来了？这次是什么？}
### {221}{}{No, nothing.}
{221}{}{不，什么都没有。}
### {222}{}{About the pump. Why not give it to repair?}
{222}{}{关于泵。为什么不把它修理一下呢？}
### {223}{}{The filter is fine. Dirt and sand ruined some parts, but I managed to restore them.}
{223}{}{过滤器很好。泥土和沙子毁坏了一些零件，但我设法把它们修复了。}
### {224}{}{I love diligence in people. It's not a pity to pay for such work. Take it, there are 200 caps here.}
{224}{}{我喜欢人的勤奋。为这样的工作付钱并不可惜。拿着，这里有200顶帽子。}
### {225}{}{Thank you.}
{225}{}{非常感谢。}
### {226}{}{That's too little.}
{226}{}{这太少了。}
### {227}{}{You've had enough. For a large sum, I wouldn't offer you this job at all.}
{227}{}{你受够了。为了一大笔钱，我根本不会给你这份工作。}
### {228}{}{What a miser you are.}
{228}{}{你真是个吝啬鬼。}
### {229}{}{Thanks anyway.}
{229}{}{无论如何，谢谢。}
### {230}{}{This amount barely bottlecaps the cost of additional details.}
{230}{}{这个数额几乎无法弥补额外细节的成本。}
### {231}{}{Then here are 50 more caps. And don't ask any more.}
{231}{}{还有50顶帽子。不要再问了。}
### {232}{}{What a miser you are.}
{232}{}{你真是个吝啬鬼。}
### {233}{}{That's enough, thank you.}
{233}{}{够了，谢谢。}

### {234}{}{I'm looking for a tinker. Was there one here?}
{234}{}{我在找修补匠。这里有一个吗？}
### {235}{}{Yes, I was. Silently inspected the station, discussed minor repairs and went to the mayor. I haven't seen him since.}
{235}{}{是的，我是。默默地视察了车站，讨论了小修事宜，然后去找市长。从那以后我再也没见过他。}
### {236}{}{Thanks, I'll go ask the mayor.}
{236}{}{谢谢，我去问市长。}
### {237}{}{I'm actually chasing slaves. They were being taken to Two-Sun.}
{237}{}{我其实是在追逐奴隶。他们被带到两个太阳。}
### {238}{}{Well, go to Two-Sun. Why are you asking me? Our business is small - serve the caravan and let it go on all four sides. It's just business.}
{238}{}{好吧，去两个太阳。你为什么问我？我们的生意很小――为商队提供服务，让它从四个方面出发。这只是生意。}
### {239}{}{Found excuses, right?}
{239}{}{找到了借口，对吧？}
### {240}{}{That's a reasonable thought.}
{240}{}{这是一个合理的想法。}

### {241}{}{What kind of disagreement did you have with the mayor?}
{241}{}{你和市长有什么分歧？}
### {242}{}{Time and children have changed the seasoned tyrant. He went limp and lost the right to tell me. Previously, because of him, I had to be content with the role of manager. It's my time to live beautifully.}
{242}{}{时间和孩子改变了这个老练的暴君。他一瘸一拐地失去了告诉我的权利。以前，因为他，我不得不满足于经理的角色。现在是我活得漂亮的时候了。}
### {243}{}{You will not be denied this. At least - now.}
{243}{}{你不会被拒绝的。至少――现在。}
### {244}{}{Find someone else to chat with. I have neither the time nor the desire for this.}
{244}{}{找其他人聊天。我既没有时间也没有欲望。}
### {245}{}{Well, then I will not interfere.}
{245}{}{那我就不干涉了。}

# After the repair
### {250}{}{Now we can talk a little. What's on your mind?}
{250}{}{现在我们可以聊一聊了。你在想什么？}
### {251}{}{Nothing special. Later.}
{251}{}{没什么特别的。后来}

### {260}{}{Is all this a water station? Impressive.}
{260}{}{这都是供水站吗？给人印象深刻的}
### {261}{}{This station is more than a hundred years old. We only keep the old equipment in working order.}
{261}{}{这个车站已有一百多年的历史了。我们只保持旧设备正常工作。}
### {262}{}{Why do you need so much water?}
{262}{}{你为什么需要这么多水？}
### {263}{}{I have to go. See you later.}
{263}{}{我得走了。回头见。}
### {264}{}{There is another question.}
{264}{}{还有一个问题。}
### {265}{}{And why not? Everyone needs water. There is no life in the desert without it, as they say. For me, it is primarily a source of income. What's there, for the whole city, this is the main feeder.}
{265}{}{为什么不呢？每个人都需要水。正如他们所说，没有它，沙漠中就没有生命。对我来说，这主要是一种收入来源。对整个城市来说，这是主要的支线。}
### {266}{}{Aren't you holding the station in your hands?}
{266}{}{你不是把车站握在手里吗？}
### {267}{}{Water attracts caravans, and they give other types of earnings to residents. Besides, I have to pay to the treasury. The mayor needs caps too.}
{267}{}{水吸引了商队，他们给居民带来了其他类型的收入。此外，我还得向财政部付款。市长也需要上限。}
### {268}{}{And you are, of course, dissatisfied with this?}
{268}{}{当然，你对此不满意吗？}
### {269}{}{Someone has to do the paperwork and negotiate. I'm better at hitting iron on iron. The only thing I would like from Alfred is for him to be tougher with clients. I'm tired of living from water to water.}
{269}{}{必须有人做文书工作和谈判。我更擅长打铁。我唯一希望阿尔弗雷德对客户更加强硬。我厌倦了从水到水的生活。}
### {270}{}{That's how it is. Let's go back a bit.}
{270}{}{事情就是这样。让我们回到过去。}
### {271}{}{Where did you get so much knowledge in pre-war technology?}
{271}{}{你从哪里得到这么多战前技术的知识？}
### {272}{}{To tell the truth, the tinsmiths were engaged in the repair. I can still do something thanks to experience, but the rest of the guys only know which buttons to press.}
{272}{}{说实话，铁匠们正在进行修理。由于经验，我仍然可以做一些事情，但其他人只知道该按哪个按钮。}
### {273}{}{It's like you don't trust them?}
{273}{}{就好像你不信任他们？}
{274}{}{}
### {275}{}{ Tinkerers? Why are you so honored?}
{275}{}{Tinkers？你为什么这么荣幸？}
### {276}{}{I had to give a lot for the reconstruction. But no one else would have done it. Besides, the tinsmiths themselves are interested in developing the trade route.}
{276}{}{我不得不为重建付出很多。但没有其他人会这么做。此外，锡匠自己也有兴趣发展这条贸易路线。}
### {277}{}{Do you know that these technocrats have fallen from their own technologies?}
{277}{}{你知道这些技术官僚已经从他们自己的技术中堕落了吗？}
### {278}{}{I heard. I don't care about the tinkerers. But what should we do when the station again requires serious repairs? I'm afraid to even imagine.}
{278}{}{我听说了。我不在乎修修补补的人。但是，当车站再次需要大修时，我们该怎么办？我甚至不敢想象。}
### {279}{}{Let's go back a bit.}
{279}{}{让我们回到过去。}
### {280}{}{Who is in charge in the city?}
{280}{}{这个城市的负责人是谁？}
### {281}{}{I'm in charge here.}
{281}{}{我在这里负责。}
### {282}{}{That's a twist. So it's you I need to talk to.}
{282}{}{这是一个转折点。所以我需要和你谈谈。}
### {283}{}{The mayor and I are a couple. The mayor's name is Bustos, he lives in a mansion down the road.}
{283}{}{市长和我是一对。市长的名字叫巴斯托斯，他住在路边的一座豪宅里。}
### {284}{}{Tell me about the mayor. What kind of person is he?}
{284}{}{告诉我市长的情况。他是什么样的人？}
### {285}{}{We've known each other for a long time and get along well. Although there are disagreements, for example, on the basis of his daughter. He lets her do too much.}
{285}{}{我们认识很长时间了，相处得很好。尽管有分歧，例如，在他的女儿的基础上。他让她做得太多了。}
### {286}{}{Does he have a daughter?}
{286}{}{他有女儿吗？}
### {287}{}{Nice, but windy girl. I never understood why Bustos forgives her everything. I would have taken up the belt a long time ago in his place.}
{287}{}{漂亮，但有风的女孩。我一直不明白为什么巴斯托斯会原谅她的一切。我早就该接替他的位置了。}
### {288}{}{I see. But let's go back a bit.}
{288}{}{我明白了。但让我们回到过去。}
### {289}{}{How do you feel about the mayor?}
{289}{}{你觉得市长怎么样？}
### {290}{}{Holy simplicity. And you expect me to discuss my best friend with you? What's your business anyway?}
{290}{}{神圣的简单。你希望我和你讨论我最好的朋友吗？你有什么事？}
### {291}{}{And really. I'm just passing through here.}
{291}{}{真的。我只是路过这里。}
### {292}{}{Is there a job in the city?}
{292}{}{这个城市有工作吗？}
### {293}{}{Try asking the mayor. There is no more work for you at my station.}
{293}{}{试着问问市长。我的车站没有更多的工作给你了。}
### {294}{}{I don't think so. There is no more work for you at this station.}
{294}{}{我不这么认为。这个车站没有更多的工作给你了。}
### {295}{}{Okay. Let's change the subject.}
{295}{}{可以让我们换个话题。}
### {296}{}{In that case, I'm stuck in this city for nothing. Goodbye.}
{296}{}{在这种情况下，我被困在这个城市是没有任何意义的。再见}
### {297}{}{I can't offer anything other than fixing this damn filter. Do you understand technology?}
{297}{}{除了修理这个该死的过滤器，我什么都帮不了。你了解技术吗？}
### {298}{}{No, this is not my profile. Let's change the subject.}
{298}{}{不，这不是我的个人资料。让我们换个话题。}
### {299}{}{Let me see, maybe I'll find a solution.}
{299}{}{让我看看，也许我会找到解决方案。}

### {300}{}{I know about what happened at the merchant's. Never mind, poverty makes people crazy.}
{300}{}{我知道在商人那里发生的事情。没关系，贫穷会让人发疯。}
### {301}{}{Are you threatening me?}
{301}{}{你在威胁我吗？}
### {302}{}{If your mind is in order, you won't do anything stupid. Don't spread this story. We need to maintain a reputation.}
{302}{}{如果你头脑正常，你就不会做傻事。不要散布这个故事。我们需要保持声誉。}
### {303}{}{No problems. I didn't see or hear anything.}
{303}{}{没有问题。我什么也没看到，也没听到。}
### {1303}{}{No problems. I didn't see or hear anything.}
{1303}{}{没有问题。我什么也没看到，也没听到。}
### {304}{}{Right answer. Maybe you and I will get along.}
{304}{}{正确答案。也许你和我会相处得很好。}
### {305}{}{Yes... of course.}
{305}{}{对当然}
### {306}{}{You have to pay for silence.}
{306}{}{你必须为沉默付出代价。}
### {307}{}{Don't open your mouth, and you won't have any problems. It's simple.}
{307}{}{不要开口，你就不会有任何问题。这很简单。}
### {308}{}{Ah, that's how it is...}
{308}{}{啊，事情就是这样。。。}
### {309}{}{You have to pay for silence. You don't expect this story to bury itself, do you?}
{309}{}{你必须为沉默付出代价。你不会指望这个故事会自暴自弃吧？}
### {310}{}{Business approach. (counts down 10 caps) But watch your tongue. Otherwise, you'll be in big trouble in this city.}
{310}{}{业务方法。（倒计时10次）但要注意你的舌头。否则，你在这个城市会有大麻烦的。}
### {311}{}{Oh, I understand you perfectly...}
{311}{}{哦，我完全理解你。。。}
