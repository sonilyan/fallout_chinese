### {105}{}{I was thinking about leaving this place... When my father died almost ten years ago, I had no money so I started working here. First as a miner, later, went here and there to earn a living. Life taught me that nothing is for granted and I realized it shortly after my old man was killed...}
{105}{}{我想离开这个地方。。。大约十年前我父亲去世时，我没有钱，所以我开始在这里工作。最初是一名矿工，后来四处谋生。生活告诉我，没有什么是理所当然的，在我的老人被杀后不久，我意识到了这一点。。。}

{108}{}{嗯，我尽量不去想，但另一方面，从那以后，我一直想复仇。如果那些混蛋还在，我会找到他们，让他们付出代价。我一离开这个地方，就在穿过荒原的路上。}

{115}{}{我能找到我的路。。。我从小就在荒原上。我父亲教我如何使用手枪和步枪，所以我对自己的技能毫无疑问。你可以相信我。}
