### {104}{}{Nothing.}
{104}{}{没有什么}
### {105}{}{Not much, since I moved here recently. My skills were requested because the local doctor, Jay, left town some time ago, only to turn out missing. From chatting with the locals, I figured this town has become a very dangerous place. I receive new patients almost too often, mostly victims of robbers or bandits. The good part is I have plenty of medical supplies so I can cure people in a rather short time but there are still too many of those who require medical attention. Of course, the most I can do here is treating light wounds, cuts, burns... But bone fractures for example, I have no other option but to send them to a hospital in Forth City. There they got all kinds of medical equipment.}
{105}{}{不多，因为我最近搬来了。我的技能是被要求的，因为当地的医生周不久前离开了小镇，结果却不见了。从和当地人的聊天中，我发现这个小镇已经变成了一个非常危险的地方。我经常接待新病人，大多是强盗或土匪的受害者。好的方面是我有足够的医疗用品，所以我可以在很短的时间内治愈病人，但仍有太多的人需要医疗护理。当然，我在这里能做的最多的就是治疗轻微的伤口、割伤、烧伤。。。但例如骨折，我别无选择，只能把他们送到福斯市的医院。在那里他们得到了各种各样的医疗设备。}

### {108}{}{It's a small military place. Can't tell you exactly where it is, for my own safety reasons. Anyway, important thing is they want to help people, which is good, but it's not for free. Every month I have to pay them $6000. I'm not supposed to tell you this, but I'm in debt big time. People help me as much as they can, but when it all sums up, still not enough to pay those bills.}
{108}{}{这是一个小型军事场所。出于我自己的安全考虑，我不能告诉你它到底在哪里。不管怎样，重要的是他们想帮助别人，这很好，但这不是免费的。每个月我都要付给他们6000美元。我不应该告诉你这些，但我欠了一大笔债。人们尽可能地帮助我，但当一切结束时，仍然不足以支付这些账单。}

{131}{}{你至少能告诉我附近还有什么城镇吗？我相信我最好的朋友之一就在那里。我想在她出来的时候热烈欢迎她，如果你知道我的意思的话？}
