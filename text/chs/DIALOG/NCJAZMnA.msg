#{100}{}{You see Ornette.}
{100}{}{你看到奥内特了。}
#{101}{}{You see Ornette, a dark-skinned resident of the ghetto.}
{101}{}{你看奥内特，一个黑人区的黑皮肤居民。}
#{103}{}{Nothing to talk about, to be honest.}
{103}{}{说实话，没什么好谈的。}
#{104}{}{See you around, friend.}
{104}{}{再见，朋友。}
#{110}{}{[You see an aged black man with spots and blemishes on his hands. As you walk up, he looks up and carefully looks you over.] Looking for something?}
{110}{}{[你看到一个老黑人手上有斑点和污点。当你走上前去时，他抬起头仔细地看着你？}
#{111}{}{I'm looking for Ornette, the trumpet player. Is that you?}
{111}{}{我在找小号手奥内特。是你吗？}
#{112}{}{Alas, Ornette is no longer a trumpet player. This city didn't need my trumpet or my music. Everyone's too busy trying to survive and get rich. Why are you asking, anyway?}
{112}{}{唉，奥内特不再是小号手了。这个城市不需要我的喇叭和音乐。每个人都忙于生存和致富。你为什么这么问？}
#{113}{}{Well, me and the owner of the "Cotton Club" want to organize a few performances. A trumpet would do perfectly... }
{113}{}{嗯，我和“棉花俱乐部”的老板想组织几场演出。一个喇叭就很好了。。。}
#{114}{}{[Perks up] Old stuff. I've also wanted to resurrect my band, after it fell apart. But what could I do? I sold my trumpet to Wright for three bucks. No way to get it back, since Wright will probably charge out the ass for it. And I'm no trumpeter without a trumpet.}
{114}{}{老东西。我还想让我的乐队在解体后复活。但我能做什么呢？我以三美元的价格把小号卖给了赖特。没办法把它拿回来，因为赖特可能会为此付出代价。我不是没有喇叭的小号手。}
#{115}{}{And if I get it back?}
{115}{}{如果我把它拿回来呢？}
#{116}{}{Then goodbye, trumpetless trumpeteer.}
{116}{}{再见，没有号角的号手。}
#{117}{}{[He thinks silently for a long while before answering] I'm too old for big performances, but I think I can handle a few gigs.}
{117}{}{[他沉默了很久才回答]我年纪太大了，不适合大型演出，但我想我能应付几场演出。}
#{118}{}{I'll take care of it then.}
{118}{}{那我来处理。}
#{119}{}{We'll see what I can do.}
{119}{}{我们看看我能做什么。}
#{120}{}{How's it coming along?}
{120}{}{进展如何？}
#{121}{}{I forgot, what happened to your instrument?}
{121}{}{我忘了，你的乐器怎么了？}
#{122}{}{Ornette, I need to know. Are there any other people who would help us?}
{122}{}{奥内特，我要知道。还有其他人会帮助我们吗？}
#{123}{}{I'd like to know more about your old jazz band.}
{123}{}{我想多了解一下你们以前的爵士乐队。}
#{124}{}{I have your trumpet. Ready to come now?}
{124}{}{我有你的喇叭。准备好了吗？}
#{125}{}{Ehh, not so much. Got a whole lot more things to take care of. Speaking of... }
{125}{}{呃，没那么多。还有很多事情要处理。说到。。。}
#{126}{}{As soon as I have updates, I'll be back.}
{126}{}{我一有最新消息就回来。}
#{127}{}{I sold it to Wright. I suspect he still has it.}
{127}{}{我把它卖给了赖特。我怀疑他还有。}
#{128}{}{There's only two left from the old group. Charles, a guitarist, lives in the slums to the west. He's picked up a real foul temper, last I heard - finding common ground with him will be difficult. And Martin... What a voice! He was the second man in our band after Lou, but he's a huge racist and we've long cut ties. I've also heard of a homeless black man entertaining people on the streets. I've never met him, but he could be useful.}
{128}{}{旧组只剩下两个了。吉他手查尔斯住在西部的贫民窟里。据我所知，他脾气很坏，很难和他找到共同点。还有马丁。。。多好听的声音啊！他是我们乐队中仅次于卢的第二个人，但他是一个巨大的种族主义者，我们早就断绝了联系。我还听说一个无家可归的黑人在街上招待人们。我从没见过他，但他可能有用。}
#{129}{}{It was a long time ago. Big, tight-knit collective, instruments, stage. Big Louie himself led us. But he cut ties with us just before the civil war and sold his honor to raider ideals. Without him, we fell apart. Better off that way... He thought too much of himself.}
{129}{}{那是很久以前的事了。大而紧密的集体，乐器，舞台。大路易亲自带领我们。但他在内战前与我们断绝了联系，并把他的荣誉卖给了理想突击队。没有他，我们分崩离析。最好是那样。。。他太看重自己了。}
#{130}{}{[Carefully examines the instrument, wrinkled fingers tracing the smooth metal] I haven't held her for years now... I need some time to practice and remember everything. Thank you.}
{130}{}{[仔细检查仪器，布满皱纹的手指抚摸着光滑的金属]我已经好多年没有抱她了。。。我需要一些时间来练习和记住一切。非常感谢。}
#{131}{}{Alright, see you around.}
{131}{}{好的，回头见。}
#{140}{}{Thank you for doing this. Very honorable... For a white man.}
{140}{}{谢谢你这么做。非常荣幸。。。对于一个白人来说。}
#{141}{}{Know anyone who'll be of any use to us?}
{141}{}{你认识对我们有用的人吗？}
#{142}{}{I want to hear about that old jazz-band.}
{142}{}{我想听听那个老爵士乐队的情况。}
#{143}{}{No problem.}
{143}{}{没问题。}
#{144}{}{Looks like we've got everyone. Who didn't you find?}
{144}{}{看来我们每个人都来了。你没找到谁？}
#{145}{}{I've got one guy in mind. Charles, a guitarist, lives in the slums to the west. He's picked up a real foul temper, last I heard - finding common ground with him will be difficult.}
{145}{}{我心里只有一个人。吉他手查尔斯住在西部的贫民窟里。据我所知，他脾气很坏，很难和他找到共同点。}
#{146}{}{I've got one guy in mind. I've heard of a homeless black man entertaining people on the streets. I've never met him, but he could be useful.}
{146}{}{我心里只有一个人。我听说一个无家可归的黑人在街上招待人们。我从没见过他，但他可能有用。}
#{147}{}{Milton said you witnessed the attack. Tell me what you know.}
{147}{}{米尔顿说你目睹了袭击。告诉我你知道什么。}
#{148}{}{Oh... Listen, can we talk alone? Don't want anyone else to hear. You see, I think I know who paid for the hit. It's more than likely to be Martin. It was his handwriting on that note.}
{148}{}{哦。。。听着，我们能单独谈谈吗？不想让别人听到。你看，我想我知道是谁付钱的。很可能是马丁。那张纸条上是他的笔迹。}
#{149}{}{Who's that?}
{149}{}{那是谁？}
#{150}{}{We played in Big Louie's band. He left after the collective fell apart. That's why he has a bone to pick with us. And he isn't too fond of whites playing in a jazz-band.}
{150}{}{我们在大路易的乐队演奏。集体解体后他离开了。所以他才跟我们挑刺。他也不太喜欢白人在爵士乐队演奏。}
#{151}{}{And that's enough for him to try and shut down these concerts?}
{151}{}{这就足够让他关闭这些音乐会了？}
#{152}{}{Oh, don't underestimate the stubbornness of an old, black man. His ambitions won't stop him from turning this place upside down.}
{152}{}{哦，别小看一个老黑人的固执。他的野心不会阻止他把这个地方搞得一团糟。}
#{153}{}{So, what do we do?}
{153}{}{那么，我们该怎么办？}
#{154}{}{Well, first of all, don't tell Milton. If he finds out, then he'll try and get rid of the old guy. Then try and talk things out with Martin yourself. I know it won't be easy. But if the old man has any problems 'cuz of you, don't expect me to talk to you.}
{154}{}{首先，别告诉米尔顿。如果他发现了，他会设法除掉那个老家伙。然后试着和马丁谈谈。我知道这不容易。但是如果老人因为你有什么问题，别指望我会和你说话。}
#{155}{}{Got it. Where does he live?}
{155}{}{知道了。他住在哪里？}
#{156}{}{On the railroad, in one of the houses opposite Frank Cochran's. Good luck.}
{156}{}{在铁路上，在弗兰克・科克伦对面的一所房子里。祝你好运。}
#{157}{}{Well, I'm off.}
{157}{}{好吧，我走了。}
#{160}{}{[Approaching the stage, you notice all the band members gathering around you to shake your hand.]}
{160}{}{[走近舞台，你注意到所有的乐队成员都聚集在你身边和你握手。]}
#{161}{}{I guess that means we won't be performing together again?}
{161}{}{我想那意味着我们不会再一起表演了？}
#{162}{}{Yes. We got word that Martin is dead. We don't know who did it, but we do know that he was jealous of this band and you specifically. And you knew too. Sorry, but the story is too suspicious... Martin, as envious as he was, was still one of us. We did well together, before you appeared. That's why we think it would be best to break up. Thanks for everything.}
{162}{}{对。我们听说马丁死了。我们不知道是谁干的，但我们知道他嫉妒这个乐队，特别是你。你也知道。对不起，这个故事太可疑了。。。马丁虽然很羡慕，但他还是我们中的一员。在你出现之前，我们相处得很好。所以我们认为最好分手。谢谢你所做的一切。}
#{163}{}{Yeah, I did get him out of the way. Just like he tried with me. What's the difference?}
{163}{}{是的，我把他弄走了。就像他对我做的那样。有什么区别？}
#{164}{}{Well, take care, fellas! Good luck with your new band.}
{164}{}{好吧，保重，伙计们！祝你的新乐队好运。}
#{165}{}{[Ornette shakes his head as everyone looks down] Looks like whites never change. You wouldn't understand, don't worry about it.}
{165}{}{[奥内特摇摇头，每个人都往下看]看起来白人永远不会变。你不会明白的，别担心。}
#{166}{}{Well, goodbye. Not like I needed your shitty band. I'll take care of things on my own!}
{166}{}{好吧，再见。我不需要你那该死的乐队。我会自己处理的！}
#{167}{}{Yes. That's what you agreed with Martin. Besides, sorry to be blunt, but he's much better at vocals than you. He was born for it. In part, he's right - jazz is for blacks. No discrimination, just how events turn out. Better we all go our ways. Thank you for everything. Especially for gathering us back together. We won't forget it.}
{167}{}{对。你同意马丁的意见。另外，很抱歉直说，但他的声乐比你好得多。他生来就是为了这个。在某种程度上，他是对的――爵士乐是黑人的。没有歧视，只是事情的结果。最好我们各就各位。谢谢你所做的一切。特别是为了让我们重聚在一起。我们不会忘记的。}
