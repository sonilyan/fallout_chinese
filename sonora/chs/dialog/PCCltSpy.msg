{260}{}{好的我们能做些什么来消除它？}
### {261}{}{Eliminating Aaron is not the main thing. After all, the church is now much bigger than it seems. We are connected with other forces in Arizona, our banner directs entire settlements on a new path. You can't just eliminate one person to stop the whole process.}
{261}{}{淘汰亚伦并不是主要的事情。毕竟，教堂现在比看上去要大得多。我们与亚利桑那州的其他部队有联系，我们的旗帜指引整个定居点走上一条新的道路。你不能仅仅淘汰一个人来阻止整个过程。}

{262}{}{你有什么建议，普赖尔・马蒂亚斯？}

### {275}{}{Aaron and his Advisor are well protected, but you will have enough strength if you act quickly and decisively. It is necessary to catch them by surprise in different parts of the cathedral so that they cannot unite. I will make sure that peaceful monks do not interfere with your battle.}
{275}{}{亚伦和他的顾问得到了很好的保护，但如果你迅速果断地行动，你就会有足够的力量。有必要在大教堂的不同地方出其不意地抓住他们，这样他们就无法团结起来。我会确保和平的僧侣不会干扰你的战斗。}

{310}{}{在前面从图书馆的笔记中可以清楚地看出，你遵循了新手的惯例。}
### {311}{}{Of course. As one of the caretakers of the temple, I have access to this information. And if you don't want to be burned at a heretical bonfire, then I advise you to find something more weighty in my address. Now disappear.}
{311}{}{当然作为寺庙的管理员之一，我可以获得这些信息。如果你不想在异端的篝火旁被烧死，那么我建议你在我的地址里找一些更有分量的东西。现在消失。}

### {323}{}{So you admit that you leaked information to the enemies of the church?}
{323}{}{所以你承认你向教会的敌人泄露了信息？}

{330}{}{我不得不说，我没想到一个来自荒原的新人能够解开这个案子。我甚至对亚伦隐瞒了自己的行为。但是你...}
### {331}{}{But why do you, a servant of Aaron, help his enemies?}
{331}{}{但你作为亚伦的仆人，为什么帮助他的敌人呢？}
### {332}{}{Under Aaron's leadership, the church changed its beliefs. The stronghold of holiness and wisdom has become a receptacle of sin. I can't look at it anymore.}
{332}{}{在亚伦的领导下，教会改变了信仰。神圣和智慧的堡垒已经成为罪恶的容器。我再也看不下去了。}
### {333}{}{Tell this story.}

### {334}{}{A dozen years ago we were a peaceful church away from people. We kept pre-war relics and knowledge to pass them on to those who would be worthy to receive them.}

### {335}{}{Apparently, such a person was found?}
{335}{}{很显然，发现了这样一个人？}
### {336}{}{People came from the south. They lured our priors to their side and with the help of the church staged a revolution in the city. Aaron became the Lord of the Phoenix, although before that he was only a mid-level cleric.}
{336}{}{人们来自南方。他们引诱我们的修道院院长站在他们一边，并在教堂的帮助下在城市里发动了一场革命。亚伦成为了凤凰之主，尽管在此之前他只是一名中级神职人员。}
### {337}{}{And that doesn't suit you?}
{337}{}{这不适合你吗？}
### {338}{}{Our mission was to protect ancient knowledge. We should have been more attentive to those whom we let near them. We made a terrible mistake, for which we will all end up in a Nuclear Hell.}
{338}{}{我们的使命是保护古代知识。我们本应该更加关心那些我们让他们靠近的人。我们犯了一个可怕的错误，为此我们都将陷入核地狱。}

{339}{}{谁是攻击新手的人？}
### {340}{}{Who are the people you help?}
{340}{}{你帮助的人是谁？}
### {341}{}{It's a long story. Ever since the revolution in Phoenix, there has been a detachment of rebels who call themselves the "Liberation Party". So far, they have tried to keep a low profile in order to accumulate strength and unexpectedly overthrow Aaron. Although I do not agree with them in everything, but we had an agreement about the departure of the church from the city.}
{341}{}{说来话长。自从凤凰城发生革命以来，就有一支自称“解放党”的叛军队伍。到目前为止，他们一直试图保持低调，以积累力量，并出乎意料地推翻亚伦。虽然我并不完全同意他们的观点，但我们就教堂离开城市达成了协议。}

### {344}{}{I don't care what drives you. Just tell me, why would I leave the case open?}
{344}{}{我不在乎是什么驱使你。告诉我，我为什么要把案子开着？}
### {345}{}{Sooner or later, Aaron will figure out the source of the information leak. But it is not my bodily shell that worries me, but the mission of the church.}
{345}{}{迟早，Aaron会找出信息泄露的源头。但让我担心的不是我的身体外壳，而是教会的使命。}
### {346}{}{Do you want to win me over to your side?}
{346}{}{你想把我争取到你身边吗？}
### {347}{}{To begin with, I propose to meet with the rebels and discuss everything face to face.}
{347}{}{首先，我提议与叛军会面，面对面讨论一切。}
### {348}{}{It's stupid. I'll tell Aaron everything.}

{352}{}{就这样吧。在联合车站下面找党的总参谋部。你只能通过收集者才能到达那里。告诉他们你是我的，在此期间我会尽力警告他们。祝你好运}

### {359}{}{But you don't deny it, do you? }

### {361}{}{I have no more questions.}

### {362}{}{I can trust you, can't I? Murphy is one of us. He infiltrated the ranks of the gang to direct these poor unreasonable people to the righteous side.}
{362}{}{我可以信任你，不是吗？墨菲就是我们中的一员。他渗透到帮派的队伍中，将这些可怜的、不讲理的人引导到正义的一边。}
