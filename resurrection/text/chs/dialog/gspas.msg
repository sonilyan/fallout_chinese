#{100}{}{You see a man.}
{100}{}{你看到一个男人。}
#{150}{}{You see the Savior.}
{150}{}{你看到救世主了。}
#{200}{}{You see a man in power armor without a helmet, you recognize his face. The sheer determination reflected in his eyes gives you the creeps.}
{200}{}{你看到一个身穿盔甲，没有头盔的人，你认出了他的脸。他眼神中流露出的坚定让你毛骨悚然。}
#{250}{}{You see the Savior, the founder and leader of the Rebirth. He is determined to reach the final goal of the Rebirth at all costs.}
{250}{}{你看到了救世主，重生的创始人和领袖。他决心不惜一切代价达到重生的最终目标。}
#{251}{}{You see the Savior, the founder and leader of the Rebirth. He is determined to fulfill his mission at all costs.}
{251}{}{你看到了救世主，重生的创始人和领袖。他决心不惜一切代价完成他的使命。}
#{252}{}{You see the Savior, the founder and leader of the Rebirth. He is awaiting his death by the auto destruction of the complex with a blank stare.}
{252}{}{你看到了救世主，重生的创始人和领袖。他目瞪口呆地等待着自己的死亡。}
#{300}{}{If I die, nothing changes. The Rebirth will be all the more ruthless. My mission shall be accomplished!}
{300}{}{如果我死了，一切都不会改变。重生将更加无情。我的任务就要完成了！}
#{301}{}{The Savior ignores you.}
{301}{}{救世主不理你。}
#{350}{}{The Savior initiates a silent auto destruction sequence.}
{350}{}{救世主启动了一个无声的自动毁灭序列。}
#{351}{}{There is still a normal around here you must kill. Prove you are sufficiently devoted to the Rebirth's cause.}
{351}{}{这里还有一个正常人你必须杀了。证明你对重生的事业有足够的投入。}
#{352}{}{There is still a normal around here you must kill. Prove you are sufficiently devoted to the Rebirth's cause.}
{352}{}{这里还有一个正常人你必须杀了。证明你对重生的事业有足够的投入。}
#{400}{}{I will put an end to your treason once and for all.}
{400}{}{我将一劳永逸地结束你的叛国行为。}
#{401}{}{You will die a traitor.}
{401}{}{你会成为叛徒的。}
#{402}{}{Your time has now run up.}
{402}{}{你的时间到了。}
#{403}{}{Do you really believe you are able to kill me?!}
{403}{}{你真的相信你能杀了我吗？！}
#{404}{}{You will never be able to stop the Rebirth!}
{404}{}{你永远无法阻止重生！}
#{405}{}{There's nothing here for you to fight for.}
{405}{}{这里没有什么值得你为之奋斗的。}
#{406}{}{Your death will only move the Rebirth onward!}
{406}{}{你的死只会让重生继续！}
#{407}{}{Everybody will die, eventually.}
{407}{}{最终每个人都会死。}
#{408}{}{You will die a traitor.}
{408}{}{你会成为叛徒的。}
#{409}{}{I will put an end to your treason once and for all.}
{409}{}{我将一劳永逸地结束你的叛国行为。}
#{410}{}{My mission shall be fulfilled!}
{410}{}{我的任务就要完成了！}
#{411}{}{Your efforts are futile, there is no hope.}
{411}{}{你的努力是徒劳的，没有希望。}
#{412}{}{This won't stop me, I am prepared to die.}
{412}{}{这不能阻止我，我已经准备好死了。}
#{500}{}{Oh, look who we have here. The runaway son returns home. Huh? Did you think I wouldn't recognize you, Thirteenth? [That face, the voice, even the gestures, all of them must have been lodged deep in your memory, because you recognized them at once.]}
{500}{}{哦，看看谁来了。离家出走的儿子回家了。呵呵？你以为我认不出你吗，十三号？[那张脸，那声音，甚至那些手势，一定都深深地留在了你的记忆里，因为你一眼就认出了它们。]}
#{501}{}{The Savior.}
{501}{}{救世主。}
#{502}{}{Savee!}
{502}{}{萨维！}
#{550}{}{Have you finally come to understand it's futile to run? Or have you come here driven by an impulse of an impracticable illusion you will crown your treason with the destruction of the Rebirth?}
{550}{}{你终于明白逃跑是徒劳的了吗？或者你是被一种不切实际的幻觉所驱使而来到这里的，你将以重生的毁灭来为你的叛国加冕？}
#{551}{}{I will kill you. That sounds pretty "practicable" to me!}
{551}{}{我要杀了你。对我来说，这听起来很“可行”！}
#{552}{}{I am not a traitor. You just made me out to be one!}
{552}{}{我不是叛徒。你让我变成了一个！}
#{553}{}{The Rebirth is an illusion. How can it possibly reach its goal?}
{553}{}{重生是一种幻觉。它怎么可能达到它的目标呢？}
#{554}{}{And what sense would there be in giving up?}
{554}{}{放弃又有什么意义呢？}
#{600}{}{So you do seek to continue in your despicable treason against the Rebirth. But if a single brain cell of mine believed there was even the smallest possibility of you killing me, you wouldn't be standing here now! Think about it before you do anything. Try it for once.}
{600}{}{所以你要继续你卑鄙的叛国，反对重生。但是如果我的一个脑细胞相信你杀我的可能性极小，你现在就不会站在这里了！想一想再做任何事。试一下。}
#{601}{}{You can't scare me, it's time for you to die!}
{601}{}{你吓不倒我，你该死了！}
#{602}{}{What treason are you talking about?! It was you who put me in a machine that sentenced me to death!}
{602}{}{你在说什么叛国？！是你把我放进机器里判了我死刑！}
#{603}{}{You're the real traitor!}
{603}{}{你才是真正的叛徒！}
#{650}{}{Was it me that forced you to get into that machine? I merely offered you the honor of serving the Rebirth in the greatest means possible and you voluntarily accepted. And had you known this highest honor meant also being a sacrifice, you would've been even more eager to accept. So what is it you are accusing me of?}
{650}{}{是我逼你上那台机器的吗？我只是给你以最大可能的方式为重生服务的荣誉，你自愿接受了。如果你知道这个最高荣誉也意味着牺牲，你会更加渴望接受。你在指责我什么？}
#{651}{}{But I didn't know!}
{651}{}{但我不知道！}
#{700}{}{That is inconsequential. After all, what was your reaction after you'd found out? You ran away, betrayed us all.}
{700}{}{那是无关紧要的。毕竟，你发现后有什么反应？你跑了，背叛了我们所有人。}
#{701}{}{You turned me into a traitor!}
{701}{}{你把我变成了叛徒！}
#{702}{}{You're a traitor, the machine never worked properly!}
{702}{}{你是个叛徒，机器从来没有正常工作过！}
#{703}{}{The Rebirth is just an illusion. How can it reach its goal?}
{703}{}{重生只是一种幻觉。如何才能达到目标？}
#{704}{}{And what do you intend to do with me now?}
{704}{}{你现在打算拿我怎么办？}
#{750}{}{I am a traitor? How did you come to a notion like that? My only offense against the Rebirth is that I chose you to be reborn, someone so unstable. That great privilege was too much for you to bear and now you seek to hurt everybody around you.}
{750}{}{我是叛徒？你怎么会有这样的想法？我唯一反对重生的是我选择了你重生，一个如此不稳定的人。那巨大的特权是你无法承受的，现在你想伤害你周围的每一个人。}
#{751}{}{Thomas found out the machine can never work properly. He told me this before he died.}
{751}{}{托马斯发现这台机器永远不能正常工作。他死前告诉我的。}
#{752}{}{Thomas found out the machine can never work properly. Even though he's dead, I know it from the recording of his interrogation by the Hunters.}
{752}{}{托马斯发现这台机器永远不能正常工作。即使他死了，我还是从猎人审问他的录音里知道的。}
#{800}{}{I say this with a heavy heart, but Thomas was mentally ill. He couldn't cope with the fact he couldn't find the solution to our problem. Combined with your escape, it pressed on him too hard. The results of his work were getting less and less meaningful. We wanted to help him, provide him with medical care, make him get better, but he escaped.}
{800}{}{我心情沉重地说这话，但托马斯有精神病。他无法应付找不到解决我们问题的办法的事实。再加上你的逃跑，他受的压力太大了。他的工作成果越来越没有意义了。我们想帮助他，给他提供医疗服务，让他康复，但他逃跑了。}
#{801}{}{But you made a traitor out of him.}
{801}{}{但你把他变成了叛徒。}
#{802}{}{He found out from partially recovered data about the machine. Data you had erased.}
{802}{}{他从部分恢复的机器数据中发现了这一点。你删除的数据。}
#{803}{}{The Twelfth spoke about the original data of the machine which confirm Thomas' claims.}
{803}{}{第十二位谈到了机器的原始数据，这些数据证实了托马斯的说法。}
#{804}{}{Scientifically, it's obvious a permanent cure for the mutations is simply impossible.}
{804}{}{从科学上讲，很明显，永久治愈突变是不可能的。}
#{805}{}{I think you have always been a normal, you never underwent the process.}
{805}{}{我觉得你一直都是个正常人，你从来没有经历过这个过程。}
#{806}{}{Why are you trying to persuade me?}
{806}{}{你为什么要说服我？}
#{850}{}{It was necessary, just like in your case. He had to be stopped at all costs. He knew too much about the Rebirth and by making his treatment impossible, there was no way to help him. It would've been unfortunate if those ordered to stop him felt compassion for him, so I claimed his poor results were sabotage. I didn't make that decision lightly, but you are the one who is really responsible for it. He honored your friendship and at the same time dreamed of rebirth. For everybody. The crossing of his two loyalties had been bearing down on him too heavily.}
{850}{}{这是必要的，就像你的情况一样。必须不惜一切代价阻止他。他对重生知道得太多了，使他的治疗无法进行，也没有办法帮助他。如果那些下令阻止他的人同情他，那就太不幸了，所以我声称他糟糕的结果是蓄意破坏。我不是轻易做出那个决定的，但你才是真正对此负责的人。他尊重你的友谊，同时梦想重生。为了每个人。他两个忠诚的交锋对他影响太大了。}
#{851}{}{Thomas found and restored part of the data about the machine. Data you had erased.}
{851}{}{托马斯发现并恢复了有关这台机器的部分数据。你删除的数据。}
#{852}{}{The Twelfth spoke about the original data of the machine which confirm Thomas' claims.}
{852}{}{第十二位谈到了机器的原始数据，这些数据证实了托马斯的说法。}
#{853}{}{Scientifically, it's obvious a permanent cure for the mutations is simply impossible.}
{853}{}{从科学上讲，很明显，永久治愈突变是不可能的。}
#{854}{}{I think you have always been a normal, you never underwent the process.}
{854}{}{我觉得你一直都是个正常人，你从来没有经历过这个过程。}
#{855}{}{Why are you trying to persuade me?}
{855}{}{你为什么要说服我？}
#{900}{}{You have no idea what I had to go through to get here and get reborn. And I did it without any data, because there was none here. And you dare to question this? Don't you understand it's precisely talk like this that undermines our effort to really solve the problem? When instead of honest effort people here hope some lost files will solve everything for them or even prove to them they should not strive for achievement.}
{900}{}{你不知道我要经历什么才能来到这里重生。我是在没有任何数据的情况下做的，因为这里没有数据。你敢质疑吗？难道你不明白，正是这样的言论破坏了我们真正解决问题的努力吗？当这里的人们希望一些丢失的档案能为他们解决所有的问题，甚至向他们证明他们不应该为成就而奋斗时，他们却没有诚实的努力。}
#{901}{}{The Twelfth also talked about those files.}
{901}{}{第十二个也谈到了这些文件。}
#{902}{}{Scientifically, it's obvious a permanent cure for the mutations is simply impossible.}
{902}{}{从科学上讲，很明显，永久治愈突变是不可能的。}
#{903}{}{I think you have always been a normal, you never underwent the process.}
{903}{}{我觉得你一直都是个正常人，你从来没有经历过这个过程。}
#{904}{}{Why are you trying to persuade me?}
{904}{}{你为什么要说服我？}
#{950}{}{Of course, the Twelfth could have talked about anything. His body is in the final stages of disintegration. His cellular structure disintegrates and the first cells to go are the ones in his brain. You yourself had an experience of the impact it may have.}
{950}{}{当然，第十二个可以谈任何事。他的身体正处于解体的最后阶段。他的细胞结构解体，最先消失的细胞是他大脑中的细胞。你自己也经历过它可能带来的影响。}
#{951}{}{More importantly, I gained an experience about the treatment the reborn were given.}
{951}{}{更重要的是，我获得了一个经验，对治疗重生。}
#{952}{}{Scientifically, it's obvious a permanent cure for the mutations is simply impossible.}
{952}{}{从科学上讲，很明显，永久治愈突变是不可能的。}
#{953}{}{I think you have always been a normal, you never underwent the process.}
{953}{}{我觉得你一直都是个正常人，你从来没有经历过这个过程。}
#{954}{}{Why are you trying to persuade me?}
{954}{}{你为什么要说服我？}
#{1000}{}{They became normal, healthy people and they were fine. Of course, they eventually paid for it with a painful death, but that was their sacrifice. Many ghouls of the Rebirth undergo the same without being reborn. If one can't fully comprehend this, one must live in the illusion that the reborn die painlessly under sedation. Such a person will never realize that if this was true, they couldn't get relevant data regarding the disintegration of the body. As far as the Eleventh and Twelfth are concerned, I was forced to move them to Blue 6 ahead of time just because of your treason. People stopped trusting the reborn, sooner or later, everyone would've asked for it.}
{1000}{}{他们变成了正常，健康的人，他们很好。当然，他们最终付出了痛苦的代价，但那是他们的牺牲。许多重生的僵尸经历同样的经历却没有重生。如果你不能完全理解这一点，你必须活在一种幻觉中，即重生者在镇静下无痛地死去。这样的人永远不会意识到，如果这是真的，他们无法获得有关身体解体的相关数据。至于第十一和第十二，因为你的叛国罪，我被迫提前把他们调到蓝6。人们不再相信重生，迟早每个人都会要求的。}
#{1001}{}{Scientifically, it's obvious a permanent cure for the mutations is simply impossible.}

{1002}{}{我觉得你一直都是个正常人，你从来没有经历过这个过程。}
#{1003}{}{Why are you trying to persuade me?}
{1003}{}{你为什么要说服我？}
#{1050}{}{Here I am, a man of flesh and blood, standing right in front of you, indisputable proof of the fact that the whole process of rebirth can work properly. How about you try to find a solution instead of taking the easy way out and claiming such solution does not exist just because you don't see it?}
{1050}{}{我在这里，一个有血有肉的人，站在你面前，无可争辩地证明了整个重生过程都能正常运转。不如你试着找到一个解决办法，而不是采取简单的办法，并声称这样的解决办法不存在，只是因为你看不到它？}
#{1051}{}{One day, maybe your body will disintegrate, too.}
{1051}{}{也许有一天，你的身体也会解体。}
#{1052}{}{You have always been a normal. You were never a ghoul, you never underwent the procedure.}
{1052}{}{你一直是个普通人。你从来不是僵尸，你从来没有接受过手术。}
#{1053}{}{Why are you trying to persuade me?}
{1053}{}{你为什么要说服我？}
#{1100}{}{Really? It was you who just by escaping threatened the existence of the whole Rebirth. You even started visiting cities, you have been seen entering Albuquerque, the headquarters of the Mutant Hunters. Isn't that enough for you?}
{1100}{}{真正地？是你通过逃跑威胁到了整个重生的存在。你甚至开始访问城市，你被看到进入阿尔伯克基，变异猎人的总部。这对你来说还不够吗？}

#{1200}{}{All of the effort of so many ghouls aimed at a single goal, the day of rebirth for all. Is that not enough for you? You should know all too well yourself that the Rebirth cannot be stopped until it reaches its goal. You were a part of it.}

#{1300}{}{And what gives them greater right to live? Nature? Nature had nothing to do with the extermination of billions of people during the thermonuclear war, nor with the transformation of many of those that survived into ghouls. Power? More than trying to kill us, they are busy killing each other. We are already more powerful and united. Is it destiny or a mere coincidence? Do you want us to give up our lives for something like that?}
{1300}{}{是什么赋予他们更大的生存权？自然？自然与热核战争期间数十亿人的灭绝无关，也与许多幸存者变成僵尸无关。权力？他们不只是想杀我们，还忙着互相残杀。我们已经更加强大和团结。是命运还是巧合？你想让我们为了那样的事放弃生命吗？}

#{1350}{}{Have you been a normal human for so long you have already forgotten what it's like to be a ghoul? Such existence cannot be called life, it's merely a protraction of suffering leading to an inevitable extinction. Of course, it would be convenient for normals if ghouls accepted their partial existence. All they would have to do would be to wait for ghouls to die out, but the normals are not even capable of that. They kill ghouls on sight. Their main reason is fear that they will become ghouls themselves. Nobody wants to be a ghoul.}
{1350}{}{你做了这么长时间的正常人，已经忘记了当僵尸是什么感觉了吗？这种存在不能被称为生命，它仅仅是一种长期的痛苦导致不可避免的灭绝。当然，如果僵尸接受他们的部分存在，对正常人来说是很方便的。他们所要做的就是等待僵尸灭绝，但正常人甚至没有能力做到这一点。他们一看到僵尸就杀。他们的主要原因是害怕自己会变成僵尸。没人想成为僵尸。}

#{1501}{}{How?}
{1501}{}{怎么用？}
#{1550}{}{You'll give the Rebirth the whole of Albuquerque. We've never been able to get anyone inside the city. We've always protected the reborn, and no ghoul will get further than to the city walls, but you've been inside. You can give us information about their defenses, and once we're prepared for the attack, you'll be there to carry out devastating sabotages. This time, Albuquerque will finally fall, the Mutant Hunters will be defeated and we'll gain a great number of quality donors. After this victory, there'll be nothing to stop us from accomplishing our ultimate goal.}

#{2550}{}{It's about accomplishing something that has never been finished. It's about the final suffering. About the closing of a dead end of evolution. About the liberation from the claws of a tyrant. You can give it any name you like, but it's about the extermination of the whole of humanity.}
{2550}{}{它是关于完成一些从未完成的事情。是关于最后的痛苦。关于终结进化的死胡同。关于从暴君的魔爪中解放出来。你可以给它起任何名字，但它是关于整个人类的灭绝。}
#{2551}{}{What?!}
{2551}{}{什么？！}
#{2600}{}{In a way, I had perceived the truth even when I was a Mutant Hunter, but I fully realized it after my squad had been destroyed by a group of supermutants. I wandered the wasteland and stumbled upon this place, completely accidentally. And here, while I was recovering from my wounds, I started to realize that the efforts to exterminate all mutants had not been in order to save the so called pure humans. Its purpose was to rid the world of all humans. Sooner or later, most of them will mutate in some way. Humanity is an ulcer that must be removed and it came close to it once. Everybody should have died in the nuclear war and the world should have started again with something better. But it didn't happen. This pathetic species, so effective at wiping itself out, failed when it came to complete extermination. I understood it was my task to finish it.}
{2600}{}{在某种程度上，我甚至在我还是一个变种猎人的时候就已经意识到了真相，但在我的队伍被一群超级变种人摧毁之后，我完全意识到了这一点。我在荒地里漫步，无意中发现了这个地方。在这里，当我从伤口中恢复过来的时候，我开始意识到消灭所有变种人的努力并不是为了拯救所谓的纯人类。它的目的是消灭世界上所有的人类。它们中的大多数迟早会以某种方式变异。人性是一个溃疡，必须清除，它曾经接近它。每个人都应该死于核战争，世界应该从更好的开始。但没有发生。这可怜的物种，如此有效地消灭自己，失败时，它来完成灭绝。我明白完成它是我的任务。}
#{2601}{}{How does the Rebirth come into this?}
{2601}{}{重生是怎么来的？}
#{2650}{}{The fact that I was given a tool to fulfill my mission, forever confirmed its righteous purpose. Ghouls came here, and without them knowing, I blocked all the doors and watched them through the surveillance cameras. As they were getting further into the depths of the complex, I learned their purpose. They were looking for the machine I knew everything about from the records. Their desire of becoming normal humans once again was so strong there was no doubt they would do anything for it.}
{2650}{}{事实上，我得到了一个工具来完成我的使命，永远证实了它的正义目的。僵尸来到这里，在他们不知道的情况下，我堵住了所有的门，通过监控摄像头观察他们。当他们深入到建筑群的深处时，我明白了他们的目的。他们在找我从记录里知道的那台机器。他们再次成为正常人的愿望是如此强烈，毫无疑问他们会为此做任何事。}
#{2651}{}{So what did you do?}
{2651}{}{你做了什么？}
#{2660}{}{I deleted all data about the machine and anything related to it and acted as the Savior they were seeking, without them realizing it. They were so surprised their dream was really possible that they doubted nothing I told them. This was all that was needed to start things running. All I have to do is point the Rebirth in the right direction occasionally. In their search for the error in the process, the ghouls will exterminate every single normal and will be exterminated themselves, eventually. Then the mission will be finished.}
{2660}{}{我删除了所有关于这台机器的数据和任何与之相关的数据，并充当了他们正在寻找的救世主，而他们却没有意识到这一点。他们太惊讶了，他们的梦想真的有可能实现，以至于他们对我告诉他们的一切都毫不怀疑。这就是开始运转所需要的一切。我所要做的只是偶尔把重生指向正确的方向。在他们寻找错误的过程中，僵尸会消灭每一个正常人，并最终消灭自己。那任务就完成了。}
#{2661}{}{So the machine never really worked?}
{2661}{}{所以这台机器从来没有真正工作过？}
#{2662}{}{Why the annual rebirth?}
{2662}{}{为什么一年一度的重生？}
#{2663}{}{How can the Rebirth exterminate all humans in the world?}
{2663}{}{重生如何能消灭世界上所有的人类？}
#{2664}{}{I still don't understand why you're seeking the extermination of mankind.}
{2664}{}{我还是不明白你为什么要消灭人类。}
#{2665}{}{I will tell you something about that.}
{2665}{}{我要告诉你一些事情。}
#{2700}{}{You still have hope it once worked? The Vault-Tec scientists worked on the project concerning mutation and irradiation treatment for many years, and that machine is the result of their efforts. They reached the conclusion that permanent treatment isn't possible and terminated the project. I erased all records containing any information of this nature before the ghouls reached the fifth floor.}
{2700}{}{你还希望它曾经奏效吗？Vault-Tec的科学家们多年来一直致力于有关突变和辐射治疗的项目，而这台机器正是他们努力的结果。他们得出结论说永久治疗是不可能的，于是终止了这个项目。在僵尸到达五楼之前，我删除了所有包含这种性质信息的记录。}
#{2701}{}{Why the annual rebirth?}
{2701}{}{为什么一年一度的重生？}
#{2702}{}{How can the Rebirth exterminate all humans in the world?}
{2702}{}{重生如何能消灭世界上所有的人类？}
#{2703}{}{I still don't understand why you're seeking the extermination of mankind.}
{2703}{}{我还是不明白你为什么要消灭人类。}
#{2704}{}{I will tell you something about that.}
{2704}{}{我要告诉你一些事情。}
#{2750}{}{It had its proclaimed effects, there's no point denying that. But the truth is it's a perfect means of getting rid of unwanted individuals who are in the wrong places. They are willing and more than happy to get away from their jobs and get rid of their lives. Isn't that beautiful? For instance, the Twelfth discovered the remnants of the original data about the machine, but before he managed to find out what it was about, he had been reborn. You were friends with Thomas and thus you could potentially find out from him the fact that the machine isn't functional. I could not allow that, all soldiers must believe the rebirth is very close and they are fighting for a righteous cause, to make it available to all. They mustn't know that the donors they're obtaining by risking their own lives are in fact killed in experiments without any purpose.}
{2750}{}{它有它宣称的效果，没有必要否认这一点。但事实是，这是一个完美的方法，摆脱不受欢迎的人谁是在错误的地方。他们愿意并且非常乐意离开工作，摆脱生活。那不是很美吗？例如，第十二个发现了关于这台机器的原始数据的残余，但在他设法找出它是关于什么之前，他已经重生了。你和托马斯是朋友，因此你有可能从他那里发现这台机器不起作用的事实。我不能允许，所有的士兵必须相信重生是非常接近的，他们是为了正义的事业而战斗，使它对所有人。他们不应该知道，他们冒着生命危险获得的捐赠者实际上是在毫无目的的实验中被杀死的。}
#{2751}{}{So the machine never really worked?}
{2751}{}{所以这台机器从来没有真正工作过？}
#{2752}{}{How can the Rebirth exterminate all humans in the world?}

{2753}{}{我还是不明白你为什么要消灭人类。}
#{2754}{}{I will tell you something about that.}
{2754}{}{我要告诉你一些事情。}
#{2800}{}{Why? But isn't that obvious? Nuclear war was mankind's doom. What's happening today is merely its death throe, protracted without an end in sight. But it can end in death, an absolute end. People themselves partly realize this. That's why they are trying to exterminate each other and finish this process. As a Mutant Hunter, I myself had unwittingly contributed to this goal, because those who do not kill each other, eventually mutate and die infertile. This conclusion is inevitable, I will merely hasten it to end the agony.}
{2800}{}{为什么？但这不是很明显吗？核战争是人类的末日。今天所发生的只是它的死亡之痛，旷日持久，看不到尽头。但它会以死亡告终，绝对的结局。人们自己也部分意识到了这一点。这就是为什么他们试图消灭对方并完成这个过程。作为一个变种猎手，我自己也在不知不觉中促成了这一目标，因为那些互不杀戮的人，最终会发生变异，不育而死。这个结论是不可避免的，我只会催促它结束痛苦。}
#{2801}{}{So everybody dies and what happens then?}
{2801}{}{所以每个人都死了，然后呢？}

#{2950}{}{The Rebirth is getting stronger each day, gaining followers, resources, knowledge, technology. Soon no force will be able to stop us. Once I'm dead, nothing will change, the ghouls will continue with their quest with even greater dedication. Their yearning for a new life will drive them on and on, leaving them no time for rest. If they ever come to realize there is no hope for them, just like for anybody else, it will be in the moment when the last normal dies. Only ghouls will remain and they cannot continue to exist on their own.}
{2950}{}{重生一天比一天更强大，获得追随者、资源、知识、技术。很快任何力量都无法阻止我们。一旦我死了，一切都不会改变，僵尸们将以更大的奉献精神继续他们的追求。他们对新生活的渴望会驱使他们不断前进，让他们没有时间休息。如果他们意识到自己没有希望，就像其他人一样，那就是在最后一个正常人死去的那一刻。只有僵尸会留下来，他们不能继续独立生存。}
#{2951}{}{Someone could uncover the truth before that happens. And if you're dead, there'll be no one to stop them.}

{2955}{}{我要告诉你一些事情。}
#{3000}{}{Quite the contrary. With me, the last person who knows the truth will die. And the longer the period since the establishment of the Rebirth, the more reality will turn into a twisted history written and embellished by ghouls. Even if someone should find out a tiny sliver of truth, the others would tear them to pieces. The nature of my mission is that those who are fulfilling it are not aware of it. And that's how it will remain.}
{3000}{}{恰恰相反。和我在一起，最后一个知道真相的人将会死去。而重生建立的时间越长，现实就越会变成被僵尸书写和修饰的扭曲历史。即使有人发现了一点点真相，其他人也会把他们撕成碎片。我的使命的性质是，那些正在履行使命的人没有意识到这一点。这就是它将继续存在的方式。}

#{3151}{}{Listen to yourself! You want to help people, you always wanted to. But you see only the one awful way of doing it. You used to help people as a Hunter, in a way. You definitely believed that getting rid of mutants would help humans.}
{3151}{}{听你自己说！你总是想帮助别人。但你只看到一种可怕的方式。在某种程度上，你曾经作为一个猎人帮助过别人。你肯定相信消灭突变体会对人类有帮助。}
#{3152}{}{You're the only sane person and everybody is insane just because no one agrees with you?}
{3152}{}{你是唯一理智的人，每个人都因为没人同意你而疯狂？}
#{3200}{}{Of course I want to help humans. I want to end their misery, there is no other way! There can't be! If there was, I would've started none of this. But there isn't, I based the whole Rebirth on this reality, if there was another way...}

#{3201}{}{Then the Rebirth would thwart it. Mankind is damned because of you, the Rebirth is the thing that prevents mankind from rising again, taking all possibilities away from it.}
{3201}{}{然后重生会阻碍它。人类因为你而被诅咒，重生是阻止人类再次崛起的东西，夺走了一切可能。}

#{3300}{}{I... It's been so many years since I used that name... It's... Andrew. Yes, that's it. Andrew Ryamon, one of the best commanders of the Mutant Hunters.

I cannot undo the things I have caused, but I can stop them.

Its silent countdown will make sure it'll get all those damned mutants in here.}
{3350}{}{但那是。。。这就是突变体一直以来所追求的。不可能，我做了什么？！他们一定是骗了我，一直骗我，他们只想要变种人的统治！这就是他们想要的！那不对，我发誓我决不允许那样的事情发生。我无法挽回我造成的一切，但我可以阻止它们。[他开始在电脑上打字]再过五分钟，这整个地方就会在核爆炸中从它的自毁系统中蒸发掉。它的安静倒计时将确保它能把所有该死的变种人带到这里。}
#{3351}{}{Time to leave.}
{3351}{}{该走了。}
#{3400}{}{If you want, you can leave. I betrayed all genetically pure humans and I deserve to die in the radioactive flames along with all the mangy mutants. As one of them.}
{3400}{}{如果你愿意，你可以离开。我背叛了所有基因纯正的人类，我应该和所有肮脏的变种人一起死在放射性火焰中。作为他们中的一员。}
#{3401}{}{Farewell, Andrew.}
{3401}{}{再见，安德鲁。}
#{3450}{}{I didn't expect you'd be able to understand it. I've long ago come to terms with the fact that I'm the only one who has seen the whole truth. You are therefore the next who must die. Everybody will die, eventually.}
{3450}{}{我没想到你能理解。我很久以前就接受了这样一个事实：我是唯一一个看到全部真相的人。因此，你是下一个必须死去的人。最终每个人都会死。}

{3500}{}{我真的很感兴趣，既然我在你眼皮底下说了，你是否至少能理解一点真相。}
#{3501}{}{You're a madman that must be stopped!}
{3501}{}{你是个疯子，必须阻止！}
#{3502}{}{I'm with you, killing people is what I do.}
{3502}{}{我和你在一起，杀人是我的职责。}
#{3503}{}{I understand you. On my journey, all I've witnessed is misery. That is not worthy of being called life. The sooner it all ends, the better.}
{3503}{}{我理解你。在我的旅途中，我所目睹的只是痛苦。那不值得称为生命。一切越早结束越好。}
#{3504}{}{I don't know, maybe you could also tell me why you want to wipe out mankind.}
{3504}{}{我不知道，也许你也可以告诉我你为什么要消灭人类。}
#{3550}{}{Even though I expected this reaction, I'm sorry to hear it. But you could never stop my mission, even if you somehow managed to kill me. Do you think I'd tell you about it if even the slightest possibility of it existed?}
{3550}{}{尽管我预料到会有这种反应，但听到这个消息我还是很难过。但你不能阻止我的任务，即使你设法杀了我。你觉得我会告诉你这件事吗，即使有一点点可能？}
#{3551}{}{I will certainly try.}
{3551}{}{我一定会努力的。}
#{3600}{}{You understand nothing. You're an even bigger fool than I thought. I'm not doing it because I like it, but because it needs to be done. Your behavior only proves it. You are therefore the next who must die. Everybody will die, eventually.}
{3600}{}{你什么都不懂。你比我想象的还要蠢。我这样做不是因为我喜欢它，而是因为它需要去做。你的行为只能证明这一点。因此，你是下一个必须死去的人。最终每个人都会死。}
#{3601}{}{I will especially enjoy killing you.}
{3601}{}{我特别喜欢杀了你。}
#{3650}{}{Do you really understand? You've come to your senses, that's great! Once again an instrument for fulfilling my mission has been handed to me. I've underestimated you. But now that I know you understand, you can be the final part, the person who will finish the eradication of mankind once and for all.}
{3650}{}{你真的明白吗？你已经清醒过来了，太好了！我又一次得到了完成我使命的工具。我低估了你。但现在我知道你明白了，你可以成为最后一部分，一次彻底消灭人类的人。}
#{3651}{}{How?}
{3651}{}{怎么用？}
#{3700}{}{You'll ensure the destruction of Albuquerque. We've never been able to get anyone inside the city. We've always protected the reborn, and no ghoul will get further than to the city walls, but you've been inside. You can give us information about their defenses, and once we're prepared for the attack, you'll be there to carry out devastating sabotages. This time, Albuquerque will finally fall and Mutant Hunters will be defeated. Afterwards, there'll be no one with any chance of stopping the Rebirth. The ghouls will dominate the whole area and, without resistance, they'll spread all over the world until the very end. The end of all mankind.}
{3700}{}{你将确保阿尔伯克基的毁灭。我们从来没能在城里找到任何人。我们一直在保护重生的人，没有僵尸会比城墙更远，但你一直在里面。你可以给我们关于他们防御的信息，一旦我们准备好攻击，你就会在那里进行毁灭性的破坏。这一次，阿尔伯克基将最终沦陷，变种猎人将被击败。之后，就没有人有机会阻止重生了。僵尸将统治整个地区，如果没有抵抗，他们将遍布全世界，直到最后。全人类的末日。}

{3701}{}{好吧，我来做。}
#{3702}{}{I'm not doing it!}

{5306}{}{你为什么要说服我？}
#{5350}{}{It was necessary, just like in your case. He had to be stopped at all costs. He knew too much about the Rebirth and by making his treatment impossible, there was no way to help him. It would've been unfortunate if those ordered to stop him felt compassion for him, so I claimed his poor results were sabotage. I didn't make that decision lightly, but you are the one who is really responsible for it. He honored your friendship and at the same time dreamed of rebirth. For everybody. The crossing of his two loyalties had been bearing down on him too heavily.}
{5350}{}{这是必要的，就像你的情况一样。必须不惜一切代价阻止他。他对重生知道得太多了，使他的治疗无法进行，也没有办法帮助他。如果那些下令阻止他的人同情他，那就太不幸了，所以我声称他糟糕的结果是蓄意破坏。我不是轻易做出那个决定的，但你才是真正对此负责的人。他尊重你的友谊，同时梦想重生。为了每个人。他两个忠诚的交锋对他影响太大了。}
#{5351}{}{Thomas found and restored part of the data about the machine. Data you had erased.}
{5351}{}{托马斯发现并恢复了有关这台机器的部分数据。你删除的数据。}
#{5352}{}{The Twelfth spoke about the original data of the machine which confirm Thomas' claims.}
{5352}{}{第十二位谈到了机器的原始数据，这些数据证实了托马斯的说法。}

#{5355}{}{Why are you trying to persuade me?}
{5355}{}{你为什么要说服我？}
#{5400}{}{You have no idea what I had to go through to get here and get reborn. And I did it without any data, because there was none here. And you dare to question this? Don't you understand it's precisely talk like this that undermines our effort to really solve the problem? When instead of honest effort people here hope some lost files will solve everything for them or even prove to them they should not strive for achievement.}
{5400}{}{你不知道我要经历什么才能来到这里重生。我是在没有任何数据的情况下做的，因为这里没有数据。你敢质疑吗？难道你不明白，正是这样的言论破坏了我们真正解决问题的努力吗？当这里的人们希望一些丢失的档案能为他们解决所有的问题，甚至向他们证明他们不应该为成就而奋斗时，他们却没有诚实的努力。}
#{5401}{}{The Twelfth also talked about those files.}

{5404}{}{你为什么要说服我？}
#{5450}{}{Of course, the Twelfth could have talked about anything. His body is in the final stages of disintegration. His cellular structure disintegrates and the first cells to go are the ones in his brain. You yourself had an experience of the impact it may have.}
{5450}{}{当然，第十二个可以谈任何事。他的身体正处于解体的最后阶段。他的细胞结构解体，最先消失的细胞是他大脑中的细胞。你自己也经历过它可能带来的影响。}
#{5451}{}{More importantly, I gained an experience about the treatment the reborn were given.}

{5454}{}{你为什么要说服我？}
#{5500}{}{They became normal, healthy people and they were fine. Of course, they eventually paid for it with a painful death, but that was their sacrifice. Many ghouls of the Rebirth undergo the same without being reborn. If one can't fully comprehend this, one must live in the illusion that the reborn die painlessly under sedation. Such a person will never realize that if this was true, they couldn't get relevant data regarding the disintegration of the body. As far as the Eleventh and Twelfth are concerned, I was forced to move them to Blue 6 ahead of time just because of your treason. People stopped trusting the reborn, sooner or later, everyone would've asked for it.}
{5500}{}{他们变成了正常，健康的人，他们很好。当然，他们最终付出了痛苦的代价，但那是他们的牺牲。许多重生的僵尸经历同样的经历却没有重生。如果你不能完全理解这一点，你必须活在一种幻觉中，即重生者在镇静下无痛地死去。这样的人永远不会意识到，如果这是真的，他们无法获得有关身体解体的相关数据。至于第十一和第十二，因为你的叛国罪，我被迫提前把他们调到蓝6。人们不再相信重生，迟早每个人都会要求的。}

#{5550}{}{Here I am, a man of flesh and blood, standing right in front of you, indisputable proof of the fact that the whole process of rebirth can work properly. How about you try to find a solution instead of taking the easy way out and claiming such solution does not exist just because you don't see it?}
{5550}{}{我在这里，一个有血有肉的人，站在你面前，无可争辩地证明了整个重生过程都能正常运转。不如你试着找到一个解决办法，而不是采取简单的办法，并声称这样的解决办法不存在，只是因为你看不到它？}

#{6050}{}{You'll give the Rebirth the whole of Albuquerque. We've never been able to get anyone inside the city.

After this victory, there'll be nothing to stop us from accomplishing our ultimate goal.}

#{6950}{}{You think I am some kind of a villain that needs to confess of all his sins? Or a madman in need of someone telling him his actions mean something? My mission is righteous and I have never doubted it, even if it's me against the whole world!}
{6950}{}{你以为我是个需要忏悔所有罪恶的恶棍？或者一个疯子需要有人告诉他他的行为意味着什么？我的使命是正义的，我从来没有怀疑过，即使是我对抗全世界！}
#{6951}{}{So there is something else you're trying to achieve. Something you're hiding!}
{6951}{}{所以你还有别的目标。你在隐瞒什么！}
#{7000}{}{Well played, Thirteenth. It seems you're not a fool. I'll tell you what you want to hear, even though the chance that you'll truly understand is small. After all, I can easily kill you anytime.}
{7000}{}{打得好，十三号。看来你不是傻瓜。我会告诉你你想听什么，尽管你真正理解的机会很小。毕竟，我随时都可以杀了你。}
#{7001}{}{So what is this about?}
{7001}{}{这是怎么回事？}
#{7050}{}{It's about accomplishing something that has never been finished. It's about the final suffering. About the closing of a dead end of evolution. About the liberation from the claws of a tyrant. You can give it any name you like, but it's about the extermination of the whole of humanity.}
{7050}{}{它是关于完成一些从未完成的事情。是关于最后的痛苦。关于终结进化的死胡同。关于从暴君的魔爪中解放出来。你可以给它起任何名字，但它是关于整个人类的灭绝。}
#{7051}{}{What?!}
{7051}{}{什么？！}
#{7100}{}{In a way, I had perceived the truth even when I was a Mutant Hunter, but I fully realized it after my squad had been destroyed by a group of supermutants. I wandered the wasteland and stumbled upon this place, completely accidentally. And here, while I was recovering from my wounds, I started to realize that the efforts to exterminate all mutants had not been in order to save the so called pure humans. Its purpose was to rid the world of all humans. Sooner or later, most of them will mutate in some way. Humanity is an ulcer that must be removed and it came close to it once. Everybody should have died in the nuclear war and the world should have started again with something better. But it didn't happen. This pathetic species, so effective at wiping itself out, failed when it came to complete extermination. I understood it was my task to finish it.}
{7100}{}{在某种程度上，我甚至在我还是一个变种猎人的时候就已经意识到了真相，但在我的队伍被一群超级变种人摧毁之后，我完全意识到了这一点。我在荒地里漫步，无意中发现了这个地方。在这里，当我从伤口中恢复过来的时候，我开始意识到消灭所有变种人的努力并不是为了拯救所谓的纯人类。它的目的是消灭世界上所有的人类。它们中的大多数迟早会以某种方式变异。人性是一个溃疡，必须清除，它曾经接近它。每个人都应该死于核战争，世界应该从更好的开始。但没有发生。这可怜的物种，如此有效地消灭自己，失败时，它来完成灭绝。我明白完成它是我的任务。}
#{7101}{}{How does the Rebirth come into this?}
{7101}{}{重生是怎么来的？}
#{7150}{}{The fact that I was given a tool to fulfill my mission, forever confirmed its righteous purpose. Ghouls came here, and without them knowing, I blocked all the doors and watched them through the surveillance cameras. As they were getting further into the depths of the complex, I learned their purpose. They were looking for the machine I knew everything about from the records. Their desire of becoming normal humans once again was so strong there was no doubt they would do anything for it.}
{7150}{}{事实上，我得到了一个工具来完成我的使命，永远证实了它的正义目的。僵尸来到这里，在他们不知道的情况下，我堵住了所有的门，通过监控摄像头观察他们。当他们深入到建筑群的深处时，我明白了他们的目的。他们在找我从记录里知道的那台机器。他们再次成为正常人的愿望是如此强烈，毫无疑问他们会为此做任何事。}
#{7151}{}{So what did you do?}
{7151}{}{你做了什么？}
#{7160}{}{I deleted all data about the machine and anything related to it and acted as the Savior they were seeking, without them realizing it. They were so surprised their dream was really possible that they doubted nothing I told them. This was all that was needed to start things running. All I have to do is point the Rebirth in the right direction occasionally. In their search for the error in the process, the ghouls will exterminate every single normal and will be exterminated themselves, eventually. Then the mission will be finished.}
{7160}{}{我删除了所有关于这台机器的数据和任何与之相关的数据，并充当了他们正在寻找的救世主，而他们却没有意识到这一点。他们太惊讶了，他们的梦想真的有可能实现，以至于他们对我告诉他们的一切都毫不怀疑。这就是开始运转所需要的一切。我所要做的只是偶尔把重生指向正确的方向。在他们寻找错误的过程中，僵尸会消灭每一个正常人，并最终消灭自己。那任务就完成了。}
#{7161}{}{So the machine never really worked?}
{7161}{}{所以这台机器从来没有真正工作过？}
#{7162}{}{Why the annual rebirth?}
{7162}{}{为什么一年一度的重生？}
#{7163}{}{How can the Rebirth exterminate all humans in the world?}
{7163}{}{重生如何能消灭世界上所有的人类？}
#{7164}{}{I still don't understand why you're seeking the extermination of mankind.}
{7164}{}{我还是不明白你为什么要消灭人类。}
#{7165}{}{I will tell you something about that.}
{7165}{}{我要告诉你一些事情。}
#{7200}{}{You still have hope it once worked? The Vault-Tec scientists worked on the project concerning mutation and irradiation treatment for many years, and that machine is the result of their efforts. They reached the conclusion that permanent treatment isn't possible and terminated the project. I erased all records containing any information of this nature before the ghouls reached the fifth floor.}
{7200}{}{你还希望它曾经奏效吗？Vault-Tec的科学家们多年来一直致力于有关突变和辐射治疗的项目，而这台机器正是他们努力的结果。他们得出结论说永久治疗是不可能的，于是终止了这个项目。在僵尸到达五楼之前，我删除了所有包含这种性质信息的记录。}
#{7201}{}{Why the annual rebirth?}
{7201}{}{为什么一年一度的重生？}
#{7202}{}{How can the Rebirth exterminate all humans in the world?}
{7202}{}{重生如何能消灭世界上所有的人类？}
#{7203}{}{I still don't understand why you're seeking the extermination of mankind.}
{7203}{}{我还是不明白你为什么要消灭人类。}
#{7204}{}{I will tell you something about that.}
{7204}{}{我要告诉你一些事情。}
#{7250}{}{It had its proclaimed effects, there's no point denying that. But the truth is it's a perfect means of getting rid of unwanted individuals who are in the wrong places. They are willing and more than happy to get away from their jobs and get rid of their lives. Isn't that beautiful? For instance, the Twelfth discovered the remnants of the original data about the machine, but before he managed to find out what it was about, he had been reborn. You were friends with Thomas and thus you could potentially find out from him the fact that the machine isn't functional. I could not allow that, all soldiers must believe the rebirth is very close and they are fighting for a righteous cause, to make it available to all. They mustn't know that the donors they're obtaining by risking their own lives are in fact killed in experiments without any purpose.}
{7250}{}{它有它宣称的效果，没有必要否认这一点。但事实是，这是一个完美的方法，摆脱不受欢迎的人谁是在错误的地方。他们愿意并且非常乐意离开工作，摆脱生活。那不是很美吗？例如，第十二个发现了关于这台机器的原始数据的残余，但在他设法找出它是关于什么之前，他已经重生了。你和托马斯是朋友，因此你有可能从他那里发现这台机器不起作用的事实。我不能允许，所有的士兵必须相信重生是非常接近的，他们是为了正义的事业而战斗，使它对所有人。他们不应该知道，他们冒着生命危险获得的捐赠者实际上是在毫无目的的实验中被杀死的。}
#{7251}{}{So the machine never really worked?}
{7251}{}{所以这台机器从来没有真正工作过？}
#{7252}{}{How can the Rebirth exterminate all humans in the world?}
{7252}{}{重生如何能消灭世界上所有的人类？}
#{7253}{}{I still don't understand why you're seeking the extermination of mankind.}
{7253}{}{我还是不明白你为什么要消灭人类。}
#{7254}{}{I will tell you something about that.}
{7254}{}{我要告诉你一些事情。}
#{7300}{}{Why? But isn't that obvious? Nuclear war was mankind's doom. What's happening today is merely its death throe, protracted without an end in sight. But it can end in death, an absolute end. People themselves partly realize this. That's why they are trying to exterminate each other and finish this process. As a Mutant Hunter, I myself had unwittingly contributed to this goal, because those who do not kill each other, eventually mutate and die infertile. This conclusion is inevitable, I will merely hasten it to end the agony.}
{7300}{}{为什么？但这不是很明显吗？核战争是人类的末日。今天所发生的只是它的死亡之痛，旷日持久，看不到尽头。但它会以死亡告终，绝对的结局。人们自己也部分意识到了这一点。这就是为什么他们试图消灭对方并完成这个过程。作为一个变种猎手，我自己也在不知不觉中促成了这一目标，因为那些互不杀戮的人，最终会发生变异，不育而死。这个结论是不可避免的，我只会催促它结束痛苦。}
#{7301}{}{So everybody dies and what happens then?}
{7301}{}{所以每个人都死了，然后呢？}
#{7302}{}{You mean people don't deserve a chance?}
{7302}{}{你是说人们不应该有机会？}
#{7303}{}{There is always a possibility humanity will arise once again.}
{7303}{}{总有一种可能性人类会再次出现。}
#{7304}{}{How does the Rebirth come into this?}
{7304}{}{重生是怎么来的？}
#{7305}{}{I will tell you something about that.}
{7305}{}{我要告诉你一些事情。}
#{7350}{}{Then everything will be as it should be. We'll all be dead and the world will continue in a natural way. How precisely, I don't know. I am also human and therefore I won't be part of that.}
{7350}{}{然后一切都会恢复原样。我们都会死，世界将以自然的方式继续。确切地说，我不知道。我也是人类，因此我不会成为其中的一部分。}
#{7351}{}{You mean people don't deserve a chance?}

#{7354}{}{I will tell you something about that.}
{7354}{}{我要告诉你一些事情。}
#{7400}{}{We've had enough chances and humanity has already chosen its path. It chose the termination of its own existence. Maybe precisely because it realized how pathetic it is. It merely failed to carry it out properly. I am just finishing what humanity wished for.}
{7400}{}{我们已经有了足够的机会，人类已经选择了自己的道路。它选择了结束自己的存在。也许正是因为它意识到这是多么可悲。它只是没有正确地执行它。我刚刚完成了人类的愿望。}
#{7401}{}{So everybody dies and what happens then?}
{7401}{}{所以每个人都死了，然后呢？}
#{7402}{}{There is always a possibility humanity will arise once again.}

#{7403}{}{How does the Rebirth come into this?}
{7403}{}{重生是怎么来的？}
#{7404}{}{I will tell you something about that.}
{7404}{}{我要告诉你一些事情。}
#{7450}{}{The Rebirth is getting stronger each day, gaining followers, resources, knowledge, technology. Soon no force will be able to stop us. Once I'm dead, nothing will change, the ghouls will continue with their quest with even greater dedication. Their yearning for a new life will drive them on and on, leaving them no time for rest. If they ever come to realize there is no hope for them, just like for anybody else, it will be in the moment when the last normal dies. Only ghouls will remain and they cannot continue to exist on their own.}
{7450}{}{重生一天比一天更强大，获得追随者、资源、知识、技术。很快任何力量都无法阻止我们。一旦我死了，一切都不会改变，僵尸们将以更大的奉献精神继续他们的追求。他们对新生活的渴望会驱使他们不断前进，让他们没有时间休息。如果他们意识到自己没有希望，就像其他人一样，那就是在最后一个正常人死去的那一刻。只有僵尸会留下来，他们不能继续独立生存。}
#{7451}{}{Someone could uncover the truth before that happens. And if you're dead, there'll be no one to stop them.}
{7451}{}{有人可以在那之前揭开真相。如果你死了，没人能阻止他们。}
#{7452}{}{So the machine never really worked?}

{7454}{}{我还是不明白你为什么要消灭人类。}
#{7455}{}{I will tell you something about that.}
{7455}{}{我要告诉你一些事情。}
#{7500}{}{Quite the contrary. With me, the last person who knows the truth will die. And the longer the period since the establishment of the Rebirth, the more reality will turn into a twisted history written and embellished by ghouls. Even if someone should find out a tiny sliver of truth, the others would tear them to pieces. The nature of my mission is that those who are fulfilling it are not aware of it. And that's how it will remain.}
{7500}{}{恰恰相反。和我在一起，最后一个知道真相的人将会死去。而重生建立的时间越长，现实就越会变成被僵尸书写和修饰的扭曲历史。即使有人发现了一点点真相，其他人也会把他们撕成碎片。我的使命的性质是，那些正在履行使命的人没有意识到这一点。这就是它将继续存在的方式。}

#{7550}{}{Nonsense. They've had plenty of time for that and they just kept on destroying themselves. To think there is still hope for mankind is counting on a miracle that will never come. It's over. Period.}
{7550}{}{胡说。他们已经有足够的时间了，他们只是不断地摧毁自己。认为人类还有希望，就是指望一个永远不会出现的奇迹。结束了。句号。}

#{7602}{}{I'm with you, killing people is what I do.}

{7603}{}{我理解你。在我的旅途中，我所目睹的只是痛苦。那不值得称为生命。一切越早结束越好。}
#{7604}{}{I don't know, maybe you could also tell me why you want to wipe out mankind.}
{7604}{}{我不知道，也许你也可以告诉我你为什么要消灭人类。}
#{7650}{}{Even though I expected this reaction, I'm sorry to hear it. But you could never stop my mission, even if you somehow managed to kill me. Do you think I'd tell you about it if even the slightest possibility of it existed?}
{7650}{}{尽管我预料到会有这种反应，但听到这个消息我还是很难过。但你不能阻止我的任务，即使你设法杀了我。你觉得我会告诉你这件事吗，即使有一点点可能？}
#{7651}{}{I will certainly try.}
{7651}{}{我一定会努力的。}
#{7700}{}{You understand nothing. You're an even bigger fool than I thought. I'm not doing it because I like it, but because it needs to be done. Your behavior only proves it. You are therefore the next who must die. Everybody will die, eventually.}
{7700}{}{你什么都不懂。你比我想象的还要蠢。我这样做不是因为我喜欢它，而是因为它需要去做。你的行为只能证明这一点。因此，你是下一个必须死去的人。最终每个人都会死。}

{7750}{}{你真的明白吗？你已经清醒过来了，太好了！我又一次得到了完成我使命的工具。我低估了你。但现在我知道你明白了，你可以成为最后一部分，一次彻底消灭人类的人。}
#{7751}{}{How?}
{7751}{}{怎么用？}
#{7800}{}{You'll ensure the destruction of Albuquerque. We've never been able to get anyone inside the city. We've always protected the reborn and no ghoul will get further than to the city walls, but you've been inside. You can give us information about their defenses and once we're prepared for the attack, you'll be there to carry out devastating sabotages. This time, Albuquerque will finally fall and Mutant Hunters will be defeated. Afterwards, there'll be no one with any chance of stopping the Rebirth. The ghouls will dominate the whole area and, without resistance, they'll spread all over the world until the very end. The end of all mankind.}
{7800}{}{你将确保阿尔伯克基的毁灭。我们从来没能在城里找到任何人。我们一直在保护重生的人，没有僵尸会比城墙更远，但你一直在里面。你可以给我们关于他们防御的信息，一旦我们准备好攻击，你就会在那里进行毁灭性的破坏。这一次，阿尔伯克基将最终沦陷，变种猎人将被击败。之后，就没有人有机会阻止重生了。僵尸将统治整个地区，如果没有抵抗，他们将遍布全世界，直到最后。全人类的末日。}
#{7801}{}{Fine, I'll do it.}
{7801}{}{好吧，我来做。}
#{7802}{}{I'm not doing it!}

#{8800}{}{You entered into the machine willingly. No one, not even me, forced you to.

{8800}{}{你是自愿进入机器的。没有人，甚至我，强迫你这么做。我只是给你以最大可能的方式为重生服务的荣誉，你自愿接受了。如果你知道这个最高荣誉也意味着牺牲，你会更加渴望接受。你在指责我什么？}

#{8850}{}{I say this with a heavy heart, but Thomas was mentally ill. He couldn't cope with the fact he couldn't find the solution to our problem.

{8850}{}{我心情沉重地说这话，但托马斯有精神病。他无法应付找不到解决我们问题的办法的事实。再加上你的逃跑，他受的压力太大了。他的工作成果越来越没有意义了。我们想帮助他，给他提供医疗服务，让他康复，但他逃跑了。}

You were always a part of the Rebirth, the Thirteenth. Now that you are back, you can become a part again. They can all love you again, as simply as they started to hate you. They only need to see your repentance is true and your loyalty to the Rebirth renewed. You have a unique opportunity to prove it to them.}
{8950}{}{你以为我想杀了你？！我为什么要和你说话？命令你的死亡是必要的，因为你威胁重生，但这不是我所希望的。你永远是重生的一部分，第十三次。现在你回来了，你可以再次成为一部分。他们可以再次爱你，就像他们开始恨你一样。他们只需要看到你的忏悔是真实的，你的忠诚重生更新。你有一个独特的机会向他们证明这一点。}

#{9000}{}{You'll give the Rebirth the whole of Albuquerque. We've never been able to get anyone inside the city.

I'm sure you'll manage it even with your current mental limitations. This time, Albuquerque will finally fall, the Mutant Hunters will be defeated and we'll gain a great number of quality donors. After this victory, there'll be nothing to stop us from accomplishing our ultimate goal.}
{9000}{}{你会让整个阿尔伯克基重生。我们从来没能在城里找到任何人。我们一直在保护重生的人，没有僵尸会比城墙更远，但你一直在里面。你可以给我们关于他们防御的信息，一旦我们准备好攻击，你就会在那里进行毁灭性的破坏。我相信即使你现在的精神有缺陷，你也能应付。这一次，阿尔伯克基将最终沦陷，突变体猎人将被击败，我们将获得大量优质捐赠者。在这次胜利之后，没有什么能阻止我们实现我们的最终目标。}
