{116}{}{信使已经告诉我们破坏的事了。你已经被证明是一个有用的资产，所以我们不会杀你。这是你的薪水（给你2万美元）。孩子，如果我是你的话-我会在另一个城市躺几个星期。}

{125}{}{别担心钱的问题。比如说。。。20,000. 我认为应该这样做。我会从我自己的藏身处提供毒药，在这种场合我还会保留一些瓶子。。。}

{130}{}{杰出的！那就拿着烧瓶。你只要闯进车间把它倒进水箱里，我不管你怎么做。有传言说下面有一条隧道通往现场。。。手段由你决定，结果由我们买单。}

#{143}{}{Just like I thought, the sheriff doesn't have the balls to visit us in person. Send him my words, he's just a sissy with a mustache!}
{143}{}{就像我想的，警长没有勇气亲自来看我们。告诉他我的话，他只是个有胡子的娘娘腔！}
#{144}{}{Hmm... If you dislike the sheriff so much, I could consider a counteroffer for an adequate sum.}
