### {10}{}{Oh, it's you... Your father is very sick. His body has accumulated too much... Harmful stuff.}
{10}{}{哦，是你。。。你父亲病得很重。他的身体堆积得太多了。。。有害物质。}
### {11}{}{Doctor, is this the same thing that killed my mother and Catty's mother?}
{11}{}{医生，这是杀害我母亲和凯蒂母亲的同一件事吗？}
### {20}{}{Unfortunately, yes... I don't know how long will he last. Regular injections are of no use anymore. He needs a very powerful medicine, the kind of which I do not have.}
{20}{}{不幸的是，是的。。。我不知道他能坚持多久。定期注射已经没有用了。他需要一种非常强效的药，而我没有这种药。}
### {21}{}{Surely, you can do something!... Damn. There's an injured Son of the Gods, he asked me to bring him the medicine, which is called "Heal-Up".}
{21}{}{当然，你可以做点什么！。。。该死有一个受伤的神之子，他让我给他带药，这药叫做“治愈”。}
### {30}{}{Yes, I know. Why are you looking at me like that? The Gods informed me. Here - this is the last one.}
{30}{}{是的，我知道。你为什么那样看着我？上帝通知了我。这是最后一个。}
### {31}{}{I'll deliver the medicine and be right back! Please, look after my dad.}
{31}{}{我送药马上回来！请照顾我爸爸。}

### {100}{}{Oh, my Gods! I didn't recognize you! Where did you get this... Wow. Looks just like the one on guards! Very smart, very!}
{100}{}{天啊！我没认出你来！你从哪里得到的。。。哇！看起来就像那个站岗的！非常聪明，非常！}
### {104}{}{Oh, my Gods! I didn't recognize you! Where did you get this robe!? Looks just like the one on Heralds! Very smart, very!} 
{104}{}{天啊！我没认出你来！你从哪里弄来的这件长袍！？看起来就像赫拉尔德的那个！非常聪明，非常！}
### {101}{011}{Yes, I know, thanks, doc. How's my father? Does he feel better?}
{101}{011}{是的，我知道，谢谢，医生。我爸爸怎么样？他感觉好些了吗？}
### {102}{011}{Yeah, I'm that good. What's up with my dad?}
{102}{011}{是的，我很好。我爸爸怎么了？}
### {103}{999}{Talk later, doc. I have a lot of things I need to do.}	
{103}{999}{稍后再谈，医生。我有很多事情需要做。}
### {110}{}{Of course, of course. Your father is very sick. I know you went outside, and... You probably have a lot of questions, but I can say only one thing - the cause of his illness is called "radiation". It's like invisible rays coming through everything around us. But some bodies, like your mom's - or your dad's - accumulate these rays, like a filter.}  				
{110}{}{当然，当然。你父亲病得很重。我知道你出去了，然后。。。你可能有很多问题，但我只能说一件事――他生病的原因被称为“辐射”。这就像看不见的光线穿过我们周围的一切。但有些身体，比如你妈妈的――或者你爸爸的――像过滤器一样积累这些光线。}
### {111}{014}{Too many words, doc! Just tell me, how do I help him?}	
{111}{014}{话太多了，医生！告诉我，我该怎么帮他？}
### {112}{012}{Sounds difficult. Where do these rays come from?}			
{112}{012}{听起来很难。这些射线是从哪里来的？}
### {113}{999}{I'm bored. Let's leave this boring conversation for later.}	
{113}{999}{我很无聊。让我们把这无聊的谈话留待以后再说。}
### {120}{}{It's hard to say for sure, but it seems that these rays come from specific stones and metal. The tower beneath us is made of metal too, but only on the outside. On the inside, it is protected by anti-radiation stuff. I don't know for sure, engineers deal with it, not doctors.}   			
{120}{}{很难说，但这些射线似乎来自特定的石头和金属。我们下面的塔也是由金属制成的，但只是在外面。在内部，它受到防辐射材料的保护。我不确定是工程师处理的，而不是医生。}
### {121}{013}{En-gi-neers... Who? Are they the Sons of Gods too? Actually, who are these "Sons of Gods"? And who are the "Gods?" Do they live in the tower?} 
{121}{013}{嗯。。。谁他们也是众神之子吗？事实上，这些“神之子”是谁？那些“神”是谁？他们住在塔里吗？}
### {130}{}{You are asking too many dangerous questions. I would be glad to tell you the truth, but I'm afraid this knowledge will only make more problems. I'm sure you'll find it all out in your time.}
{130}{}{你问了太多危险的问题。我很乐意告诉你真相，但恐怕这些知识只会制造更多的问题。我相信你会在有生之年发现这一切的。}
### {131}{014}{Fine, I don't have time for it anyway. How can I help my dad?} 
{131}{014}{好吧，反正我没有时间。我该怎么帮我爸爸？}
### {132}{999}{Great! Thanks for the help. I'll go figure everything out right now.} 
{132}{999}{太棒了谢谢你的帮助。我现在就去想办法。}
### {140}{}{There's only one thing that may - MAY - help your father. It's called "Antiradine". As I've heard, this drug can handle even the radiation poisoning this severe. You can get it only in one place - in the ruins of the old "Rainbow Pharmaceuticals" factory. Don't let the word "ruins" fool you - this factory is very much active and operating. They have a vile and vicious raider in charge, but I fail to see any other way to help your dad.}		
{140}{}{只有一件事可以――也许――帮助你的父亲。它被称为“Antiradine”。据我所知，这种药物甚至可以治疗如此严重的辐射中毒。你只能在一个地方买到它――在旧的“彩虹制药”工厂的废墟中。不要让“废墟”这个词骗了你――这家工厂非常活跃，运转良好。他们有一个卑鄙恶毒的袭击者负责，但我看不出有什么其他方法可以帮助你爸爸。}
### {141}{015}{So, I need to walk across the wastelands to another gang of bandits and ask them to give me rare and, obviously, not so cheap medicine?!} 	
{141}{015}{所以，我需要穿过荒原走到另一帮土匪那里，请他们给我罕见的，显然不是那么便宜的药？！}
### {142}{016}{Raiders again? But... Goddamit. Someone has to answer for all this. Okay doc, tell me how to find them.} 			
{142}{016}{又是袭击者？但是该死。必须有人来为这一切负责。好的，医生，告诉我如何找到它们。}
### {150}{}{What do you want me to do about it? Okay, here's another way - go to the surface and knock into the tower doors, then ask them to cure your father. The "Olympus" definitely possesses such kind of medicine - only they don't care about anyone, be it your father, me, or you!}
{150}{}{你想让我怎么办？好吧，还有另一种方法――到地面去敲塔门，然后让他们治好你的父亲。“奥林匹斯”绝对拥有这样的药物――只是他们不在乎任何人，无论是你的父亲、我还是你！}
### {151}{016}{I see. Well, if there's no other way - tell me how to find these "rainbow raiders".}  	
{151}{016}{我明白了。好吧，如果没有其他办法的话――告诉我如何找到这些“彩虹突袭者”。}
### {160}{}{Why tell? Didn't you get accustomed to your organizer? [winks] I had one just like it once... Okay, look. [Pat takes your organizer and shows what buttons to press and what they do] Here, the factory's coordinates are now on your map. Remember - you should hurry with finding the cure. I don't think your father will last longer than a couple of weeks.}		
{160}{}{为什么要说？你不是习惯了你的组织者吗？我有过一次。。。好的，看。[Pat拿着你的组织者，展示按下什么按钮以及它们做什么]在这里，工厂的坐标现在在你的地图上。记住――你应该赶紧找到治疗方法。我认为你父亲的寿命不会超过几个星期。}
### {161}{017}{I see. Antiradine then. I'll get it. Hang on, dad...}  			
{161}{017}{我明白了。那是安替拉定。我会拿到的。等一下，爸爸。。。}
### {162}{018}{Understood. Thanks for the bits of advice, doc, I'll try not to be late.}  			
{162}{018}{明白了。谢谢你的建议，医生，我尽量不迟到。}
### {163}{018}{Uh, we'll see how it goes. I wouldn't want to die looking for some stupid medicines. I'm off.}    	
{163}{018}{我们拭目以待。我不想死后去找一些愚蠢的药。我走了。}
### {170}{}{You're just like your father. [he gives a tired smile] Go, and good luck.}  			
{170}{}{你就像你爸爸一样。[他疲惫地笑了笑]去吧，祝你好运。}
### {171}{999}{[leave]}   	
{171}{999}{[离开]}
### {180}{}{I said what I had to. The rest is up to you.}  					
{180}{}{我说了我必须说的。剩下的由你决定。}
### {181}{999}{[leave]}   	
{181}{999}{[离开]}
### {200}{}{Huh? Oh, it's you again, }   	
{200}{}{嗯？哦，又是你，}
### {201}{}{. I still can't get accustomed to your new appearance, hehe. What do you need?}  				
{201}{}{。我还是不习惯你的新样子，呵呵。你需要什么？}
### {202}{030}{Doc, how's my father?}
{202}{030}{医生，我父亲怎么样？}
### {203}{021}{I was thinking - maybe you need some help?}   
{203}{021}{我在想――也许你需要一些帮助？}
### {204}{023}{About your request...}
{204}{023}{关于您的请求。。。}
### {205}{Barter}{Show me what do you have in stock.}
{205}{Barter}{让我看看你们有什么存货。}
### {206}{999}{Uh, no, nothing. I better go.}
{206}{999}{不，什么都没有。我最好走了。}

### {207}{040}{Doc, I have some... Unusual female patient for you.}
{207}{040}{医生，我有一些。。。不寻常的女性患者。}

### {209}{}{Yes... Huh? What?}
{209}{}{对嗯？什么}
### {210}{}{Help? Hmm, why not, actually... Yes, seriously, do something helpful. But you need good hands and some medical skills. Yeah... You know how it is - we have all kinds of traumas, dislocations, and sprains here. Someone stucks something in the wrong place - and here it is, a new injury. And this someone can't work and feels pain. And there's only me here. It's not enough... So, would you help?} 
{210}{}{帮助嗯，为什么不呢，实际上。。。是的，说真的，做一些有益的事情。但你需要好的双手和一些医疗技能。是 啊你知道这是怎么回事――我们这里有各种各样的创伤、错位和扭伤。有人把东西卡在错误的地方――现在是，一个新的损伤。这个人不能工作，感到痛苦。这里只有我一个人。这还不够。。。那么，你能帮忙吗？}
### {211}{022}{Do you need me to fix dislocated wrists or something? Of course, I'll help, no problem!}  			
{211}{022}{你需要我帮你修复手腕脱臼吗？当然，我会帮忙的，没问题！}
### {212}{022}{You mean, to do a medic's job? I'm not sure... But I could try, why not.}  		
{212}{022}{你是说，做医生的工作？我不确定。。。但我可以尝试，为什么不呢。}
### {213}{999}{To take care of sick and injured? Hell no, I don't have time for this. A lot of other things to do.}    	
{213}{999}{照顾伤病？不，我没有时间。还有很多其他事情要做。}
### {220}{}{That's wonderful! Okay, listen - run around the Farms and Maintenance level. If you see someone lying around and groaning, try to get them back on their feet. Not by force, of course, don't make it worse for them. Help at least six, and return to me. Meanwhile, I'll think about how to thank you for this. [he winks]}  			
{220}{}{太棒了！好的，听我说，在农场和维护级别上跑一圈。如果你看到有人躺在那里呻吟，试着让他们重新站起来。当然，不要用武力，不要让事情变得更糟。至少帮六个人，然后回来找我。同时，我会考虑如何为此感谢你。[他眨眼]}
### {221}{PetsHelper}{I see, I see. Okay, off to heal injured and sprained.}  				
{221}{PetsHelper}{我明白了，我明白了。好的，去治疗受伤和扭伤。}
### {222}{PetsHelper}{Assignment is taken, doc. See you soon!}   
{222}{PetsHelper}{作业已完成，文档。再见！}
### {223}{999}{Six!? Too much, if you ask me. I was thinking about bringing you a couple of sick kids or something. Nah, some other time.}
{223}{999}{六太过分了，如果你问我的话。我想给你带几个生病的孩子什么的。不，改天吧。}
### {230}{}{So? How are my- I mean, your patients?}
{230}{}{所以我的病人怎么样？}
### {231}{999}{I'm working on it. Surprisingly, not many injured around here. I'll go look for more.}  		
{231}{999}{我正在努力。令人惊讶的是，这里没有多少人受伤。我会去找更多的。}
### {232}{024}{ are healed in total. Not without some accidental mistakes, but now everything is alright.}    
{232}{024}{全部治愈。并非没有一些偶然的错误，但现在一切都好了。}
### {233}{024}{I healed every injured I could find. Now they are back to work.}  					
{233}{024}{我治愈了我能找到的每一个伤员。现在他们又开始工作了。}
### {240}{}{Good, that's good. It's still a drop in the bucket, but at least now I can have one day off - and this means a lot! I can teach you some medical skills or give you 3 "Heal-Up" and 2 "Poison-Out". What will it be?}  	
{240}{}{很好，很好。这仍然是杯水车薪，但至少现在我可以休息一天――这意味着很多！我可以教你一些医术，或者给你3个“治愈”和2个“排毒”。会是什么？}
### {241}{025}{The skills are always handy! Share your skills with me.}  					
{241}{025}{技能总是得心应手！与我分享你的技能。}
### {242}{026}{A useful meds, doc! If I'm going to fight poisonous scorpions, they will help me a lot. I take them.} 
{242}{026}{一种有用的药，医生！如果我要和毒蝎子搏斗，它们会帮我很多忙。我接受它们。}
### {243}{027}{I can't choose... Can I have both?}   
{243}{027}{我不能选择。。。我可以两者都要吗？}
### {250}{}{Okay, listen then... When you see a nasty wound... [he starts methodically and thoroughly describe all necessary actions for administering first aid] Okay, I hope this information comes in handy!} 	
{250}{}{好吧，听着。。。当你看到一个讨厌的伤口。。。[他开始有条不紊地、彻底地描述所有必要的急救措施]好吧，我希望这些信息能派上用场！}
### {251}{999}{Thanks, doc. Although, I hope this information DOESN'T come in handy. See you.}  		
{251}{999}{谢谢，医生。不过，我希望这些信息不会派上用场。再见}
### {260}{}{Good choice! Especially, "Poison-Out" - it has no analogs, and if you don't remove poison in time, it could be fatal to you.}					
{260}{}{不错的选择！尤其是“排毒”――它没有类似物，如果你不及时清除毒素，它可能会对你致命。}
### {261}{999}{Thanks, doc. I hope I won't have to use them. See you!}  		
{261}{999}{谢谢，医生。我希望我不用使用它们。再见}
### {2701}{}{What a sly! No, it doesn't work that way. Either I spend time teaching you or give you the meds. Oh, I have an idea! How about I just thank you and we call it a day?}
{2701}{}{真狡猾！不，那样不行。要么我花时间教你，要么给你吃药。哦，我有个主意！我只是谢谢你，我们就到此为止吧？}
### {271}{025}{Okay, I get it! Teach me some medical skills.}  			
{271}{025}{好的，我明白了！教我一些医术。}
### {272}{026}{No, a deal is a deal, I take meds!!}  				
{272}{026}{不，交易就是交易，我吃药！！}
### {2702}{}{It is a little unfair, don't you think? Okay, here, take your meds. And about skills - when you see a nasty wound... [he starts methodically and thoroughly describe all necessary actions for administering first aid] Okay, I hope all of this comes in handy!} 					
{2702}{}{这有点不公平，你不觉得吗？好的，给你，吃药。关于技能――当你看到一个严重的伤口。。。[他开始有条不紊地、彻底地描述所有必要的急救措施]好吧，我希望所有这些都能派上用场！}
### {273}{999}{Thanks, doc, nice to do business with you. [wink]}
{273}{999}{谢谢你，医生，很高兴和你做生意。[眨眼]}

### {274}{999}{You know what, doc? Keep the meds and your knowledge to yourself. You would need it more around here, and I don't have time for lectures. See you.}  					
{274}{999}{你知道吗，医生？把药物和你的知识留给自己。你在这里会更需要它，而我没有时间讲课。再见}
### {3001}{}{Your father is barely holding up! If you won't bring me "Antiradine" soon, it can be too late.}   	
{3001}{}{你爸爸几乎撑不住了！如果你不尽快给我带来“安替拉定”，那就太晚了。}
### {301}{999}{I'm trying my best to find it, doc. Help my father to hold on for a little more, I'll be back soon!}    		
{301}{999}{医生，我正在尽力找它。帮我爸爸再坚持一会儿，我很快就会回来的！}
### {302}{031}{Here, here is it! I brought the "Antiradine"! [give Pat the syringe]}    			
{302}{031}{给，给！我带来了“Antiradine”！[给帕特注射器]}
### {3002}{}{John is getting better, nothing to worry about. He is still very weak, but your brother Kirk keeps an eye on him. I think your father will be alright. Give him time.}
{3002}{}{约翰正在好转，没什么可担心的。他仍然很虚弱，但你哥哥柯克一直在看着他。我想你父亲会没事的。给他时间。}
### {303}{020}{So good to hear good news, doc. I have some questions though.}  				
{303}{020}{很高兴听到这个好消息，医生。不过我还有一些问题。}
### {304}{999}{Very good. I'm counting on you, doc.}    	
{304}{999}{很好。我指望你，医生。}
### {3003}{}{I... I am truly sorry. You didn't make it in time.}    				
{3003}{}{我…我真的很抱歉。你没有及时赶到。}
### {305}{999}{I tried... I did everything I could. Father...}    				
{305}{999}{我试过了。。。我尽了我所能。父亲}
### {306}{999}{I tried... I did everything I could. [the syringe of "Antiradine" pops, crushed in your fist] Father...} 
{306}{999}{我试过了。。。我尽了我所能。[“安替拉定”的注射器爆裂，压在你的拳头里]父亲。。。}
### {310}{}{What took you so long? What if it's too late? I hope it isn't... Give me that. [Pat puts a few drops into your dad's rolled eyes. John's body starts to shake uncontrollably] Don't stand there, help me to hold him! There, there, everything is going to be alright, John. [the seizure stops. Pat stands up] The condition is stable... That means he'll get better. Of course, he had to be taken care of, and periodically take drops of "Antiradine", but I think your brother Kirk will handle it just fine.}
{310}{}{你怎么花了这么长时间？如果太晚了怎么办？我希望不是。。。给我这个。[帕特往你爸爸翻白眼里滴了几滴。约翰的身体开始不受控制地颤抖]别站在那里，帮我抱他！那里，那里，一切都会好起来的，约翰。[癫痫发作停止。帕特站了起来]情况稳定。。。这意味着他会好起来的。当然，他必须得到照顾，并定期服用“安替拉定”，但我认为你哥哥柯克会处理得很好。}
### {311}{032}{Phew... Thank Gods... I mean, it's good that I made it here in time. How long will it take for him to recover?}					
{311}{032}{呜呜。。。感谢上帝。。。我的意思是，我及时赶到这里真是太好了。他需要多长时间才能康复？}
### {312}{033}{Great, one less problem to worry about. I had to go through a lot to pull dad from the brink - yet he ended up there not by my fault. We are in danger because of their fault... Because of the "Gods".}  		
{312}{033}{太好了，少了一个需要担心的问题。为了把爸爸从悬崖边上拉下来，我经历了很多，但他最终却不是我的错。由于他们的过错，我们处于危险之中。。。因为“上帝”。}
### {313}{999}{Very good, because I need something else to do.}    			
{313}{999}{很好，因为我需要做其他事情。}
### {320}{}{I can't even assume... There were no such cases in my practice. It can potentially take months. Of course, if he was in the "Olympus", they would put him back on his feet in a week... But we are here, and we don't have the necessary equipment... I mean... Uhh...} 
{320}{}{我甚至不能假设。。。在我的实践中没有这样的案例。这可能需要几个月的时间。当然，如果他在“奥林巴斯”，他们会在一周内让他重新站起来。。。但我们在这里，我们没有必要的设备。。。我的意思是。。。嗯。。。}
### {321}{033}{Again! It's always about the "Olympus"! If there's a problem, then the tower holds salvation! Is it really inhabited by the Gods?}  				
{321}{033}{再一次它总是关于“奥林巴斯”！如果有问题，那么这座塔就是拯救之塔！它真的有众神居住吗？}
### {330}{}{I know about the Gods not more than you. No one saw them. We heard their orders, saw the defiants they have killed, but no one has ever met them. Maybe you could talk to Herald Gregorius about it?}
{330}{}{我对上帝的了解并不比你多。没有人看见他们。我们听到了他们的命令，看到了他们杀害的反抗者，但从未有人见过他们。也许你可以和《先驱报》的格雷戈里乌斯谈谈这件事？}
### {331}{999}{I could start from there. I will get to the truth.}    
{331}{999}{我可以从那里开始。我会了解真相的。}
### {332}{999}{I will definitely figure it all out!}
{332}{999}{我一定会想清楚的！}

### {340}{}{Doc, look, I brought a "RadOut"! Everyone says it's good [hand doctor the injector]}
{340}{}{医生，看，我带了一个“RadOut”！每个人都说这很好[手医注射器]}
### {341}{}{I've found a great potion from radiation, a well-known folk remedy! [give doctor "Wild Potion"]}
{341}{}{我从辐射中找到了一种很好的药剂，一种著名的民间疗法！[给医生“野药水”]}
### {342}{}{Here, I brought some anti-radiation pills! [show your "Radiom" pills]}
{342}{}{给你，我带来了一些抗辐射药！[出示你的“Radiom”药丸]}

### {343}{}{[Pat furiously waves hands] No, no-no-no! I told you clearly - it's "ANTIRADINE"! You should look for it in Rainbow Raiders, and it's the only thing that can help your father! Oh, Gods... If you can't remember it, write it down!}
{343}{}{[帕特愤怒地挥手]不，不，不！我说得很清楚――这是“反兴奋剂”！你应该在《彩虹奇兵》中寻找它，它是唯一能帮助你父亲的东西！天啊。。。如果你记不住了，就写下来！}
### {344}{999}{I get it. I'll go look for this... What was it again?}	
{344}{999}{我明白了，我去找这个。。。又是什么？}


### {400}{}{Unusual, you say? I bet someone from the Maintenance level is sticking their hands where they are not supposed to again...}
{400}{}{你说不寻常？我敢打赌，维护级别的人会把手伸到不应该再伸到的地方。。。}
### {401}{041}{No, actually this patient is somewhere far away from here. We have to venture outside.}
{401}{041}{不，实际上这个病人在离这里很远的地方。我们不得不冒险外出。}
### {402}{043}{Actually, I mean the savage woman, she lives in the mountains to the north. She has a nasty rotten wound.}
{402}{043}{事实上，我指的是那个野蛮的女人，她住在北边的山上。她有一个严重腐烂的伤口。}

### {410}{}{I haven't been outside in a really long time, I'm afraid that my old body won't handle the traveling.}
{410}{}{我已经很久没有出门了，我担心我的老身体无法应付旅行了。}
### {411}{}{Don't worry, I know how to get there safely. Don't you want to breathe the fresh air of freedom again?}
{411}{}{别担心，我知道如何安全到达那里。难道你不想再次呼吸自由的新鲜空气吗？}
### {412}{}{I'll have you protected, I promise. That woman really needs your help.}
{412}{}{我保证会保护你的。那个女人真的需要你的帮助。}

### {420}{}{Well, if you know safe paths and protect me... Okay then! Would be nice to remember the old days and shake off some rust, right? Let's move out, while I didn't change my mind. But promise to take me back!}
{420}{}{好吧，如果你知道安全的道路并保护我…好吧！如果能回忆起过去的日子，摆脱一些铁锈，那就太好了，对吧？让我们搬出去吧，而我没有改变主意。但是答应带我回去！}
### {421}{}{Great! Just keep close to me.}
{421}{}{太棒了只要靠近我。}
### {422}{999}{You know, I need to do something around here. I'll be back.}
{422}{999}{你知道，我需要在这里做点什么。我会回来的。}

### {430}{}{Not very convincing. Why would I go somewhere far to save someone I don't even know. No, I'm staying here.}
{430}{}{不是很有说服力。为什么我要去很远的地方去救一个我甚至都不认识的人。不，我待在这里。}
### {431}{}{I can relate... Okay, I need to go.}
{431}{}{我能理解。。。好的，我得走了。}
### {432}{}{You have no compassion, doc! I'll handle it myself then.}

There, there, everything is going to be alright, John. [the seizure stops. Pat stands up] The condition is stable... That means he'll get better. Of course, he had to be taken care of, and periodically take drops of "Antiradine", but I think your brother Kirk will handle it just fine.}
