#{100}{}{You see the leader.}

#{101}{}{You see the leader of the convoy.}
{101}{}{你看到车队的队长了。}
#{102}{}{See you around... Partner.}
{102}{}{回头见...合伙人。}
#{110}{}{Who the hell are you?}
{110}{}{你到底是谁？}
#{111}{}{I'm just passing by. What are you carrying?}
{111}{}{我只是路过。你带着什么？}
#{112}{}{I'm, uh, here to collect the product.}
{112}{}{我是来收货的。}
#{113}{}{I know why you're here. I present a better offer: sell the weapons to me and walk away alive.}
{113}{}{我知道你为什么在这里。我提出了一个更好的提议：把武器卖给我，然后活着离开。}
#{114}{}{Oh, I'm just out for a walk. Bye.}
{114}{}{哦，我只是出去走走。再见。}
#{120}{}{Passing by? All the way out here? At night? ...you just keep on passing, then. Nothing to see here.}
{120}{}{路过？一直到这里？在晚上...那你就继续过去吧。这里没什么可看的。}
#{121}{}{Oh yeah? [he eyes you suspiciously] I was told to wait for someone to call on the radio, but I haven't heard anything. What's going on?}
{121}{}{哦，是吗？[他怀疑地看着你]有人叫我等着有人打电话来，但我什么也没听到。发生什么事？}
#{122}{}{}
{122}{}{}
#{123}{}{Uh...}
{123}{}{Uh...}
#{124}{}{We ran into technical problems with the radio. Do you have the product or not?}
{124}{}{我们的收音机遇到了技术问题。你有没有这个产品？}
#{125}{}{}
{125}{}{}
#{126}{}{Tell me the password.}
{126}{}{告诉我密码。}
#{127}{}{Err... "sons of bitches"?}
{127}{}{呃……”“狗娘养的”？}
#{128}{}{Password? No one told me about a password.}
{128}{}{密码？没有人告诉我密码。}
#{129}{}{[The caravaneers ready their rifles and look around warily] Alright, what the hell's going on?! If you're not from Bertolini, who are you?}
{129}{}{[商队准备好步枪，小心地环顾四周]好吧，到底怎么回事？！如果你不是伯托里尼人，你是谁？}
#{130}{}{Bertolini's dead. You came all this way for nothing. But I know about your deal and I'm ready to make a counter-offer.}
{130}{}{贝托里尼死了。你大老远跑来都是白来的。但我知道你的交易，我准备还价。}
#{131}{}{I represent Bertolini's competitors. We're a lot more powerful than he is. It's in your best interest to work with us.}
{131}{}{我代表贝托里尼的竞争对手。我们比他强大得多。与我们合作对你最有利。}
#{132}{}{Hmm. Well, we came all the way from the Boneyard with these. We're sure as hell not going to take them back. Fine, I'll sell them to you, but don't think you're getting a discount.}
{132}{}{嗯。好吧，我们带着这些从墓地远道而来。我们肯定不会把他们带回去的。好吧，我把它们卖给你，但别以为你会打折。}
#{133}{}{I'll sell it to you for $}
{133}{}{我会把它卖给你的$}
#{134}{}{My boss would like to conduct business with you in the future, but these prices are unreasonable. If you want to take advantage of this opportunity, you will lower them.}
{134}{}{我的老板将来想和你们做生意，但这些价格不合理。如果你想利用这个机会，你会降低他们。}
#{135}{}{Your loss. My boss would like to conduct business with you in the future...}
{135}{}{你的损失。我的老板将来想和你做生意...}
#{136}{}{I have another idea: leave the product and walk away, and I'll allow you to keep your lives.}
{136}{}{我有另一个想法：离开产品，走开，我会让你保住你的生命。}
#{137}{}{I don't like that price. I think I'd prefer to take the product and your lives. [Attack.]}
{137}{}{我不喜欢这个价格。我想我更愿意接受产品和你的生命。[攻击]}
#{138}{}{Hold on, I'll get the money.}
{138}{}{等等，我去拿钱。}
#{139}{}{[The guards count the money and allow you to check the weapons in the boxes] Alright, we're done. Tell your boss this isn't going to happen again. We'd wanted to set up a long-term thing, but this is way too sketchy. We're leaving now.}
{139}{}{[警卫清点钱，让你检查箱子里的武器]好了，我们结束了。告诉你老板这不会再发生了。我们本想制定一个长期的计划，但这太草率了。我们要走了。}
#{140}{}{[Next]}
{140}{}{[下一步]}
#{141}{}{Sounds good... For now. But if there's trouble next time, it'll be the last. Clear?}
{141}{}{听起来不错...现在。但如果下次有麻烦的话，那就是最后一次了。明白了吗？}
#{142}{}{You managed to knock $500 off the price per order. The savings made its way back into your pockets.}
{142}{}{你设法把每份订单的价格降低了500美元。积蓄又回到了你的口袋里。}
#{143}{}{Are you kidding me? Sit down, kiddo, I've been trading since before you were alive and that's just about the worst deal I've ever heard. That's the price, take it or leave it.}
{143}{}{你在开玩笑吧？坐下，孩子，在你还活着之前我就开始交易了，这是我听过的最糟糕的交易。这就是价格，要么接受要么放弃。}
#{144}{}{Oh, is that right? [he puts his hands on his hips and narrows his eyes] Is this your first shakedown, kid? Because it sure as hell ain't mine. I don't care what kind of backup you've got, we don't scare easy. So, tell your friends to go home, so we could talk like adults.}
{144}{}{哦，是这样吗？[他把手放在臀部，眯起眼睛]这是你第一次被打倒吗，孩子？因为它肯定不是我的。我不管你有什么后援，我们都不怕。所以，告诉你的朋友们回家，这样我们就可以像大人一样说话了。}
#{150}{}{Where do you get the weapons?}
{150}{}{你从哪里弄到武器的？}
#{151}{}{From a workshop in the Boneyard. They're putting together guns using pre-war blueprints. Tough cookies, the lot of 'em. They've been in business about ten years, but outside of some commission work, they mostly make guns for themselves.}
{151}{}{从骨灰场的一个车间。他们在用战前的蓝图组装枪支。他们已经做了十年的生意，但是除了一些委托工作之外，他们主要是为自己制造枪支。}
#{152}{}{Are you one of them?}
{152}{}{你是他们中的一员吗？}
#{153}{}{Nah, those guys barely ever leave the workshop. We're the Far Go Traders, from the Hub. We don't usually come all the way out here.}
{153}{}{不，那些家伙几乎从不离开车间。我们是远离中心的远道商人。我们通常不会大老远跑来这里。}
#{154}{}{So what are they? Weapons fanatics?}
{154}{}{它们是什么？武器狂热分子？}
#{155}{}{Not quite. It's just the only thing they know how to do... Not including their criminal pasts. They came to Boneyard some time ago hoping to settle down. They holed up in an old weapons factory and dug a moat full of radioactive goo. I guess the old blueprints must have been kicking around in there. At first, they didn't talk to anyone, but eventually they started selling guns and ammo for food. Basically, the weapons are the only thing keeping them afloat.}
{155}{}{不完全是。这是他们唯一知道的...不包括他们犯罪的过去。他们前段时间来到骨场希望安顿下来。他们躲在一个旧武器厂里，挖了一条满是放射性粘液的护城河。我猜那些旧的蓝图一定是在里面到处乱窜。起初，他们不跟任何人说话，但最终他们开始卖枪和弹药当食物。基本上，武器是唯一能让他们漂浮的东西。}
#{1110}{}{Who the hell are you?}
{1110}{}{你到底是谁？}
#{1112}{}{I'm, uh, here to collect the product.}
{1112}{}{我是来收货的。}
#{1130}{}{Bertolini's dead. You came all this way for nothing. But I know about your deal and I'm ready to make a counter-offer.}
{1130}{}{贝托里尼死了。你大老远跑来都是白来的。但我知道你的交易，我准备还价。}
#{1153}{}{Nah, those guys barely ever leave the workshop. We're the Far Go Traders, from the Hub. We don't usually come all the way out here.}
{1153}{}{不，那些家伙几乎从不离开车间。我们是远离中心的远道商人。我们通常不会大老远跑来这里。}
