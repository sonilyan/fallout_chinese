#{307}{}{Fuck, it's all fucked up.}
{307}{}{妈的，都搞砸了。}
#{500}{}{[He takes a long drag on his cigarette and gives you a dumbass smirk.] Yeah?}
{500}{}{[他吸了很久烟，傻笑了你一声]是吗？}
#{501}{}{Hi there. I'd like to ask you a few things.}
{501}{}{你好。我想问你几件事。}
#{502}{}{Smokey man!}
{502}{}{烟熏人！}
#{503}{}{Oh never mind.}
{503}{}{哦，没关系。}
#{504}{}{Bye bye man... Smokeys yucky.}
{504}{}{再见，伙计……烟真恶心。}
#{505}{}{I've gotten those smokes for you.}
{505}{}{我给你买了烟。}
#{550}{}{Ask? Let me tell you just one thing... [He has a coughing fit, his cigarette falls down.] Damn. Just one thing, but it's a very important thing. You can ask whatever, but answers, pal, answers is what you have to pay for around here... [He flashes his half-dumb smile again.] And I bet that's probably the last thing that you'll learn for free in this town.}
{550}{}{问？让我告诉你一件事……[他咳嗽，香烟掉下来了]该死。只有一件事，但这是一件非常重要的事。你可以问任何问题，但是答案，伙计，答案是你在这里必须付出的……[他又露出半哑的微笑]我敢打赌这可能是你在这个镇上免费学到的最后一件事。}
#{551}{}{Ask? Let me tell you just one thing... [He has a coughing fit, his cigarette falls down.] Damn. Just one thing, but it's a very important thing.

#{552}{}{Look, either you talk or I'll have to beat the answers out of you!}
{552}{}{听着，要么你开口，要么我把你的答案打出来！}
#{553}{}{I see. Sorry to hear that. I don't have that many spare caps.}
{553}{}{我懂了。很抱歉听到这个消息。我没有那么多多余的瓶盖。}
#{554}{}{OK. How much will a short conversation cost me?}
{554}{}{好 啊。一次简短的谈话要花我多少钱？}
#{600}{}{What? [He watches you distrustfully.] Well do you want something or not?}
{600}{}{什么？[他不信任地看着你]你到底想要什么？}
#{601}{}{Smokey make! Give me, give me!}
{601}{}{Smokey make！给我，给我！}
#{602}{}{What this yucky townie?}
{602}{}{这个讨厌的镇子是什么？}
#{603}{}{Uh-uh. Bye bye.}
{603}{}{呃，呃。再见。}
#{650}{}{Ah, so you wanna smokey? Gimme 10 caps and you can make smokey, OK? Understand?}
{650}{}{啊，你想抽烟吗？给我10个瓶盖，你就可以做烟熏了，好吗？明白吗？}

#{701}{}{Pufff... Pufff... Want more!}
{701}{}{帕夫……帕夫……想要更多！}
#{702}{}{Yuuuck... Baad... A-choo... Man wants to poison! Away!}
{702}{}{真恶心……巴德……阿乔……男人想下毒！走开！}
#{750}{}{Shut up! This place is too good for an idiot like you... Get lost!}

#{753}{}{Man bad! I boom boom you.}
{753}{}{坏男人！我轰你。}
#{800}{}{You outsider fuck, that was your last mistake! [He takes the safety off on his rifle.]}
{800}{}{你这个外人操，那是你最后一个错误！[他把枪上的保险卸了。]}
#{801}{}{You outsider bitch, that was your last mistake! [He takes the safety off on his rifle.]}
{801}{}{你这个外人婊子，那是你最后一个错误！[他把枪上的保险卸了。]}
#{802}{}{We shall see about that.}
{802}{}{我们拭目以待。}
#{850}{}{OK. If you get some money, don't hesitate to come by. Trevor's always happy to help.}
{850}{}{好 啊。如果你有钱，尽管来吧。特雷弗总是乐于帮忙。}

{951}{}{谢谢你，亲爱的。[他把瓶盖放在口袋里。]}
#{952}{}{Will you answer now?}
{952}{}{你现在能回答吗？}
#{1000}{}{Go ahead and ask me.}
{1000}{}{去问我吧。}
#{1001}{}{What town is this?}
{1001}{}{这是哪个镇？}

#{1005}{}{Is there anything interesting here?}
{1005}{}{这里有什么有趣的事吗？}
#{1006}{}{Who are you, anyway?}
{1006}{}{你到底是谁？}
#{1007}{}{Can you survive without a smoke?}
{1007}{}{没有烟你能生存吗？}
#{1008}{}{Nothing else. If I think of something, I'll stop by.}
{1008}{}{没别的了。如果我想到什么，我会顺道来的。}
#{1009}{}{Have you ever seen this talisman before? [Describe it to him.]}
{1009}{}{你以前见过这个护身符吗？[向他描述一下]}
#{1050}{}{This pile of shit behind me was apparently named Rat Hole by someone some time ago. I can't think why.}
{1050}{}{我身后的这堆狗屎显然是前段时间有人给它起名叫“老鼠洞”。我想不出为什么。}
#{1051}{}{I want to ask you something else.}
{1051}{}{我想问你点别的。}
#{1052}{}{Thanks for your time, maybe I'll stop by later.}
{1052}{}{谢谢你的时间，也许我晚点过来。}
#{1100}{}{OK, come along whenever it suits you.}
{1100}{}{好的，你什么时候方便就来。}
#{1101}{}{[Leave.]}
{1101}{}{[离开]}
#{1150}{}{In charge? You mean like a mayor or something? Humpf. You can forget that. George, the last loser who was mayoring around here, is glad he can beg enough to survive. Now, basically only these two guys are in charge - Leonard in the north and Julian to the south.}
{1150}{}{主管？你是说像市长什么的？哼。你可以忘了。乔治，最后一个在这里当市长的失败者，很高兴他能乞求足够的钱来生存。现在，基本上只有这两个人负责――北部的伦纳德和南部的朱利安。}
#{1151}{}{Leonard and Julian? Who are they?}
{1151}{}{伦纳德和朱利安？他们是谁？}
#{1152}{}{I also want to ask you something else.}
{1152}{}{我还想问你别的问题。}
#{1153}{}{Thanks for your time, maybe I'll stop by later.}
{1153}{}{谢谢你的时间，也许我晚点过来。}
#{1200}{}{Just a couple of merchants fighting over this town. Leonard's in charge of the North Side. He mainly deals in drugs and similar shit. You better stay away from there. [He puffs on his cigarette and points south.] Julian's in charge of the South Side. If you're looking for work, you should go and see him. I'm sure he'll have something for you. Otherwise, that's the place to go if you're looking for anything to do with guns.}
{1200}{}{只是几个商人在这个镇上打架。伦纳德负责北区。他主要经营毒品和类似的东西。你最好离那远点。[他抽着烟指着南方]朱利安负责南方。如果你在找工作，你应该去看看他。我肯定他会有东西给你的。否则，如果你想找些和枪有关的东西，那就去那里。}

#{1252}{}{Thanks for your time, maybe I'll stop by later.}
{1252}{}{谢谢你的时间，也许我晚点过来。}
#{1300}{}{In one word, fucked up. Not for softies. If you trip over a dead guy, don't look surprised. I think that gives you an idea, eh? Oh don't look that way. The north also has one bar, a church and the place where that bastard Leonard lives. Like I said, you should avoid that part of town...}
{1300}{}{一句话，搞砸了。不适合软性子。如果你被一个死人绊倒了，不要显得惊讶。我想这给了你一个主意，嗯？哦，别那样看。北方也有一个酒吧，一个教堂，还有那个混蛋伦纳德住的地方。就像我说的，你应该避开那个地方……}
#{1301}{}{I see. I'd like to ask you something else.}
{1301}{}{我懂了。我想问你别的问题。}
#{1302}{}{Thanks for your time, maybe I'll stop by later.}
{1302}{}{谢谢你的时间，也许我晚点过来。}
#{1350}{}{Things are a hundred times better here. No paradise, but you can live here. Those three buildings over there, that's the boss' place. Like I told you, if you're looking for work, that's where you go. Then there's Julian's bar and even our very own hospital.}
{1350}{}{这里的情况好多了。没有天堂，但你可以住在这里。那边那三栋楼，那是老板的地方。就像我告诉你的，如果你在找工作，那就是你要去的地方。还有朱利安的酒吧，甚至我们自己的医院。}
#{1351}{}{Where can I reach Julian?}
{1351}{}{我在哪能找到朱利安？}

#{1400}{}{[He waves his hand carelessly.] I'm not interested in crap like that. I have enough troubles as it is. Like how not to be gunned down by Leonard's people. But you could try one of the old residents. If anybody ever saw this trinket of yours around here, they would know something about it.}
{1400}{}{[他漫不经心地挥挥手]我对那种废话不感兴趣。我已经够麻烦的了。比如怎么不被伦纳德的人枪杀。但你可以试试老住户。如果有人在这附近看到过你的小饰物，他们会知道的。}

{1403}{}{谢谢你给我的小费，也许我晚点过来。}
#{1450}{}{Since I came here the only unwritten rule always has been to leave Julian's people alone. You don't respect that and you'll likely only survive a few minutes. You could say that on the North Side the same thing goes for Leonard's people.}
{1450}{}{自从我来到这里，唯一不成文的规矩就是不要管朱利安的人。你不尊重这一点，你可能只能活几分钟。你可以说，在北边，伦纳德的人也一样。}
#{1451}{}{Hmm, I'll be careful. I want to ask you something else.}
{1451}{}{嗯，我会小心的。我想问你点别的。}
#{1452}{}{Thanks for your time, maybe I'll stop by later.}
{1452}{}{谢谢你的时间，也许我晚点过来。}
#{1500}{}{Lately I think the most interesting thing is where all the rats have gone. Could it be they started dying off like this town? [For a moment a shadow of thought crosses his face, but he immediately starts smiling again.] Got'ya! Rats are perhaps the only thing there's plenty of around here. Too many.}
{1500}{}{最近我觉得最有趣的是老鼠都去了哪里。会不会是他们像这个镇一样开始消亡？[有那么一会儿，他的脸上掠过一丝思想的阴影，但他马上又开始微笑了]明白了！老鼠可能是这附近唯一的动物。太多了。}
#{1501}{}{Yeah, you got me. I want to ask you something else.}
{1501}{}{是的，你抓住我了。我想问你点别的。}
#{1502}{}{Thanks for your time, maybe I'll stop by later.}

#{1553}{}{Thanks for your time, maybe I'll stop by later.}
{1553}{}{谢谢你的时间，也许我晚点过来。}
#{1600}{}{Well, a couple of years now, sure, but when I came, the town was already at war. Whatever went on before that I don't know and I'm sure I'm not interested.}
{1600}{}{好吧，几年了，当然，但我来的时候，镇上已经打仗了。不管之前发生了什么我都不知道，我肯定我不感兴趣。}

{1650}{}{什么？[他抽着烟]你是认真的吗？你不能改变上瘾。}
#{1651}{}{And where do you keep getting all these smokes from anyway?}
{1651}{}{你从哪弄来这么多烟？}
#{1652}{}{Yeah, you're right, unfortunately. I want to ask you something else.}
{1652}{}{是的，很不幸，你说得对。我想问你点别的。}
#{1653}{}{Thanks for your time, maybe I'll stop by later.}
{1653}{}{谢谢你的时间，也许我晚点过来。}
#{1700}{}{I can't tell you. [He reaches into his pocket.] Shit! My last pack and only 5 sticks! That'll last me hours at best, and I still have to stand guard for so long.}
{1700}{}{我不能告诉你。[他把手伸进口袋]妈的！我的最后一包只有5根棍子！那最多只能维持几个小时，我还得站岗这么久。}
#{1701}{}{If you'd like, I could get you some smokes. Of course it won't be for free.}
{1701}{}{如果你愿意，我可以给你弄点烟。当然不是免费的。}

{1850}{}{好吧，但你得带着他们回来，明白吗？}
#{1851}{}{Sure thing, I can do that. But first I want to know one more thing.}
{1851}{}{当然，我能做到。但首先我想知道一件事。}
#{1852}{}{I don't think I can do that. Better forget the whole deal.}
