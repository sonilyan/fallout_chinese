#{110}{}{[When he notices you, his lips curl into a grin. It seems he was waiting for you.] Oh, look who it is. What's the matter? Did I hurt your precious feelings? Does it just twist you up inside to know a lowly *black* man got the better of you? Hmph... For you, jazz is just business, a way to make a quick buck off the locals. You don't understand. *I* should be in your place. ME! Jazz was my *life!*}
{110}{}{[当他注意到你时，他的嘴唇会咧嘴笑。他好像在等你]哦，看看是谁。怎么了？我伤害了你珍贵的感情吗？是不是为了让你知道一个卑微的黑人比你强？嗯。。。对你来说，爵士乐只是一种生意，一种从当地人身上快速赚钱的方式。你不明白。*我应该在你的位置。我！爵士乐是我的生活！* -- [When he notices you, his lips curl into a grin.

{125}{}{你对什么这么感兴趣？反正你也不会明白的。你组织乐队是为了什么？名声？钱？但我们有勇气。那是新雷诺的“黄金时代”。城市是平衡的，甚至像我们这样的人也可以站在舞台上为每个人――黑人和白人――表演。 -- What are you so interested for? You wouldn't get it, anyway.
