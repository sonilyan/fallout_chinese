#{1402}{}{I have to go. See you, Kevin.}
{1402}{}{我得走了。再见，凯文。}

#{1750}{}{[He takes the offered money.] On the other hand they might not find it that big of a problem. The last private company we set up was headed to Albuquerque.

I'd go looking for him in the same place, if I were you.}

[Kevin thinks about this.] I've got a proposition for you. If you persuade Frederyk to come, I'll pay you... 150 caps, how about that? I just want to be done with it, that's all.}
{2100}{}{听着，这是例会。上次市议会开会后，还有几个问题尚未解决。这对赛迪特车队来说是一件非常重要的事情。[凯文想了想]我有个建议给你。如果你说服弗雷德里克来，我会付钱给你。。。150个，怎么样？我只想结束这一切，仅此而已。}
#{2101}{}{Fine, then. Frederyk will be there.}
{2101}{}{那好吧。弗雷德里克会去的。}
#{2102}{}{You're trying to bribe me? That didn't quite dispel my suspicions. Good bye, Kevin.}
{2102}{}{你想贿赂我？那并没有完全消除我的怀疑。再见，凯文。}
#{2150}{}{How many times do I have to explain this? It's just a regular meeting. There are a few issues that have remained open after the last meeting of the town council. It's a very important matter for Sedit Caravan. In fact, it's so important I'm willing to pay you a little extra something... 150 caps, how about that? I just want to be done with it, that's all.}
{2150}{}{我要解释多少次？只是例会而已。上次市议会开会后，还有几个问题尚未解决。这对赛迪特车队来说是一件非常重要的事情。事实上，这很重要，我愿意多给你点钱。。。150个，怎么样？我只想结束这一切，仅此而已。}
#{2151}{}{OK.}
{2151}{}{好 啊。}
#{2200}{}{I've already told you all I know. And I've even offered you extra cash. Go see Frederyk and, Jesus, stop putting it off. That meeting is a hell of an important matter to Sedit Caravan.}
{2200}{}{我已经把我知道的都告诉你了。我甚至给了你额外的现金。去见弗雷德里克，天哪，别再拖延了。那次会议对塞迪特商队来说是一件非常重要的事情。}
#{2201}{}{I'm sorry. I'll go see him right away.}
{2201}{}{我很抱歉。我马上去看他。}
#{2250}{}{You've got some nerves showing your ass around here. We don't tolerate dumping our caravans. You won't get any more jobs for Sedit Caravan.}
{2250}{}{你有点神经兮兮的。我们不能容忍丢弃我们的大篷车。你再也找不到塞迪特商队的工作了。}
#{2251}{}{OK, I understand. Bye.}
{2251}{}{好的，我明白。再见。}
#{2252}{}{Fine, I need to discuss an important matter with you, though.}
{2252}{}{好吧，不过我需要和你讨论一件重要的事情。}
#{2253}{}{Oogh.}
{2253}{}{哦。}
#{2300}{}{What do you want?}
{2300}{}{你想要什么？}
#{2301}{}{Did anyone order a private caravan with your company?}
{2301}{}{有没有人在你公司订了一辆私人大篷车？}
#{2302}{}{Frederyk's been murdered. Do you know anything about it?}
{2302}{}{弗雷德里克被谋杀了。你知道这件事吗？}
#{2303}{}{I've got a very profitable offer for Sedit Caravan.}
{2303}{}{我有一个非常有利可图的塞迪特商队报价。}
#{2304}{}{I've got a very profitable offer for Sedit Caravan.}
{2304}{}{我有一个非常有利可图的塞迪特商队报价。}
#{2305}{}{Tyler sent me. I'm here to bring a certain agreement into effect.}
{2305}{}{泰勒派我来的。我来这里是为了使某项协议生效。}
#{2306}{}{Is it possible to take care of that Tyler thing now?}
{2306}{}{现在有可能搞定泰勒那件事吗？}
#{2307}{}{I've already passed the meeting invitation to Frederyk.}
{2307}{}{我已经把会议邀请发给弗雷德里克了。}
#{2308}{}{I've already passed the meeting invitation to Frederyk.}
{2308}{}{我已经把会议邀请发给弗雷德里克了。}
#{2309}{}{Nothing, thanks. Bye.}
{2309}{}{没什么，谢谢。再见。}
#{2310}{}{Bye-bye, siree.}
{2310}{}{再见，陛下。}
#{2350}{}{All I know is they found him dead and mugged in one of the backyard alleys. Sedit's a dangerous place. Things like that happen sometimes.}
{2350}{}{我只知道他们发现他死了，在后院的一条小巷里遭到抢劫。这是个危险的地方。这样的事情有时会发生。}
#{2351}{}{Stop bullshitting me, bonehead! I'm sure you had something to do with it.}
{2351}{}{别跟我胡扯了，笨蛋！我肯定你和这事有关。}
#{2352}{}{Well, I've got to go.}
{2352}{}{我得走了。}
#{2400}{}{Fine, here's your reward. That's it. I don't have any more jobs for you.}
{2400}{}{好吧，这是你的报酬。就这样。我没有更多的工作给你了。}
#{2401}{}{In that case, good-bye, Kevin.}
{2401}{}{那样的话，再见，凯文。}
#{2402}{}{Does that mean we can take care of that Tyler thing now?}
{2402}{}{那是不是意味着我们现在可以处理泰勒的事了？}
#{2450}{}{Hi there, the name's Kevin. If you're looking for a job with the caravans, I'm the person you should talk to. I'm in charge of that here. So can I help you in any way?}
{2450}{}{你好，我叫凯文。如果你在商队找工作，我是你应该找的人。我负责这件事。我能帮你什么忙吗？}
#{2451}{}{I'd like to know what the meeting invitation for Frederyk really is about.}
{2451}{}{我想知道弗雷德里克的会议邀请到底是关于什么的。}
#{2452}{}{That's okay, thanks. Bye.}
{2452}{}{没关系，谢谢。再见。}
#{2453}{}{Bye-bye, siree.}
{2453}{}{再见，陛下。}
#{2550}{}{I don't have any jobs for you right now. Something might appear later, though. Try tomorrow.}
{2550}{}{我现在没有工作给你。不过，稍后可能会出现一些情况。明天试试。}
#{2551}{}{OK.}
{2551}{}{好 啊。}
#{2600}{}{Sorry but you'll have to wait a little longer. Come back tomorrow. I'm sure you'll be able to proceed then.}
{2600}{}{对不起，你得再等一会儿。明天再来。我相信你到时候可以继续。}
#{2601}{}{Fuck that. Let me see her or you'll be sorry!}
{2601}{}{去他妈的。让我看看她，否则你会后悔的！}
#{2602}{}{In that case, good-bye. For now.}
{2602}{}{那样的话，再见。现在。}
