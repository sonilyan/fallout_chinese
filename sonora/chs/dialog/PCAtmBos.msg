{115}{}{不，警长，他把自己锁在里面，不让任何人进去。我们必须做点什么！}

### {200}{}{Well, well. And here is the first messenger of evil. Or not? I'm getting confused about the days of the week, I need to wind up the clock.}
{200}{}{嗯，嗯。这是邪恶的第一个使者。还是不？我对一周中的几天感到困惑，我需要把时钟调快。}

### {204}{}{The pipeline from the reactor cooling system exploded. Burst like a nasty worm. We've cut off the liquid supply, but there won't be enough reserves for a long time. The reactor will overheat from month to month and sooner or later it will have to be turned off.}
{204}{}{反应堆冷却系统的管道发生爆炸。像讨厌的虫子一样爆裂。我们已经切断了液体供应，但在很长一段时间内不会有足够的储备。反应堆每月都会过热，迟早会被关闭。}
### {205}{}{Doesn't sound very good. Can it be fixed?}
{205}{}{听起来不太好。它能修好吗？}
### {206}{}{Sure. But not by our forces. This is a nuclear power plant, not a factory. We need parts and equipment, and we'll have to do a good job of finding them. Can you handle it? Our payment is timely.}
{206}{}{当然但不是我们的部队。这是一座核电站，不是工厂。我们需要零件和设备，我们必须很好地找到它们。你能应付吗？我们的付款是及时的。}
### {207}{}{I don't understand it.}

### {235}{}{Well, I had to tinker with this hardware all day.}
{235}{}{嗯，我不得不整天摆弄这个硬件。}
### {236}{}{You sing sweetly, smooth skin. It can't be that your appearance coincidentally coincided with a diversion.}
{236}{}{你唱得甜美，皮肤光滑。你的出现不可能与消遣不谋而合。}
### {237}{}{Uh, sabotage?}
{237}{}{呃，蓄意破坏？}
### {238}{}{We studied the wreckage. So what? The system was deliberately blown up with dynamite. How do you explain this, my slippery pale-skinned friend?}
{238}{}{我们研究了残骸。那又怎样？这个系统是故意用炸药炸毁的。你怎么解释呢，我这个皮肤滑滑的苍白朋友？}
### {239}{}{Uh, I have nothing to do with it. You let me in yourself and then...}

### {246}{}{E... What?}
{246}{}{E.什么？}
### {247}{}{Come here, you decrepit doll, now I'll put your brains in place.}
{247}{}{过来，你这个老娃娃，现在我要把你的脑袋放好。}

### {250}{}{I know who blew up the cooler.}
{250}{}{我知道是谁炸了冷却器。}

{256}{}{教会试图说服你签订一份无利可图的合同。拉尔夫...他认为是时候担任站长了。}
### {257}{}{Hey, security! Bring Ralph to me. And do not take your eyes off him, so that there are no discounts for him... He's crazy. Like an overripe cherry. Do you know how much work it cost to launch this station?}
{257}{}{嘿，保安！把拉尔夫带到我身边。不要把你的目光从他身上移开，这样他就没有折扣了...他疯了。就像一颗过熟的樱桃。你知道发射这个电台要花多少钱吗？}
### {258}{}{I don't care...}
{258}{}{我不在乎...}
### {259}{}{Must be pretty damn hard?}
{259}{}{一定很难吗？}
### {260}{}{Oh yeah. All worries. Ralph thinks the cultists will do better if they take command here. But as a former officer, I know that people with convictions should not be allowed to come to power. Oh, I love to write out fines for crossing in the wrong place. You feel like that... big.}
{260}{}{哦，是的。所有的担忧。拉尔夫认为，如果邪教分子在这里掌权，他们会做得更好。但作为一名前官员，我知道不应该允许有定罪的人上台。哦，我喜欢写下在错误的地方穿越的罚款单。你觉得...大的}
