#{100}{}{You see a man.}
{100}{}{你看到一个男人。}
#{200}{}{You see a prisoner standing right in front of the force field, watching you intently.}
{200}{}{你看到一个囚犯站在原力场的正前方，目不转睛地看着你。}
#{300}{}{Help!}
{300}{}{救命啊！}
#{301}{}{Come here please.}
{301}{}{请过来。}
#{302}{}{Can I talk to you?}
{302}{}{我能和你谈谈吗？}
#{303}{}{It's a miracle to see a human in here.}
{303}{}{在这里看到一个人真是奇迹。}
#{500}{}{Does it make you happy to see us suffer so much?}
{500}{}{看到我们这么痛苦你高兴吗？}
#{501}{}{I want to save you.}
{501}{}{我想救你。}
#{502}{}{I'm not even going to talk to you.}
{502}{}{我甚至不想和你说话。}
#{550}{}{Sorry, but I can hardly believe that.}
{550}{}{对不起，我简直不敢相信。}
#{551}{}{I'm not with the Rebirth. I'm not a ghoul. [Uncover your face so he alone can see it.]}
{551}{}{我不支持重生。我不是僵尸。[揭开你的脸，让他一个人看得到。]}
#{552}{}{If you don't want my help, then goodbye.}
{552}{}{如果你不需要我的帮助，那么再见。}
#{600}{}{You've gotten this far. That's great. Can you help us escape? I have a plan how to do it. Listen.}
{600}{}{你已经走了这么远。太好了。你能帮我们逃走吗？我有个计划怎么做。听。}
#{601}{}{You've gotten this far. That's great. Can you help us escape? I have a plan how to do it. Listen.}
{601}{}{你已经走了这么远。太好了。你能帮我们逃走吗？我有个计划怎么做。听。}
#{602}{}{I'm listening.}
{602}{}{我在听。}
#{650}{}{Some of us have been here very long. We watch and we listen trying to find out as much as we can. We know this floor is powered by two generators. The ghouls were forced, among other things, to modify the power supply to suit their needs. And they haven't done a good job. If you disable generator number 2, the room where they make the robes will be without power for a few minutes, along with the adjacent sections and the force field of our prison on that side.}
{650}{}{我们有些人在这里呆了很长时间。我们边看边听，尽可能多地找出答案。我们知道这层楼是由两台发电机供电的。除其他外，僵尸被迫修改电源以满足他们的需要。他们做得不好。如果你关闭2号发电机，他们制造长袍的房间会停电几分钟，还有附近的部分和那边我们监狱的力场。}
#{651}{}{What will you do then?}
{651}{}{那你怎么办？}
#{700}{}{There's only a single ghoul in this room. We can subdue her without raising an alarm. Everyone will then put on their robes and simply leave posing as ghouls. In the confusion they will certainly not check anyone very thoroughly. They have a surplus of robes, there should be enough for all of us. Like I said, for this plan to work you must shut down or destroy generator number 2. All the generators are on the sixth floor.}
{700}{}{这个房间里只有一个僵尸。我们可以在不引起恐慌的情况下制服她。然后每个人都会穿上长袍，假装成僵尸离开。在混乱中，他们肯定不会彻底检查任何人。他们有多余的长袍，应该够我们所有人穿的。就像我说的，为了使这个计划有效，你必须关闭或摧毁2号发电机。所有的发电机都在六楼。}
#{701}{}{I'll see what I can do.}
{701}{}{我看看我能做什么。}
#{750}{}{[As soon as the man finishes, another prisoner speaks up from an adjacent cell.] It's not a good idea to start fighting. There may be more of us, but we're too weak. It will be better if you disable generator number 2. The room where they make robes will then be offline for a few minutes, along with its adjacent areas including the force field of our prison on that side.}
{750}{}{[这名男子一结束，另一名囚犯就从隔壁牢房里大声说出来]开始战斗不是个好主意。我们可能更多，但我们太软弱了。如果停用2号发电机会更好。他们制作长袍的房间将在几分钟内关闭，旁边的区域包括监狱的力场。}
#{751}{}{What will you do then?}
{751}{}{那你怎么办？}
#{800}{}{You shouldn't come back here. The ghouls might get suspicious and stop our plan.}
{800}{}{你不该回来。僵尸可能会怀疑并阻止我们的计划。}
#{801}{}{You shouldn't come back here. The ghouls might get suspicious and stop our plan.}
{801}{}{你不该回来。僵尸可能会怀疑并阻止我们的计划。}
#{802}{}{What do you think about the other plan?}
{802}{}{你觉得另一个计划怎么样？}
#{803}{}{What if I just eliminate all the ghouls?}
{803}{}{如果我把所有的僵尸都消灭了呢？}
#{804}{}{OK, I'm going.}
{804}{}{好的，我要走了。}
#{850}{}{It's not a good idea. There may be more of us, but we're too weak to start fighting them. I think my plan is better. I'm convinced it will work.}
{850}{}{这不是个好主意。我们可能有更多的人，但我们太虚弱了，无法与他们战斗。我认为我的计划更好。我相信它会奏效的。}
#{851}{}{What if I just eliminate all the ghouls?}
{851}{}{如果我把所有的僵尸都消灭了呢？}
#{852}{}{I'll think about it. Be ready.}
{852}{}{我会考虑的。准备好。}
#{900}{}{You'll hardly manage that. Even if you by some miracle kill all of them in the complex, there are more on the surface. My plan is the only hope for all of us.}
