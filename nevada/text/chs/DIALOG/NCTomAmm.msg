#{100}{}{You see a gunsmith.}
{100}{}{你看到一个枪手。}
#{101}{}{You see Mr. Thompson's personal gunsmith.}
{101}{}{你看汤普森先生的私人枪械匠。}
#{102}{}{You have completed part of Mr. Luciano's assignment.}
{102}{}{你已经完成了卢西亚诺先生的部分任务。}
#{103}{}{You should know better than to be here!}
{103}{}{你应该知道不要在这里！}
#{110}{}{[He scratches at his neck as he looks at you] Who the hell are you?}
{110}{}{[他看着你抓着脖子]你到底是谁？}
#{111}{}{Mr. Thompson's newest recruit. He told me to introduce myself to everyone.}
{111}{}{汤普森先生的新兵。他让我向大家作自我介绍。}
#{112}{}{None of your business.}
{112}{}{不关你的事。}
#{113}{}{Did he? [he sounds skeptical] Alright... Recruit.}
{113}{}{是吗？[他听起来很怀疑]好吧...招聘。}
#{114}{}{You have a lot of empty cartridges on that table. Why?}
{114}{}{你的桌子上有很多空墨盒。为什么？}
#{115}{}{I repack them with fresh bullets and propellant. Boring as shit, but I don't want anyone else doing it. Pack it wrong and someone's likely to get their fingers blown off.}
{115}{}{我用新子弹和推进剂重新包装。无聊得要命，但我不想让别人这么做。如果包装不当，很可能有人的手指会被炸掉。}
#{116}{}{Why don't just use new ammo?}
{116}{}{为什么不直接用新弹药呢？}
#{117}{}{How much does Thompson pay you for this?}
{117}{}{汤普森付你多少钱？}
#{118}{}{Can you make ammunition for me?}
{118}{}{你能给我做弹药吗？}
#{119}{}{I should let you get back to it. Bye.}
{119}{}{我应该让你回去。再见。}
#{120}{}{Hey. Still making ammo here. Still gonna be making it for a long, long time.}
{120}{}{嘿。还在制造弹药。还得坚持很久。}
#{121}{}{Oh yeah, just get some fresh ammo off the ammo tree! Why didn't I think of that? [he rolls his eyes] Reno's police went through all of its ammunition in the first years after the war. Anything we've found since then has been fired off over the last ten years of civil war. It's hard enough getting a working gun anymore, let alone ammo. We buy what we can from prospectors and caravans, but we still have to make every bullet count.}
{121}{}{哦，是的，从弹药树上拿些新鲜的弹药！我怎么没想到呢？[他翻白眼]雷诺的警察在战后头几年检查了所有的弹药。从那以后我们发现的任何东西都在过去十年的内战中被销毁了。要一把能用的枪已经够难了，更不用说弹药了。我们从探矿者和商队那里买我们能买的东西，但我们仍然要让每一颗子弹都有价值。}
#{122}{}{You think this is about money?! [he gives you a sharp look] I don't know if you noticed, but shit's fucked up in this city! We're here because we're the only ones trying to fix it! Back when Reno's old mayor was around, things were different. People were safe and things *worked*. We're gonna bring that back. That's worth a lot more than *money*.}
{122}{}{你以为这是为了钱？！我不知道你有没有注意到，但这个城市的情况糟透了！我们在这里是因为只有我们在努力修复它！当雷诺的老市长在的时候，情况就不同了。人是安全的，事情是有效的。我们要把它带回来。那可比钱值钱多了。}
#{123}{}{Sure! Can't fight the good fight without bullets. Bring me the right components, and I'll press some new ammo for you here and now.}
{123}{}{当然！没有子弹打不好仗。把正确的零件给我，我马上给你压一些新弹药。}
#{124}{}{[He peers at you suspiciously] Thompson didn't say you'd be coming by, so I don't have anything for you. These components aren't easy to come by. If you want me to make ammo for you, you'll need to bring the supplies yourself.}
{124}{}{[他怀疑地看着你]汤普森没说你会来，所以我没有任何东西给你。这些组件不容易找到。如果你想让我给你做弹药，你得自己带上补给。}
#{125}{}{I have powder, casings, and metal. What can you make with these?}
{125}{}{我有火药，弹壳和金属。你能用这些做什么？}
#{126}{}{I can pack 24 rounds of 10mm, or 20 rounds of .30 at a time.}
{126}{}{我可以装24发10毫米的子弹，或者一次装20发0.30毫米的子弹。}
#{127}{}{ I think you've got enough here for that.}
{127}{}{我想你已经够了。}
#{128}{}{ But I don't think you've got enough components for that.}
{128}{}{但我认为你没有足够的组件。}
#{129}{}{ I'll just need 100 bucks for operating expenses.}
{129}{}{我只需要100块做手术费。}
#{130}{}{What caliber you want?}
{130}{}{你想要什么口径？}
#{134}{}{Done!}
{134}{}{完成！}
#{135}{}{I need more ammo.}
{135}{}{我需要更多的弹药。}
#{136}{}{Thank you, that's enough.}
{136}{}{谢谢，够了。}
#{137}{}{I'll be back when I need more.}
{137}{}{我需要更多的时候就回来。}
#{140}{}{[Caliber 10 mm: 24 Rounds remains]}
{140}{}{[口径10毫米：还剩24发]}
#{141}{}{[Caliber .30: 20 Rounds remains]}
{141}{}{[口径30:20发]}
#{142}{}{}
{142}{}{}
#{143}{}{[Caliber 9mm: 20 Rounds remains]}
{143}{}{[口径9毫米：还剩20发]}
#{144}{}{[Caliber 0.45: 20 Rounds remains ]}
{144}{}{[口径0.45:还剩20发]}
#{145}{}{[Caliber 10 mm: $100 and 24 Rounds remains]}
{145}{}{[口径10毫米：$100，剩余24发]}
#{146}{}{[Caliber .30: $100 and 20 Rounds remains]}
{146}{}{[口径30:$100，还剩20发]}
#{147}{}{}
{147}{}{}
#{148}{}{[Caliber 9 mm: $100 and 20 Rounds remains]}
{148}{}{[口径9毫米：还剩100发和20发]}
#{149}{}{[Caliber 0.45: $100 and 20 Rounds remains]}
{149}{}{[口径0.45:$100，还剩20发]}
#{150}{}{Why only those calibers?}
{150}{}{为什么只有那些口径？}
#{151}{}{That's all I have the equipment for. Those are the most common calibers we have around here, so that's what we developed our tools for.}
{151}{}{我只有这些设备。这些是我们这里最常见的口径，所以这就是我们开发工具的目的。}
#{152}{}{What about 9mm or .45? They're pretty similar to what you're making now.}
{152}{}{9毫米或0.45毫米怎么样？它们和你现在做的很像。}
#{153}{}{Let's back up a bit...}
{153}{}{让我们后退一点...}
#{154}{}{You seriously can't make anything but that? Just what kind of munitions expert are you?}
{154}{}{你真的除了这个什么都做不了？你是什么样的军火专家？}
#{155}{}{Look, I'm not here to explain this to you, alright? Just trust me, that's all we're equipped to make here. Take 'em or leave 'em.}
{155}{}{听着，我不是来给你解释的，好吗？相信我，这就是我们能做的。要么带走，要么离开。}
#{156}{}{[He scratched his chin] Eh...I'll have to jury-rig the tools a bit, but I can manage that. Okay, I can whip up some 9mm and .45 for you.}
{156}{}{[他搔了搔下巴]呃……我得给工具装点东西，但我能搞定。好吧，我可以给你弄点9毫米和0.45毫米的。}
#{157}{}{That wasn't necessary. Give me a moment and I'll explain how to make 9mm and .45 rounds.}
{157}{}{那没必要。给我一点时间，我来解释如何打9毫米和0.45发子弹。}
#{158}{}{Too bad. I have another question.}
{158}{}{太糟糕了。我还有一个问题。}
#{159}{}{[He listens attentively] Hmm. Well, that's good and all, but I don't have time to run around the city looking for the necessary parts.}
{159}{}{[他聚精会神地听着]嗯，那很好，但我没有时间在城里到处跑，找必要的地方。}
#{160}{}{Fine. I'll bring you the supplies and you can pick and choose what you need.}
{160}{}{好的。我会给你带些补给品，你可以挑选你需要的东西。}
#{161}{}{Alright, deal.}
{161}{}{好吧，成交。}
#{162}{}{In fact, I have some supplies right here. Take a look.}
{162}{}{事实上，我这里有一些补给品。看一看。}
#{163}{}{I'll be back soon.}
{163}{}{我很快就回来。}
#{164}{}{I've got some scrap metal for you. Come on, take a look.}
{164}{}{我有一些废金属给你。来，看看。}
#{165}{}{[He digs through the scrap, picks some bits out and nods] Hey, you were right! This was a good idea! Maybe when this is all over, I can expand to even more calibers. Look, I owe you. Next time you come by, I'll make your ammo for free.}
{165}{}{[他在垃圾堆里翻来翻去，挑出一些碎片，点了点头]嘿，你说得对！这是个好主意！也许当这一切结束，我可以扩大到更多口径。听着，我欠你的。下次你来的时候，我会免费为你准备弹药。}
#{166}{}{Thanks. I'll keep that in mind.}
{166}{}{谢谢。我会记住的。}
#{167}{}{This gunsmith can now create a wider variety of ammunition, including 9mm and 0.45 rounds.}
{167}{}{这个枪手现在可以制造更多种类的弹药，包括9毫米和0.45发子弹。}
#{180}{}{I noticed Thompson's carrying an unusual weapon. Do you know anything about it?}
{180}{}{我注意到汤普森带着一件不寻常的武器。你知道这件事吗？}
#{181}{}{Oh, that. Yeah, energy weapons aren't common around here. I can tell you a bit about it, if you're interested.}
{181}{}{哦，那个。是的，能量武器在这里并不常见。如果你感兴趣的话，我可以告诉你一些。}
#{182}{}{Where did he get it?}
{182}{}{他从哪儿弄来的？}
#{183}{}{What does it shoot?}
{183}{}{它射什么？}
#{184}{}{How effective is it?}
{184}{}{效果如何？}
#{185}{}{Is this pre-war tech?}
{185}{}{这是战前的技术吗？}
#{186}{}{Tell me again about Thompson's gun.}
{186}{}{再跟我说说汤普森的枪。}
#{187}{}{He got it about three years ago, when he found out his old gunsmith - the one before me - was dealing on both sides of the table. He ordered the guys to teach him a lesson, but the fucker was tough - he made his last stand in his house and they had to ventilate him. Only the gun remained.}
{187}{}{大约三年前，当他发现他的老枪手――在我之前的那个――在桌子两边做交易时，他得到了这个消息。他命令那些家伙教训他一顿，但那混蛋很强硬――他在家里做了最后一站，他们不得不给他通风。只剩下枪了。}
#{188}{}{Plasma bolt. It's complicated. Just know that it melts through flesh and bone like... Uh, well, nothing else comes close, really.}
{188}{}{等离子螺栓。这很复杂。只知道它会像…一样从骨肉中融化...呃，好吧，没什么比这更接近的了，真的。}
#{189}{}{Very. It hits like a high-caliber round and it'll go through anything you'll find around here, though some pre-war armor was built to stop it. I've heard it's not the best when it comes to energy weapons, though, but it's not like I'd know for myself.}
{189}{}{非常好。它击中像一个高口径的子弹，它会通过任何你会发现在这里，虽然一些战前装甲是用来阻止它。我听说这不是最好的当谈到能源武器，虽然，但它不像我自己知道。}
#{190}{}{Yes and no. The gunsmith grafted parts from a plasma pistol to the frame of a Tommy gun. I think he hoped to add more parts to increase the power supply, or at least make it more accurate. But as it is, it works pretty much like any other Glock-86.}
{190}{}{是的，也不是。枪手把等离子手枪的零件移植到了汤米枪的枪架上。我认为他希望增加更多的部件来增加电力供应，或者至少使其更加精确。但实际上，它的工作原理和其他格洛克-86差不多。}
#{191}{}{Glock?}
{191}{}{格洛克？}
#{192}{}{Yeah, that's the company that made the plasma pistol. Designed by a computer that thinks like a man, or maybe a man that put his brain in a computer, or something. I don't know, I wasn't there.}
{192}{}{是的，那是制造等离子手枪的公司。由一台像人一样思考的电脑设计的，或者一个把大脑放在电脑里的人，或者别的什么。我不知道，我不在那里。}
#{193}{}{That's enough about guns for now. Let's chat about it later.}
{193}{}{关于枪，现在已经够了。我们以后再谈吧。}
#{1110}{}{[He scratches at his neck as he looks at you] Who the hell are you?}
{1110}{}{[他看着你抓着脖子]你到底是谁？}
#{1111}{}{Mr. Thompson's newest recruit. He told me to introduce myself to everyone.}
{1111}{}{汤普森先生的新兵。他让我向大家作自我介绍。}
