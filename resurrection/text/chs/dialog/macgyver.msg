#{100}{}{You see a man.}
{100}{}{你看到一个男人。}
#{150}{}{You see MacGyver.}
{150}{}{你看到麦基弗了。}
#{200}{}{You see a man. He looks like he can get out of any difficulty.}
{200}{}{你看到一个男人。他看起来能摆脱任何困难。}
#{250}{}{You see MacGyver. A man who can build even a space shuttle just by using his pocket knife and the equipment found in any workshop in the world.}
{250}{}{你看到麦基弗了。他甚至可以用他的小刀和世界上任何一个车间里的设备制造出一架航天飞机。}
#{251}{}{You see MacGyver. Just by using a shoe and some Nuka-Cola he can build a battery.}
{251}{}{你看到麦基弗了。只要用一只鞋和一些努卡可乐，他就能制造出一个电池。}
#{252}{}{You see MacGyver. He can build a computer using, let's say, a toothbrush and some chewing gum.}
{252}{}{你看到麦基弗了。他可以用牙刷和口香糖做一台电脑。}
#{300}{}{I don't have anything, I never take anything with me. You can always use whatever you find.}
{300}{}{我什么都没有，我从不带任何东西。你找到什么就用什么。}
#{500}{}{Hello. If you came to play hockey, you'll have to wait a little bit, until I finish the stadium.}
{500}{}{你好。如果你来打曲棍球，你得等一等，直到我把球场打完。}
#{501}{}{What? Who are you?}
{501}{}{什么？你是谁？}
#{502}{}{Haven't we already met?}
{502}{}{我们还没见过面吗？}
#{550}{}{Sorry, I haven't introduced myself. My name is MacGyver. As you can see, I'm building a rink for ice hockey here. Great game, don't you think?}
{550}{}{对不起，我还没有自我介绍。我叫麦基弗。如你所见，我正在这里建一个冰球场。很棒的比赛，你不觉得吗？}
#{551}{}{Tell me about hockey.}
{551}{}{跟我说说曲棍球。}
#{552}{}{Who are you, actually?}
{552}{}{你到底是谁？}
#{600}{}{You don't know hockey? It's played by two teams, there are always 5 players plus one goalie on the ice and their objective is to get the puck into the opposite team's net using their hockey sticks. The team which scores more of those goals, wins.}
{600}{}{你不懂曲棍球？冰球是由两支球队进行的，冰球上总有5名球员和一名守门员，他们的目标是用冰球棒将冰球打入对方球网。进球越多的球队获胜。}
#{601}{}{The whole rink is made out of ice? You mean frozen water? Water that is in dangerously short supply everywhere?}
{601}{}{整个溜冰场都是冰做的？你是说冷冻水？到处都是严重短缺的水？}
#{650}{}{Yes. The water is not a problem, it requires a bit of a skill to make it in makeshift conditions, but if you have a piece of paper, half of your work is already done. I actually have bigger concern about a cooling device to keep the ice from melting.}
{650}{}{对。水不是问题，它需要一点技巧才能在临时条件下制造出来，但是如果你有一张纸，你的一半工作已经完成了。实际上，我更关心的是一个冷却装置来防止冰融化。}
#{651}{}{What's wrong with it?}
{651}{}{怎么了？}
#{700}{}{I'm building it using various things, whatever I can find, but I'm missing a couple of components and I'm all out of bubblegum. Without it, it will require more time now, given that you can use bubblegum for almost anything, not to mention the wrapping. Replacing it won't be easy.}
{700}{}{我正在用各种各样的东西来构建它，不管我能找到什么，但是我缺少一些组件，而且我已经没有泡泡糖了。如果没有它，现在就需要更多的时间，因为你几乎可以用泡泡糖做任何事情，更不用说包装了。更换它并不容易。}
#{701}{}{All right then, you have ice, but what do you use to build the rest?}
{701}{}{好吧，你有冰，但是你用什么来建造剩下的？}
#{750}{}{Anything that's lying around. A little bit of wood here, a little bit of sand there, fasten it with a hairpin or a shoelace and you got yourself an ice hockey stadium.}
{750}{}{到处都是。这里有一点木头，那里有一点沙子，用发夹或鞋带固定，你就有了一个冰球场。}
#{751}{}{And what about players? Well now, you cannot make those.}
{751}{}{球员呢？现在，你不能做那些。}
#{800}{}{Once I'm finished, I believe the people will come and they will be happy to play. Everybody likes hockey. Eventually we will create a whole league, so people would finally stop attacking and killing one another. Instead of hurting each other, they will play hockey together.}
{800}{}{一旦我完成比赛，我相信人们会来的，他们会很高兴比赛的。每个人都喜欢曲棍球。最终我们会建立一个完整的联盟，这样人们就不会再互相攻击和杀戮了。他们不会互相伤害，而是一起打曲棍球。}
#{801}{}{I think that you're a fool if you believe that.}
{801}{}{如果你相信的话，我认为你是个傻瓜。}
#{802}{}{That sound great. I'd like to play as well.}
{802}{}{听起来不错。我也想玩。}
#{803}{}{That sound great. I'd like to play as well.}
{803}{}{听起来不错。我也想玩。}
#{850}{}{It's beneficial to be an optimist. You'll see that sport draws people together.}
{850}{}{做一个乐观主义者是有益的。你会看到这项运动把人们聚在一起。}
#{851}{}{Who exactly are you?}
{851}{}{你到底是谁？}
#{852}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{852}{}{我能问你点别的吗？}
#{853}{}{I'll better go, there is no point in arguing with a lunatic.}
{853}{}{我还是走吧，跟疯子争论是没有意义的。}
#{900}{}{Great, I'll count you in. Meanwhile, during your travels, practice shooting on goal. You don't have any equipment, but it's enough to make a goal out of two rocks, to make a stick out of some branch and to make puck out of, let's say... Well, whatever you could find, you will come up with something.}
{900}{}{太好了，我把你也算进去。同时，在旅途中，练习射门。你没有任何装备，但是用两块石头做一个球门，用树枝做一根棍子，用冰球就足够了，比方说。。。不管你能找到什么，你都会想出办法的。}
#{901}{}{Who exactly are you?}
{901}{}{你到底是谁？}
#{902}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{902}{}{我能问你点别的吗？}
#{903}{}{Okay, I'll start practicing right away. Take care.}
{903}{}{好的，我马上开始练习。当心。}
#{950}{}{I don't think so. I'm MacGyver. As you can see, I'm building a stadium for ice hockey here. Great game, don't you think?}
{950}{}{我不这么认为。我是麦基弗。如你所见，我正在这里建一个冰球运动场。很棒的比赛，你不觉得吗？}
#{951}{}{Tell me about hockey.}
{951}{}{跟我说说曲棍球。}
#{952}{}{Who exactly are you?}
{952}{}{你到底是谁？}
#{1000}{}{I'm just a man that helps wherever the help is needed. Besides rescuing people out of trouble I mostly engaged in protecting the environment and I was pretty successful in it. I was able to prevent the continuous destruction of nature. It's a shame that the nuclear war turned all my efforts to ashes. But after some ice hockey matches, I'll start anew.}
{1000}{}{我只是一个需要帮助的人。除了把人们从困境中解救出来之外，我主要从事环境保护工作，我在这方面非常成功。我能够阻止大自然的不断破坏。核战争使我的努力化为乌有，真是可惜。但在一些冰球比赛之后，我会重新开始。}
#{1001}{}{You lived in the times before the war? How is it possible?}
{1001}{}{你生活在战前的时代？怎么可能？}
#{1002}{}{Oh crap, you're a pacifist and an environmental activist.}
{1002}{}{糟糕，你是个和平主义者和环保主义者。}
#{1003}{}{I carry a lot of junk with me. I was just wondering, could you craft something useful out of it for me?}
{1003}{}{我随身带了很多垃圾。我只是在想，你能为我做点有用的东西吗？}
#{1004}{}{Tell me about hockey.}
{1004}{}{跟我说说曲棍球。}
#{1005}{}{I won't distract you any longer, you've got a lot of work ahead of you.}
{1005}{}{我不会再分散你的注意力了，你还有很多工作要做。}
#{1050}{}{When I heard that warheads were fired, I wanted to stop it. A crafty switch of some wires in any control center would do the trick, but when I was heading there, looting and violence broke out. So I was helping in any way I could. I was preventing looting, restraining thugs, directing people to vaults and so on. Ultimately I only had time to build a little shelter with cryostasis for myself. It stopped working just recently due to the shortage of energy. The bottle of Nuka-Cola can't produce electricity forever, so I woke up.}
{1050}{}{当我听说有人发射核弹头时，我想阻止它。在任何一个控制中心，巧妙地切换一些电线都可以达到目的，但当我前往那里时，抢劫和暴力事件爆发了。所以我尽力帮忙。我在阻止抢劫，约束暴徒，指挥人们去地下室等等。最终我只有时间为自己建造一个带有冷冻的小庇护所。由于能源短缺，它最近才停止工作。那瓶努卡可乐不能永远发电，所以我醒了。}
#{1051}{}{Since you've got skills like that, shouldn't you be crafting something more important?}
{1051}{}{既然你有这样的技能，难道你不应该做一些更重要的事情吗？}
#{1100}{}{In this moment, there is nothing more important than a hockey stadium. It will help everybody. What else should I be crafting? Guns? Guns are evil, remember that. But when I finish the stadium, hopefully people will switch guns for hockey sticks.}
{1100}{}{在这一刻，没有什么比曲棍球馆更重要了。这对每个人都有帮助。我还应该做些什么？枪？枪是邪恶的，记住这一点。但当我看完体育场，希望人们会把枪换成曲棍球棍。}
#{1101}{}{I need guns for my own protection.}
{1101}{}{我需要枪来保护自己。}
#{1150}{}{If there were no guns among the people, then you wouldn't need them either. And even in the case of a gun-related threat there is always a way to save yourself, you just need to look around you. There are a lot of things you can use to stun your opponent, or even better, to avoid him.}
{1150}{}{如果人民中没有枪，那么你也不会需要它们。即使遇到与枪支有关的威胁，也总有办法拯救自己，你只需要环顾四周。有很多东西你可以用来击昏你的对手，甚至更好，以避免他。}
#{1151}{}{Oh crap, you're a pacifist and an environmental activist.}
{1151}{}{糟糕，你是个和平主义者和环保主义者。}
#{1152}{}{Could you craft something useful out of the junk I carry with me?}
{1152}{}{你能用我随身携带的垃圾做些有用的东西吗？}
#{1153}{}{Tell me about hockey.}
{1153}{}{跟我说说曲棍球。}
#{1154}{}{I would rather avoid talking to you, goodbye.}
{1154}{}{我宁愿不和你说话，再见。}
#{1200}{}{Yes, that is the only right philosophy in life. One day, we will all live in peace, there will be peace between people, between people and animals, and between animals of all kinds as well. All the carnivorous animals can eat tofu instead of meat, just like people should.}
{1200}{}{是的，这是人生唯一正确的哲学。总有一天，我们都会生活在和平中，人与人之间，人与动物之间，以及各种动物之间都会有和平。所有的食肉动物都可以吃豆腐而不是肉，就像人们应该吃的那样。}
#{1201}{}{Enough, I can't take this any more, you have to die.}
{1201}{}{够了，我受不了了，你得死。}
#{1202}{}{You're absolutely right, I can't wait for these great times to come.}
{1202}{}{你说得太对了，我等不及了。}
#{1203}{}{I don't have time for this, I'll leave you here with your dreams. Goodbye.}
{1203}{}{我没有时间，我会把你留在这里，带着你的梦想。再见。}
#{1250}{}{I'm glad that there are still people like you in this world.}
{1250}{}{我很高兴这个世界上还有像你这样的人。}
#{1251}{}{Tell me, how is it possible that you lived before the war?}
{1251}{}{告诉我，你怎么可能生活在战前？}
#{1252}{}{I carry a lot of junk with me. I was just wondering, could you craft something useful out of it for me?}
{1252}{}{我随身带了很多垃圾。我只是在想，你能为我做点有用的东西吗？}
#{1253}{}{Tell me about hockey.}
{1253}{}{跟我说说曲棍球。}
#{1254}{}{Thanks, it's my pleasure. I will go now. I have to continue to spread peace in the world.}
{1254}{}{谢谢，这是我的荣幸。我现在就去。我必须继续在世界上传播和平。}
#{1300}{}{I'm glad that there are still people like you in this world. You know what? Give me all the weapons you have, and I'll make sure that they won't hurt anybody anymore. I will even craft something useful out of them: I'll use their material to build the stadium.}
{1300}{}{我很高兴这个世界上还有像你这样的人。你知道吗？把你所有的武器都给我，我保证他们不会再伤害任何人了。我甚至会从他们身上制造一些有用的东西：我会用他们的材料来建造体育场。}
#{1301}{}{Sure, here you go.}
{1301}{}{当然，给你。}
#{1302}{}{I'll rather keep them... I will make bird feeders with them... Probably vulture feeders.}
{1302}{}{我宁愿留着它们。。。我要用它们做鸟食器。。。可能是秃鹫喂食者。}
#{1350}{}{Thank you, we are one step closer to the world peace.}
{1350}{}{谢谢，我们离世界和平又近了一步。}
#{1351}{}{Tell me, how is it possible that you lived before the war?}
{1351}{}{告诉我，你怎么可能生活在战前？}
#{1352}{}{I carry a lot of junk with me. I was just wondering, could you craft something useful out of it for me?}
{1352}{}{我随身带了很多垃圾。我只是在想，你能为我做点有用的东西吗？}
#{1353}{}{Tell me about hockey.}
{1353}{}{跟我说说曲棍球。}
#{1354}{}{Exactly, my brother. I'm going to spread the idea of a gun-free world now.}
{1354}{}{没错，我哥哥。我现在要传播无枪世界的理念。}
#{1400}{}{Good idea.}
{1400}{}{好主意。}
#{1401}{}{Tell me, how is it possible that you lived before the war?}
{1401}{}{告诉我，你怎么可能生活在战前？}
#{1402}{}{I carry a lot of junk with me. I was just wondering, could you craft something useful out of it for me?}

#{1403}{}{Tell me about hockey.}
{1403}{}{跟我说说曲棍球。}
#{1404}{}{I will go now. I have to spread peace in the world.}
{1404}{}{我现在就去。我必须在世界上传播和平。}
#{1450}{}{I could, but I don't want to hinder the building of the stadium much longer, so I'll craft you each thing only once. Don't worry, I'll show you how to do it, so later you will be able to do it as well. And unfortunately I lost my multifunctional Swiss pocket knife. With it you can craft anything out of anything. Without it, the possibilities are quite limited.}
{1450}{}{我可以，但我不想再妨碍体育场的建设了，所以每件事我只给你安排一次。别担心，我会教你怎么做的，以后你也能做。不幸的是，我的多功能瑞士小刀丢了。有了它，你可以用任何东西做任何东西。没有它，可能性是相当有限的。}
#{1451}{}{OK, take a look in my bag, see if you can craft anything.}
{1451}{}{好的，看看我的包，看看你能不能做点什么。}
#{1500}{}{I can't do it without my pocket knife. Just a few things that I could use to build the stadium, but I won't take them from you, you sure need them.}
{1500}{}{没有我的小刀我做不到。只是一些我可以用来建造体育场的东西，但我不会从你那里拿走，你肯定需要它们。}
#{1501}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{1501}{}{我能问你点别的吗？}
#{1502}{}{Thanks anyway. Bye.}
{1502}{}{无论如何谢谢你。再见。}
#{1550}{}{Well, there are some things we can use here, you just have to do this, look... [He takes a radscorpion tail and a lighter. He does some strange, even nasty things with them, and after a couple of seconds he gives you a new product.] And so you get an ultra stimpak. Now you can craft it too, am I right? [You've absolutely no idea how he did it.]}

Now you surely won't have any problem crafting it, will you? [You've absolutely no idea how he did it.]}
{1650}{}{嗯，这里有些东西我们可以用，你只要做这个，听着。。。[他拿了一盒面条和一个馅饼。他用它们做了一些奇怪的，甚至是讨厌的事情，几秒钟后他给了你一个新产品。现在你一定不会有任何问题，对吗？[你完全不知道他是怎么做到的。]}

#{2051}{}{It looks more like some strange energy weapon.}
{2051}{}{它看起来更像是某种奇怪的能量武器。}
#{2100}{}{It surely doesn't; it has to have some other use. Guns are bad, I would never craft one. You'll surely come up with some better use, I believe you.}

{2303}{}{我随身带了很多垃圾。我只是在想，你能为我做点有用的东西吗？}
#{2304}{}{Please, take a look and see if you can craft something out of things I carry with me.}
{2304}{}{请看一下，看看你能不能用我随身携带的东西做点什么。}
#{2305}{}{Tell me about hockey.}
{2305}{}{跟我说说曲棍球。}
#{2306}{}{Who exactly are you?}
{2306}{}{你到底是谁？}
#{2307}{}{So, I won't keep you from work, take care.}
{2307}{}{所以，我不会阻止你工作的，保重。}
#{2350}{}{Hi. It is pretty obvious that you suffer from some kind of mental disability. But don't worry, neither I nor anyone else will think any less about you because of that.}
{2350}{}{你好。很明显你患有某种精神残疾。但别担心，我和其他人都不会因此而少想你。}
#{2351}{}{He?}
{2351}{}{他？}
#{2400}{}{My name is MacGyver. I'm building a hockey stadium here. Don't worry, you will play too, once I'm finished. Nobody will treat you badly or bully you because of your disability. Actually, I would be happy to have you on my team.}
{2400}{}{我叫麦基弗。我在这里建一个曲棍球馆。别担心，我一结束你也会玩的。没有人会因为你的残疾而虐待你或欺负你。事实上，我很高兴你能加入我的团队。}
#{2401}{}{Hoh-key?}
{2401}{}{霍基？}
#{2450}{}{You don't know hockey? It is played by two teams. There are always five players and one goalie on the ice playing for each team and their task is to get a puck inside the opponent's goal, using their sticks. Whoever can score more goals, wins. It's a great game, you will like it.}
{2450}{}{你不懂曲棍球？它由两个队比赛。每队都有五名队员和一名守门员在冰上比赛，他们的任务是用球棒在对方球门内打出一个冰球。谁能进更多的球，谁就赢。这是一场伟大的比赛，你会喜欢的。}
#{2451}{}{I is?}
{2451}{}{我是谁？}
#{2500}{}{Ice is frozen water. As soon as I finish the stadium, which won't be a problem, because there is never a shortage of hairpins and shoelaces to hold things together, I will provide ice too. If you have a piece of paper, the creation of water is already half done and there are only a couple of components left to finish a cooling device. Don't you have some chewing gum, by any chance? Never mind, I'll do it another way.}
{2500}{}{冰是冷冻水。一旦我完成了体育场，这不会是一个问题，因为从来没有发夹和鞋带短缺举行的东西在一起，我会提供冰了。如果你有一张纸，水的创造已经完成了一半，并且只剩下几个组件来完成一个冷却装置。你没有口香糖吗？没关系，我换一种方式。}
#{2501}{}{Ugh.}
{2501}{}{啊。}
#{2550}{}{When it's done, I'm sure a lot of people will come here to play. And as I already said, I'm counting on you for my new team. For now, practice shooting on goal. You don't have any equipment, but it's enough to make a goal out of two rocks, to make a stick out of some branch and to make puck out of, let's say... Well, whatever you could find, you will come up with something.}
{2550}{}{完成后，我相信会有很多人来这里玩。我已经说过了，我的新团队就指望你了。现在，练习射门。你没有任何装备，但是用两块石头做一个球门，用树枝做一根棍子，用冰球就足够了，比方说。。。不管你能找到什么，你都会想出办法的。}
#{2551}{}{Hegh?}
{2551}{}{嘿？}
#{2600}{}{I'm looking forward to it. Goodbye, for now.}
{2600}{}{我很期待。再见，现在。}
#{2601}{}{Eheh.}
{2601}{}{呃。}
#{2650}{}{Hi, so how is the training going?}
{2650}{}{嗨，训练怎么样了？}
#{2651}{}{Burp.}
{2651}{}{打嗝。}
#{2700}{}{I believe it's going well. Keep up the good work.}
{2700}{}{我相信进展顺利。继续努力。}
#{2701}{}{Ugh.}
{2701}{}{啊。}
#{2750}{}{Hi, is it just me or did you change somehow?}
{2750}{}{嗨，是我还是你变了？}
#{2751}{}{I feel better than I did the last time.}
{2751}{}{我感觉比上次好多了。}
#{2800}{}{Sports will make you healthy, it's an obvious truth. I can see it's already working, even if you only started to train just recently.}
{2800}{}{运动会使你健康，这是显而易见的事实。我可以看到它已经开始工作了，即使你最近才开始训练。}
#{2801}{}{If you think so. Can you tell me, who exactly are you?}
{2801}{}{如果你这么认为的话。你能告诉我，你到底是谁吗？}
#{2802}{}{If you think so. I want to ask you something.}
{2802}{}{如果你这么认为的话。我想问你一件事。}
#{2803}{}{I don't want to disappoint you, so I'd better leave.}
{2803}{}{我不想让你失望，所以我最好离开。}
#{2850}{}{Hello. If you came to play hockey, you'll have to wait a little bit, until I finish the stadium.}
{2850}{}{你好。如果你来打曲棍球，你得等一等，直到我把球场打完。}
#{2851}{}{What? Who are you?}
{2851}{}{什么？你是谁？}
#{2852}{}{Haven't we already met?}
{2852}{}{我们还没见过面吗？}
#{2900}{}{If there were no guns among the people, then you wouldn't need them either. And even in the case of a gun-related threat there is always a way to save yourself, you just need to look around you. There are a lot of things you can use to stun your opponent, or even better, to avoid him.}
{2900}{}{如果人民中没有枪，那么你也不会需要它们。即使遇到与枪支有关的威胁，也总有办法拯救自己，你只需要环顾四周。有很多东西你可以用来击昏你的对手，甚至更好，以避免他。}
#{2901}{}{Oh crap, you're a pacifist and an environmental activist.}
{2901}{}{糟糕，你是个和平主义者和环保主义者。}
#{2902}{}{Could you craft something useful out of the junk I carry with me?}
{2902}{}{你能用我随身携带的垃圾做些有用的东西吗？}
#{2903}{}{Tell me about hockey.}
{2903}{}{跟我说说曲棍球。}
#{2904}{}{I'd rather avoid talking to you, goodbye.}
{2904}{}{我宁愿不和你说话，再见。}
#{2950}{}{Hi. It is pretty obvious that you suffer from some kind of mental disability. But don't worry, neither I nor anyone else will think any less about you because of that.}
{2950}{}{你好。很明显你患有某种精神残疾。但别担心，我和其他人都不会因此而少想你。}
#{2951}{}{Heh?}
{2951}{}{嘿？}
#{3000}{}{Hi, Is it just me or did you change somehow?}
{3000}{}{嗨，是我还是你变了？}
#{3001}{}{I feel better than I did the last time.}
