#{100}{}{You see: a colonel.}
{100}{}{你看：上校。}
#{101}{}{You see: a commander of the assault team. He's here not for a party.}
{101}{}{你看：突击队的指挥官。他不是来参加聚会的。}
#{110}{}{Stop, you scum! So, here's the person that did all of this? Just in time. It??s a shame that we had to chase you all over the state.}
{110}{}{住手，你这个人渣！所以，这就是做这一切的人？来得正是时候。很遗憾我们不得不在全州追捕你。}
#{111}{}{Me? You must be mistaken. Who are you people?}
{111}{}{我？你一定弄错了。你们是谁？}
#{112}{}{*I* will ask question here! I am colonel Knight. Now I??m in charge. Your action in the wastes caused quite a fuss, we??ll have to do a lot of work to fix everything.}
{112}{}{*我要在这里提问！我是奈特上校。现在由我负责。你在垃圾场的行为引起了很大的骚动，我们要做大量的工作来修复一切。}
#{113}{}{Colonel... How uncommon these days.}
{113}{}{上校...这年头真不寻常。}
#{114}{}{[Contemptuously] You monkey... How such a pitiful thing like you could make so much trouble? You weren??t created for this. Ha, even back at the base everyone believes, that their "health insurance" does not have any ability to realize their existence, not to mention talk and think for themselves.}
{114}{}{[轻蔑地]你这个猴子...像你这样可怜的家伙怎么会惹这么多麻烦？你不是为这个而生的。哈，即使回到基地大家都相信，他们的“医保”也没有任何能力实现自己的存在，更不用说自说自话、自省了。}
#{115}{}{"Health insurance"? Is this how you people call us?}
{115}{}{“健康保险”？你们是这样称呼我们的吗？}
#{116}{}{Yes, we do, and this is what you are. Still have troubles believing it? How unfortunate. I started to hope that you??ll say something meaningful, but your brain is too small for this.}
{116}{}{是的，我们有，这就是你。你还不相信吗？真不幸。我开始希望你说些有意义的话，但是你的脑子太小了。}
#{117}{}{[Next]}
{117}{}{[下一步]}
#{118}{}{Now let??s get down to business. We know that Bayham wanted to get his hands on the ACS component, but he was interrupted. And you are on the list of suspects. At one hand, I??m grateful. It would be difficult for us to deal with that son of a bitch. He thought a hell of too much of himself. If he would seize control of the cloning facility, then Nevada would become his empire.}
{118}{}{现在让我们开始谈正事。我们知道拜厄姆想得到他的手上的ACS组件，但他被打断了。你在嫌疑犯名单上。一方面，我很感激。我们很难对付那个狗娘养的。他把自己想得太多了。如果他夺取克隆工厂的控制权，那么内华达州将成为他的帝国。}
#{119}{}{[Next]}
{119}{}{[下一步]}
#{120}{}{But now he's out of the picture, you??re here and you can return the component where it belongs. Bring it to me. You don??t have any choice anyway.}
{120}{}{但现在他不在这张照片里了，你在这里，你可以把部件放回原处。把它带给我。你别无选择。}
#{121}{}{There's always a choice. I can destroy the device and the whole base with it and stop the cloning process forever.}
{121}{}{总有选择的余地。我可以用它摧毁设备和整个基地，永远停止克隆过程。}
#{122}{}{I would anyway, but what are you going to do?}
{122}{}{无论如何，我会的，但你打算怎么办？}
#{123}{}{Destroy? Ha! Your brain is not suited to handle such a complicated task. The device that you're hiding is basically a disc, structurally based on refractory crystals. Do you even UNDERSTAND what REFRACTORY means? In order to destroy it, you need temperature you can get only in a lab with proper equipment. So, just hand it to me - and everything will be over.}
{123}{}{毁灭？哈！你的大脑不适合处理这么复杂的任务。你藏起来的装置基本上是一个圆盘，结构上是基于难熔晶体。你知道耐火材料是什么意思吗？为了破坏它，你需要的温度只有在实验室里用合适的设备才能得到。所以，把它交给我-一切都会过去的。}
#{124}{}{Every other subject like you have been isolated, just as they should be. We'll leave some of our personnel here to control the situation in the vault. Discipline and order - that's the thing that is needed the most in your little undeveloped zoo.}
{124}{}{像你这样的其他人都被孤立了，就像他们应该被孤立一样。我们会留下一些人员来控制保险库的情况。纪律和秩序-这是你的未开发的小动物园最需要的东西。}
#{125}{}{I don??t have the component.}
{125}{}{我没有组件。}
#{126}{}{Fine, I??ll bring the component.}
{126}{}{好的，我把零件拿来。}
#{127}{}{You don??t have it? Then find it and bring it to me, you stupid creature!}
{127}{}{你没有吗？那就去找给我，你这个蠢货！}
#{128}{}{[Leave]}
{128}{}{[离开]}
#{129}{}{You made the right choice. We'll be watching you. Don??t try to be a hero and disobey us - and no one is going to suffer. You don??t want to SUFFER, do you?}
{129}{}{你做了正确的选择。我们会看着你的。不要试图成为英雄而不服从我们――没有人会受苦的。你不想受苦吧？}
#{130}{}{[Leave]}
{130}{}{[离开]}
#{131}{}{You call yourself a colonel, but you look and talk like a hillbilly in the bar.}
{131}{}{你自称上校，但你在酒吧里的样子和谈吐都像个乡下人。}
#{160}{}{Bring me that device, before I lose my patience entirely.}
{160}{}{把那个装置给我，免得我完全失去耐心。}
#{161}{}{I have the device. Take it and leave me alone.}
{161}{}{我有这个装置。拿着它别管我。}
#{162}{}{I brought you something better - a bullet in your stupid head. Take it and sign below!}
{162}{}{我给你带了更好的东西-一颗子弹打中你愚蠢的脑袋。拿着它在下面签名！}
#{163}{}{I will do as you asked.}
{163}{}{我会照你说的做。}
#{164}{}{Smart choice. You just made it a little easier on yourself...}
{164}{}{明智的选择。你只是让自己轻松一点...}
#{165}{}{[End]}
{165}{}{[结束]}
#{1162}{}{I brought you something better - a bullet in your stupid head. Take it and sign below!}
{1162}{}{我给你带了更好的东西-一颗子弹打中你愚蠢的脑袋。拿着它在下面签名！}
