{10}{}{嗯？再来一个？没关系，你不会痛苦太久的。只有你足够幸运能变成像我一样的人。。。}
### {11}{002}{What? What are you talking about, you monster?}

{14}{999}{我想我该走了。}


### {20}{}{Monster!? Monster... Yeah, I guess that's how it is. I've been a "monster" for many years now. The name's Priestley - and I WAS Priestley once if you know what I mean. Because now I'm "that".}
{20}{}{怪物怪物是的，我想事情就是这样。多年来我一直是个“怪物”。我的名字叫普里斯特利，如果你知道我的意思的话，我曾经是普里斯特利。因为现在我是“那个”。}

### {33}{999}{Looks like it's all bullshit and fairy tales. I'm out of here.}
{33}{999}{看起来都是胡说八道和童话故事。我要离开这里。}


### {100}{}{[He looks at you with his sad, cloudy, ghoul's eyes] Oh, you again? [sighs] How are you? Living by?}
{100}{}{[他用悲伤的、模糊的、食尸鬼的眼睛看着你]哦，又是你吗？[叹气]你好吗？靠什么生活？}

{109}{999}{事实上，我得走了。}



### {200}{}{Well, if you really want to know... [he sighs] I was once a missionary of a great god named [he furiously spits] Chiefacus. I carried his word all around the Radius, telling every peasant about the heavens and thirty beautiful virgins, awaiting them after death... And now you see how harshly Chiefacus [he furiously spits] dealt with me. I was so handsome, my beautiful holy chin dimple could get me between the legs of any woman... [he rolls eyes, pondering into memories] But then I withered.}
{200}{}{如果你真的想知道。。。[他叹了口气]我曾经是一位名叫基耶法库斯的大神的传教士。我把他的话传遍了整个半径，告诉每个农民天堂和三十个美丽的处女，死后等待他们。。。现在你可以看到基耶法库斯（他愤怒地吐唾沫）对我是多么严厉。我太帅了，我美丽的神圣下巴酒窝可以让我夹在任何女人的两腿之间。。。[他翻白眼，沉思着回忆]但后来我枯萎了。}
### {201}{021}{What do you mean? Did you get sick?}
{201}{021}{你是什么意思？你生病了吗？}
### {202}{}{I was a handsome man once, but the Gods [he furiously spits] cursed me, and I turned into THIS. What else can be said?.. Thank God [he furiously spits] that Robin brought me here, or I would have been eaten by jackals in the desert.}
{202}{}{我曾经是一个英俊的男人，但上帝（他愤怒地吐唾沫）诅咒我，我变成了这个。还能说什么？。。感谢上帝[他愤怒地吐唾沫]是罗宾把我带到这里的，否则我会在沙漠里被豺狼吃掉的。}
### {203}{010}{So the Gods cursed you? I see. I have another question.}
{203}{010}{所以上帝诅咒了你？我明白了。我还有一个问题。}


### {210}{}{Yes, probably I did. Chiefacus, may he burn in his hell, put some illness on me, as I went to nap in the shadow of a mountain cliff. I woke up already like this. Skin sagging and rotting, fell-off nose, the jaw barely holding up... Do you see what I've become!? Curse you, Gods, existing or not!!}
{210}{}{是的，可能是我做的。基耶法库斯，当我在山崖的阴影下打盹时，愿他在地狱里燃烧，给我带来一些疾病。我已经这样醒来了。皮肤下垂腐烂，从鼻子上掉下来，下巴几乎撑不起来。。。你看到我变成什么样子了吗！？诅咒你，上帝，无论存在与否！！}
### {211}{010}{Yeah, tough luck. I have another question.}
{211}{010}{是的，运气不好。我还有一个问题。}
### {212}{999}{I see it's better to leave you alone for a while.}
{212}{999}{我明白了，还是让你一个人呆一会儿比较好。}


### {300}{}{This is our home - or the hole we live in, I'd say. Here's where outcasts are settled in - I mean everyone who couldn't fit into the Radius. As you see, there are a lot of ones like you. Naive fools, why didn't they sit tight in their Tartarus, getting their stomachs full...}
{300}{}{这是我们的家，或者说是我们生活的洞。这里是被遗弃者的安置地――我指的是所有无法融入Radius的人。正如你所看到的，有很多人和你一样。天真的傻瓜，为什么他们不坐在他们的鞑靼，让他们的胃饱。。。}
### {301}{031}{I got that, but what IS this place actually? I see some huge machines...}
{301}{031}{我知道了，但这个地方到底是什么？我看到一些巨大的机器。。。}
### {302}{010}{Probably, you're right. I have another question.}
{302}{010}{也许，你是对的。我还有一个问题。}
### {303}{999}{I'm tired of talking. See you.}
{303}{999}{我厌倦了说话。再见}


### {310}{}{I think it was called "the subway" before the War. It is said that people were digging long tunnels underground to drive other people around on big iron carriages... It sounds very stupid, if you ask me. It is much easier to move by the surface. What I mean is that nowadays no one knows why the hell this place was created, but at least it gives us some protection against wild beasts.}
{310}{}{我认为它在战前被称为“地铁”。据说，人们在地下挖长隧道，用大铁车载着其他人四处走动。。。如果你问我的话，这听起来很愚蠢。靠表面移动要容易得多。我的意思是，现在没有人知道这个地方为什么会被创造出来，但至少它给了我们一些抵御野兽的保护。}
### {311}{032}{Fascinating! I want to know more!}
{311}{032}{极有吸引力的我想知道更多！}
### {312}{010}{Interesting. I have other questions.}
{312}{010}{有趣的我还有其他问题。}


### {320}{}{Sorry, but that's all I know. Maybe Bono could tell you more. It is him who told us about "the subway". Although... You know, he slowly loses it. As we all are.}
{320}{}{对不起，我只知道这些。也许波诺可以告诉你更多。是他告诉我们“地铁”的事。虽然你知道，他慢慢地失去了它。就像我们大家一样。}
### {321}{010}{Hm. I'll think about it. Another question.}
{321}{010}{嗯。我会考虑的。另一个问题。}


### {400}{}{Oh, THAT... Yes, I'm trying to grow some corn, but it's not working out. There was a girl from Tartarus with full pockets of seeds. She told me you could grow your food right beneath your feet.}
{400}{}{哦，那。。。是的，我想种一些玉米，但没有效果。有一个来自塔尔塔罗斯的女孩，口袋里装满了种子。她告诉我你可以把食物种在脚下。}
### {401}{041}{So? What could go wrong?}
{401}{041}{所以可能出了什么问题？}
### {402}{999}{Oh, I know, what it is. No, I'm not interested.}
{402}{999}{哦，我知道，是什么。不，我不感兴趣。}


### {410}{}{I don't even know... I wasted a lot of time disassembling the floor tiles, preparing the soil, making patches... I even watered the crops! But I only grew stems and no cobs! [he grabs his head] Probably the soil should be fertilized, but it seems that Lavash manure only makes it worse!}
{410}{}{我甚至不知道。。。我浪费了很多时间拆卸地砖、准备土壤、制作补丁。。。我甚至给庄稼浇水！但我只长茎，没有穗轴！[他抓着头]也许土壤应该施肥，但熔岩粪便似乎只会让情况变得更糟！}
### {411}{042}{Maybe you need something else then? Man, I could really use Catty's advice on that.}
{411}{042}{也许你还需要别的东西？伙计，我真的可以利用凯蒂的建议。}


### {420}{}{Yeah, there is even a recipe for creating a real fertilizer, I know it... I just can't make it - have no components. And, uh, no skill... Maybe if you could bring me a little bag of it? I don't have much, but I would find what to repay you with.}
{420}{}{是的，甚至有一个制作真正肥料的配方，我知道……我就是做不出来――没有成分。而且，呃，没有技巧。。。也许你能给我拿一小袋？我没有多少钱，但我会想办法报答你的。}
### {421}{QA}{Sure, why not? Tell me details, what should I do?}
{421}{QA}{当然，为什么不呢？告诉我细节，我该怎么办？}
### {422}{999}{Uh, no, sorry. The fertilizers are not my specialty. I need to go.}
{422}{999}{不，对不起。肥料不是我的专长。我得走了。}


### {430}{}{Great! I'm counting on you! Listen carefully: you need to take a bag of leaves, around two stacks will do. Throw in a mashed apple and sprinkle it with some ash. After that, you should pour a bottle of whiskey into the mixture, lock the bag tight and shake it to start the fermentation process. And that's it. Not very hard, right? Except I have no time to deal with the matter. And the whiskey is not cheap, you know. There was a rumor that dwellers of some elite vault in the Radius have so much that it pours out, but is it true? I don't know, sadly...}
{430}{}{太棒了我指望你！仔细听：你需要拿一袋叶子，大约两堆就可以了。放入一个苹果泥，撒上一些灰烬。之后，你应该把一瓶威士忌倒进混合物中，把袋子锁紧，摇晃它，开始发酵过程。就这样。不是很难，对吧？只是我没有时间处理这件事。而且威士忌也不便宜。有传言说，Radius某个精英金库的居民拥有如此多的财富，以至于倾盆而出，但这是真的吗？我不知道，很遗憾。。。}
### {431}{999}{Understood. Well, I think I can easily handle it, don't worry.}
{431}{999}{明白了。好吧，我想我可以轻松应付，别担心。}
### {432}{999}{Hah. Well, I can find some apples. If I can find some apples, I can find other stuff too. Wait for your fertilizer, I'll be right back.}
{432}{999}{哈。嗯，我能找到一些苹果。如果我能找到一些苹果，我也能找到其他的东西。等一下你的肥料，我马上回来。}


### {500}{}{Yes? My corns are waiting!}
{500}{}{对我的鸡眼在等着呢！}
### {501}{999}{Sorry, it's not done yet.}
{501}{999}{对不起，还没有完成。}
### {502}{051}{Go make them happy then! Here's the bag of fertilizer you need. [give Priestley a stinky bag]}
{502}{051}{那就去让他们开心吧！这是你需要的肥料袋。[给普里斯特利一个臭袋子]}


### {510}{}{[Priestley readily takes the fertilizer from your hands] At last the holy Chiefacus favors me again! Maybe I shouldn't have been so harsh to him? Thanks, my friend, may the thirty virgins be with you after you die! If I get any harvest - I'll definitely share!}
{510}{}{【普里斯特利欣然从你手中接过肥料】最后，神圣的基耶法库斯再次眷顾了我！也许我不应该对他那么苛刻？谢谢你，我的朋友，愿你死后那三十个处女和你在一起！如果我有收获，我一定会分享！}
### {511}{999}{Come on, this wasn't so hard at all. Good luck to you in your gardening.}
{511}{999}{拜托，这一点都不难。祝你在园艺方面好运。}
### {512}{052}{That was not the deal! Pay 15 batteries!}
{512}{052}{这不是交易！付15节电池费！}


### {520}{}{[Priestley's eyes slowly pop out] W-w-wh-what? B-b-bu-but I d-do-don't h-have s-s-uch m-money...}
{520}{}{[普里斯特利的眼睛慢慢地瞪了出来]W-W-wh-what？我没有那么多钱。。。}
### {521}{Recket}{Time to pay your debts. I'll come back in a couple of days. I want my batteries. I don't care where you get it. Go.}
{521}{Recket}{是时候偿还债务了。我过几天就回来。我想要我的电池。我不在乎你从哪里得到的，去吧。}
### {522}{999}{I was just kidding. Your gratitude is enough. Good luck, Priestley.}
{522}{999}{我只是开玩笑。你的感激之情已经足够了。祝你好运，普里斯特利。}




### {600}{}{Yes! The fertilizer really helped! The corn started to yield a harvest. Here, have some cobs [gives you some corn cobs] Take it, I won't take no for an answer!}
{600}{}{对肥料真的有帮助！玉米开始收获了。给，吃点玉米棒[给你一些玉米棒]吃吧，我不会接受否定的回答！}
### {601}{999}{Hah, well, thanks. Glad to be of help.}
{601}{999}{哈，好吧，谢谢。很高兴能提供帮助。}
### {602}{}{Yes, I think all goes better than before. In a few days I'll take harvest!}
{602}{}{是的，我认为一切都比以前好。过几天我就要收割了！}
### {603}{999}{Glad I could help. Good luck.}
{603}{999}{很高兴我能帮忙。祝你好运}


### {700}{}{B-bu-but I d-don't h-have s-s-uch m-money... I-I-I am ho-h-honestly try to find them, b-b-bu-but... Oh, m-man...}
{700}{}{我没有那么多钱。。。我-我-我在努力寻找他们，b-b-but。。。哦，伙计。。。}
### {701}{999}{Try better, or else!}
{701}{999}{试得更好，否则！}
### {702}{RecketOff}{Okay, I forgive you your debt. Don't make any promises if you can't live up to them.}
{702}{RecketOff}{好吧，我原谅你的债务。如果你不能兑现承诺，就不要做出任何承诺。}
