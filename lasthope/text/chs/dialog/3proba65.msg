{100}{}{[You find yourself in a dark and cold cave-like hall. Feels like a dungeon of some sort but not like those you
 have heard of in stories of old, this seems more real... Some awful odor spreads all over the place like a thin haze
 you see around you. Suddenly you hear a voice.] ...you bear the scars of a troubled past, but they healed well. I'm
 curious, do you know why you are here, sinner?}
{101}{}{I have no idea... where the hell are you!?}
{102}{}{Wait 'till this sinner gets you, you bastard!}
#idea...
{103}{}{Take your time, your vision is still blurry. You were brought here some moons ago. Our patrols found you
 in the great red desert. What you were doing there? We don't know. I suppose you were exiled for your crimes, what
 ever they were, or left for dead when there was nothing more you could do wrong...}
{104}{}{So, what am I doing here?}
#
{105}{}{Ah, your case is a tough one. Since you had an amnesia, caused by a severe trauma to the head, we can't find
 out anything about your past. Your recovery process took so long and we had to perform several operations on you in
 order to save your life. But you should feel privileged because many before you weren't so lucky. We saw potential in
 you. Still, we have to evaluate your physical and mental state before we continue. We prepared some tests for you,
 it would help the both of us if you could cooperate. And remember, you are here because we want to help you...}
{106}{}{How... What do I get when I finish these tests?}
{107}{}{I just want out of here. You hear me!?}
#how...
{108}{}{First of all, knowledge. There's so much you CAN do if you only know HOW. And
 that's what you are going to learn here. Everything else will come in due time.}
{109}{}{I don't like this but I guess I don't have much of a choice. What is my first test?}
#
{110}{}{There are six chambers in front of you. Certain items have been placed inside each one. You have to figure
 out what to do once you've collected them all... Take your time, look around, and watch out for "obstacles". You'll
 soon see what I'm talking about. And remember, you have to consume food and water, a sound mind in a sound body.
 Choose not to do so... well, makes my job easier. Now prove yourself...}
{111}{}{But where...?}
#after wait till this sinner gets you... and dude option is line 104
{112}{}{No, no, don't be so primitive. That attitude won't help you to survive. You are here because of that... Good
 solutions were always the smart ones. You will choose your own frame of mind eventually. But while you are here,
 you need to listen.}
#after 107... and dude option is line 109
{113}{}{You can end this whenever you choose to. But there's only one way out.}
#
{114}{}{Indeed, you are getting better. Now, we are going to have some unarmed combat practice. You must defend
 yourself if you want to survive this one...}
{115}{}{Alright.}
#
{116}{}{Good, your progress is remarkable. I will stand aside now. Proceed to the next test. My assistant will be
 waiting for you.}
{117}{}{I'm going.}
#Stupid character... after 100
{118}{}{Whaaa... who?}
{119}{}{Agrrhh... grrr!}
#
{120}{}{What's wrong with you? I asked a simple question. Do you understand what I'm saying?}
{121}{}{Uhuh.}
{122}{}{Nuuh.}
#
{123}{}{[Talking to someone else.] Another failure I'm afraid. Our subject here has some serious mental issues. How
 did you let this happen!? [Sighs.] There's only one way to correct this. Terminate subject...}
{124}{}{Naaaaahh...}
