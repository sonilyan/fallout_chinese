### {109}{}{Well, this is an old gas station. It was built a long time ago... My grandpa built it as a matter of fact. It's one of the last gas stations of this kind around these here parts. Heh, and the bad part is... Those pumps are empty if you wanna know. Sometimes even months pass until someone stops by. Business was good while those caravans were still coming, I really don't know what happened to them. Even an old, rusty gas station like this costs me money...}
{109}{}{这是一个旧的加油站。它是很久以前建的。。。事实上是我爷爷建的。这是这里最后一个加油站。嘿，糟糕的是…如果你想知道的话，那些水泵是空的。有时甚至几个月过去了，直到有人路过。当那些大篷车还在来的时候，生意很好，我真的不知道他们发生了什么。即使是像这样一个老旧生锈的加油站也要我花钱。。。}

### {115}{}{You sure have a lot of problems, old man.}
{115}{}{你肯定有很多问题，老人家。}
### {116}{}{I've adopted him. His parents left him, few years ago. Actually, there was a rumor his parents were killed because of some debts. Nobody really knows what happened to them. They disappeared just like that. [Snaps his fingers.] Anyway, I'm trying to raise him as best as I can. Now he's helping me running this gas station. To me, he'll always be my little boy.}
{116}{}{我收养了他。他的父母几年前就离开了他。事实上，有传言说他的父母是因为一些债务而被杀害的。没有人真正知道他们发生了什么。他们就这样消失了。[拍他的手指。]不管怎样，我正在尽力把他养大。现在他在帮我经营这个加油站。对我来说，他永远是我的小儿子。}

### {124}{}{This is... very generous of you! It's gonna help us a lot. I'm gonna buy my kid some textbooks with it. Perhaps even some new clothes will be good as well. I don't know how to repay you... I got this ammo, I'm sure you can make better use of it.}
{124}{}{你真是太慷慨了！这对我们有很大帮助。我要用它给我的孩子买一些课本。也许甚至一些新衣服也会很好。我不知道该怎么报答你。。。我有这个弹药，我相信你能更好地利用它。}

### {128}{}{As far as I know they were usually coming from Miners Town. I heard that the mine isn't working anymore because the machines they were using became too old for their own good, and started consuming *lotsa* fuel. Those caravans came here precisely because of the fuel, but they haven't shown up in quite some time now.}
{128}{}{据我所知，他们通常来自矿工镇。我听说矿井已经不工作了，因为他们使用的机器太旧了，对他们自己不利，开始消耗大量燃料。那些大篷车来这里正是因为燃料，但他们已经有很长一段时间没有出现了。}
### {129}{}{Thanks.}
{129}{}{谢谢}
### {130}{}{Well, it's indeed hard to withstand, but I have to be here at all times in case someone shows up, someone like you. Otherwise, people just keep walking past this old junk.}
{130}{}{嗯，这确实很难承受，但我必须一直在这里，以防有人出现，像你这样的人。否则，人们只是不断地从这些旧垃圾旁边走过。}
