### {105}{}{Hey, you helped Fred. I'm glad that someone did the job right. But there's something more important you must do now. You see, there's a water problem in this region. The residents of Golden Valley are not experiencing this yet, because we are covering their water losses with our own reserves, but...}
{105}{}{嘿，你帮了弗雷德。我很高兴有人做得对。但你现在必须做一些更重要的事情。你看，这个地区有水资源问题。金谷的居民还没有经历这种情况，因为我们正在用自己的储备来弥补他们的水损失，但是。。。}
### {106}{}{Let me guess... You are running low on water?}
{106}{}{让我猜猜。。。你缺水了？}

{115}{}{我得到了这个水芯片。在这里看一看。}

{116}{}{这似乎是一个升级的型号，但你猜怎么着。。。这该死的东西坏了！缺少一个电容器。[用她的手指给你看。]你得给我一个有效的！}

{125}{}{是的，这个就行了…[看着你。]很抱歉我刚才对你大喊大叫。这项工作让我很紧张，有很多文书工作，你知道吗？感谢您的服务，私人。你现在可以回去工作了。}
### {126}{}{Sure thing.}
{126}{}{当然可以}
### {127}{}{Sorry, no clue. You'll just have to find it... It's old hardware, but still in use by most water systems. }
{127}{}{抱歉，没有线索。你只需要找到它……它是旧硬件，但大多数供水系统仍在使用。}
