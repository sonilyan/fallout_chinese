#{100}{}{You see an old man.}
{100}{}{你看到一个老人。}
#{101}{}{You see an old man Jed.}
{101}{}{你看到一个老头杰德。}
#{102}{}{You see an old man with gray curls on his head, dressed in an old pair of pajamas.}
{102}{}{你看到一个头上有灰色卷发的老人，穿着一件旧睡衣。}
#{103}{}{You see Jedediah Smith, probably the oldest resident of Black Rock.}
{103}{}{你看杰迪迪亚・史密斯，可能是黑岩最老的居民。}
#{110}{}{I always say "it's nice to meet you", when it isn't nice at all. But if you want to coexist with people, you have to compromise. Remember that.}
{110}{}{当一点都不好的时候，我总是说“很高兴见到你”。但如果你想与人共处，你必须妥协。记住这一点。}
#{111}{}{Uh, sure. And you are... ?}
{111}{}{呃，当然。你是？}
#{112}{}{What?}
{112}{}{什么？}
#{113}{}{Hmm? Oh, just thinking out loud is all. My name is Jedediah Smith. It's nice to meet you. I'm a local heirloom, you could say... Perhaps, the oldest man in Nevada. Among those that are still humans, that is.}
{113}{}{隐马尔可夫模型？哦，只是大声思考而已。我叫杰迪迪亚・史密斯。很高兴见到你。我是当地的传家宝，你可以说。。。也许是内华达州最老的男人。在那些仍然是人类的人当中，那就是。}
#{114}{}{My name is }
{114}{}{我的名字是}
#{115}{}{. It's an honor to meet you, Mister Smith.}
{115}{}{. 很荣幸见到你，史密斯先生。}
#{116}{}{Oh, okay.}
{116}{}{哦，好吧。}
#{117}{}{You're as old as the wasteland, and just as fucked up. I get it.}
{117}{}{你和荒原一样老，也一样糟糕。我明白了。}
#{118}{}{Oh, such manners! [he smiles] A rarity in these parts.}
{118}{}{哦，真有礼貌！[他笑了]这些地方很少见。}
#{119}{}{Why, thank you.}
{119}{}{为什么，谢谢你。}
#{120}{}{[He sighs] I, too, was rude when I was young. Now, I see how unnecessary it is.}
{120}{}{我年轻的时候也很粗鲁。现在，我明白这是多么不必要。}
#{121}{}{I wanted to ask you something.}
{121}{}{我想问你一件事。}
#{122}{}{[He looks at you with lidded eyes, then shakes his head in disapproval] You don't seem to be dangerous, so I'll continue talking to you.}
{122}{}{[他戴着眼罩看着你，然后不赞成地摇摇头]你看起来并不危险，所以我会继续和你说话。}
#{123}{}{Uh, good.}
{123}{}{呃，很好。}
#{130}{}{What do you want from me, young man?}
{130}{}{年轻人，你想从我这里得到什么？}
#{131}{}{Nothing right now. Goodbye.}
{131}{}{现在什么都没有。再见。}
#{132}{}{Oh, I think about this a lot... }
{132}{}{哦，我想了很多。。。}
#{133}{}{Hmm, perhaps... }
{133}{}{嗯，也许。。。}
#{134}{}{Why not?..}
{134}{}{为什么不？。。}
#{135}{}{Maybe... }
{135}{}{也许 吧。。。}
#{136}{}{Well, listen... }
{136}{}{好吧，听着。。。}
#{137}{}{I wanted to tell this for a long time... }
{137}{}{我想告诉你很久了。。。}
#{138}{}{With pleasure! How about that?}
{138}{}{很高兴见到你！怎么样？}
#{139}{}{Just a second... }
{139}{}{等一下。。。}
#{140}{}{You must have seen a lot in your time. Can you give me some advice?}
{140}{}{你一定见过很多。你能给我一些建议吗？}
#{141}{}{The weak eats the weaker to get stronger. This is the basis for all of our lives.}
{141}{}{弱者吃弱者来变得更强。这是我们所有生活的基础。}
#{142}{}{One day, you'll have to decide, where to go. And when you decide it, go without even a second of hesitation.}
{142}{}{总有一天，你要决定，去哪里。当你决定的时候，毫不犹豫地走。}
#{143}{}{People try to plan what they'll do ahead of time, but this is impossible. No one can really know what is to come.}
{143}{}{人们试图提前计划他们将要做什么，但这是不可能的。没有人能真正知道接下来会发生什么。}
#{144}{}{People don't change between the ages of ten and twenty... Nor between ten and eighty.}
{144}{}{人在十岁到二十岁之间是不会变的。。。十岁到八十岁之间也不行。}
#{145}{}{An immature man thinks he should die for what is right. A mature man knows he must live for what is right.}
{145}{}{一个不成熟的人认为他应该为正义而死。一个成熟的人知道他必须为正义而活。}
#{146}{}{If someone wants to push you around, the worst thing you can do to him is pretend he doesn't bother you at all.}
{146}{}{如果有人想推你，你能对他做的最糟糕的事就是假装他根本不打扰你。}
#{147}{}{You must laugh through what tortures you, or you will lose perspective, and then the world will be lost to you.}
{147}{}{你必须笑透折磨你的东西，否则你将失去视角，然后世界将失去你。}
#{148}{}{You can only notice change in a man after you've left him for a time. If you see him every day, you won't notice anything, because a man changes slowly.}
{148}{}{只有离开一个人一段时间后，你才能注意到他身上的变化。如果你每天都见到他，你不会注意到任何东西，因为一个人变化很慢。}
#{149}{}{True strength is seeing the funny side in everything.}
{149}{}{真正的力量是看到事物有趣的一面。}
#{150}{}{If you aren't careful, people will control you. You will either do what they want, or you will devote yourself to doing what they don't want.}
{150}{}{如果你不小心，人们会控制你。你要么做他们想做的事，要么专心做他们不想做的事。}
#{151}{}{When I die, send me to the heavens.}
{151}{}{当我死了，把我送到天堂。}
#{152}{}{Hmm... Can you tell me something else?}
{152}{}{隐马尔可夫模型。。。你能告诉我些别的吗？}
#{153}{}{I think that's enough wisdom for today.}
{153}{}{我想今天的智慧已经足够了。}
#{160}{}{I'm happy to see you, my boy. You've done a lot of good for Black Rock, especially for those who needed it most. I would like to thank you. Please, take the healing powder from that shelf. You may need it.}
{160}{}{很高兴见到你，孩子。你为黑岩做了很多好事，尤其是对那些最需要它的人。我想谢谢你。请把那架子上的疗伤粉拿出来。你可能需要它。}
#{161}{}{Thanks... }
{161}{}{谢谢。。。}
#{170}{}{Tell me about yourself.}
{170}{}{跟我说说你自己。}
#{171}{}{I am Jedediah Smith. You might say, I founded this place. I was a traveler in my youth... When my legs became old, I sought a place to rest in my last years. I chose this beautiful valley.}
{171}{}{我是杰迪迪亚・史密斯。你可能会说，这地方是我建的。我年轻时是个旅行者。。。当我的腿老了，我在我的最后几年寻找一个地方休息。我选择了这个美丽的山谷。}
#{172}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{172}{}{我能问你点别的吗？}
#{173}{}{Did you travel a lot?}
{173}{}{你经常旅行吗？}
#{174}{}{Oh, yes, a long time ago. I wanted to find a good place where people can live, but it seemed there were no more such places on Earth. As I got older, I tired of my search and went east, inland. That's how I found Reno. To me, then, it was heaven, but when it got too... Hmm... Loud, I suppose, I left for a small place where I could be alone. It turns out I couldn't, even here.}
{174}{}{哦，是的，很久以前。我想找一个人们可以居住的好地方，但似乎地球上再也没有这样的地方了。随着年龄的增长，我厌倦了我的寻找，向东，内陆。我就是这样找到雷诺的。对我来说，那是天堂，但当它变得太。。。隐马尔可夫模型。。。我想，我是大声地去了一个小地方，在那里我可以一个人呆着。结果我不能，即使在这里。}
#{175}{}{Can you tell me of any interesting places in Nevada?}
{175}{}{你能告诉我内华达州有什么有趣的地方吗？}
#{176}{}{To the south you'll have the Cheyenne tribe, and further - New Reno. Gerlach is to the west. I don't think there is anything else worth mentioning around here. Far to the east is Salt Lake City, but I've not been there, so I can't tell you exactly where.}
{176}{}{南边是夏延部落，再往前就是新雷诺。杰拉克在西边。我不认为这里还有什么值得一提的。最东边是盐湖城，但我还没去过，所以我不能告诉你确切的位置。}
#{177}{}{Thank you. Can I ask another question?}
{177}{}{非常感谢。我能再问一个问题吗？}
#{178}{}{How did this community get started?}
{178}{}{这个社区是怎么开始的？}
#{179}{}{When I got tired of the excitement in New Reno, I chose to live my last years in isolation. A caravan took me to this valley, but others followed my footsteps. William and Justin were the first, and rumors about good life brought others. If not for me, there would be no life here. [he smiles] It is... A different sort of excitement, isn't it?}
{179}{}{当我厌倦了在新雷诺的兴奋时，我选择了孤独地度过我的最后几年。一辆大篷车把我带到这个山谷，但其他人跟着我的脚步走。威廉和贾斯汀是第一个，关于美好生活的谣言带来了其他人。如果不是我，这里就没有生命。[他微笑]是。。。另一种刺激，不是吗？}
#{180}{}{What do you think of William?}
{180}{}{你觉得威廉怎么样？}
#{181}{}{What do you think of Justin?}
{181}{}{你觉得贾斯汀怎么样？}
#{182}{}{You can tell he came from a good family. He's friendly and generous, but too trusting of strangers. It had hurt him in the past, but it's because of him we have so many good people here.}
{182}{}{你看得出他来自一个好家庭。他友好大方，但太相信陌生人。过去他很受伤，但正是因为他，我们这里才有这么多好人。}
#{183}{}{Hard and venomous, like a radscorpion. But that's how radscorpions keep their nests safe. His mistrust is useful in its own way.}
{183}{}{又硬又毒，像只蝎子。但这就是蝎子保护巢穴的方式。他的不信任本身就是有用的。}
#{184}{}{How do William and Justin influence the community?}
{184}{}{威廉和贾斯汀如何影响社区？}
#{185}{}{Directly and radically. William tries to make the community open, by letting everyone in and establishing trade routes with other settlements. Justin wants to keep us safe by isolating us. They're both acting for the good of the community, and they're both right. If we removed either of them, Black Rock would fall.}
{185}{}{直接而彻底地。威廉试图让社区开放，让每个人都进来，并建立与其他定居点的贸易路线。贾斯汀想通过孤立我们来保护我们的安全。他们都是为了社区的利益，他们都是对的。如果我们移走他们中的任何一个，黑石就会倒下。}
#{186}{}{Smith marks the locations on your map.}
{186}{}{史密斯在你的地图上标出了地点。}
#{190}{}{Let's talk about Jasmine.}
{190}{}{我们来谈谈茉莉花。}
#{191}{}{Jasmine? Oh, be careful with her, she's quite the character. But her coarse tongue is not the real problem. No... The sin in her blood and on her skin - that is the real problem.}
{191}{}{茉莉花？哦，小心她，她很有个性。但她的粗口不是真正的问题。不。。。她血液和皮肤上的罪恶才是真正的问题。}
#{192}{}{What are you talking about?}
{192}{}{你在说什么？}
#{193}{}{You probably already know she is sick. A skin disease - I've seen it before, and believe me, it ends badly.}
{193}{}{你可能已经知道她病了。一种皮肤病-我以前见过，相信我，结果很糟糕。}
#{194}{}{You've seen it before? When and where?}
{194}{}{你以前见过吗？何时何地？}
#{195}{}{Does anyone else here have this disease?}
{195}{}{这里还有人有这种病吗？}
#{196}{}{Can she be cured?}
{196}{}{她能治好吗？}
#{197}{}{In Reno, after the war. People were too busy with fighting, to bother with hygiene, and where the streets weren't slick with blood, they were swarmed with garbage, rats, stray dogs... It's no surprise the plague started. If they hadn't found the cure, then, maybe, there would not be a Reno today.}
{197}{}{在里诺，战后。人们忙于打仗，无暇顾及卫生，在血迹斑斑的街道上，到处都是垃圾、老鼠、流浪狗。。。瘟疫开始并不奇怪。如果他们没有找到治疗方法，那么，也许，今天就不会有雷诺了。}
#{198}{}{No, not for now. It was already inside her when she came here, and though she hid it, we figured it out before anything happened. Thankfully, I don't think it spreads except by, ah, physical contact. In the biblical sense.}
{198}{}{不，现在不行。她来的时候已经在她体内了，虽然她把它藏了起来，但我们还是在事情发生之前就发现了。谢天谢地，我不认为它传播除了，啊，身体接触。在圣经的意义上。}
#{199}{}{They cured it in Reno a long time ago. Perhaps Jasmine can be cured too, but it's hard to tell.}
{199}{}{他们很久以前就在里诺治好了。也许茉莉花也可以治愈，但很难说。}
#{200}{}{What was the cure?}
{200}{}{治疗方法是什么？}
#{201}{}{A tincture of nightshade and some other ingredients. I don't remember exactly what - it's been too long. But a man with the right skills could figure it out.}
{201}{}{一种夜来香和一些其他成分的酊剂。我不记得到底是什么-太久了。但是一个有着正确技能的人可以找到答案。}
#{202}{}{Nightshade? A plant?}
{202}{}{夜来香？植物？}
#{203}{}{Exactly. Its poisonous berries were used in medicine since long before the war, but it is hard to find in the dry Nevada desert. And even if you do find it, do you know what to do with it?}
{203}{}{确切地。它的有毒浆果早在战前就被用于医药，但在干燥的内华达沙漠中很难找到。即使你真的找到了，你知道怎么处理它吗？}
#{204}{}{The berries are poisonous? They probably contain alkaloids. They're known to cause severe intoxication and could have an antibacterial effect.}
{204}{}{这些浆果有毒吗？它们可能含有生物碱。众所周知，它们会导致严重中毒，并可能具有抗菌作用。}
#{205}{}{It's worth a try. If I find some nightshade, maybe I can do something with it.}
{205}{}{值得一试。如果我能找到夜来香，也许我能用它做点什么。}
#{206}{}{Hmm? Well, if you say so, then you can try your hand at making the medicine yourself. You only have to find the plant. Ask the Cheyenne tribe to the south - if anyone would know, it would be then.}
{206}{}{隐马尔可夫模型？好吧，如果你这么说的话，那你可以自己动手做药了。你只要找到植物就行了。问问南方的夏延部落――如果有人知道的话，那就是那时了。}
#{207}{}{Just remember, don't try making the medicine if you don't know what you're doing. Nightshade is better known for taking life, than for restoring it.}
{207}{}{记住，如果你不知道自己在做什么，就不要试着做药。夜来香更出名的是夺走生命，而不是恢复生命。}
#{208}{}{Thank you for the information.}
{208}{}{谢谢你的信息。}
#{210}{}{We talked about nightshade earlier. Are these the berries?}
{210}{}{我们之前谈过夜色病。这些是浆果吗？}
#{211}{}{Yes, they are! But the berries alone are simply poison. If you combine them with healing herbs, the poison will heal the body, but reinforced with scorpion poison, it will be an extremely lethal toxin. If you want to make medicine of it, you'll need to learn how.}
{211}{}{是的，他们是！但单是浆果本身就是毒药。如果你把它们和治疗草药结合起来，毒药会治疗身体，但是用蝎子毒药强化，它将是一种致命的毒素。如果你想把它做成药，你就得学会怎么做。}
#{212}{}{How can I learn it?}
{212}{}{我该怎么学呢？}
#{213}{}{Hmm... I remember the tincture was boiled in clean water with some xander root and broc flower, but I don't remember the temperature and exact conditions. If you want to experiment, you can use the campfire just outside.}
{213}{}{隐马尔可夫模型。。。我记得酊剂是在清水中煮的，里面有一些仙人掌和椰子花，但我不记得温度和确切的条件。如果你想做实验，你可以利用外面的篝火。}
#{214}{}{I'll go try right now.}
{214}{}{我现在就去试试。}
#{250}{}{I need your advice regarding Milo.}
{250}{}{我需要你关于麦洛的建议。}
#{251}{}{My advice? Oh, no one has asked my advice for a very long time. Please, tell me everything.}
{251}{}{我的建议？哦，好久没人征求我的意见了。拜托，告诉我一切。}
#{252}{}{[Tell him the full story.]}
{252}{}{[告诉他全部情况。]}
#{253}{}{Actually, I'll just figure it out myself.}
{253}{}{实际上，我会自己想办法的。}
#{254}{}{[He listens carefully, but at some point you think he falls asleep.]}
{254}{}{[他仔细地听着，但有时你认为他睡着了。]}
#{255}{}{Um... }
{255}{}{嗯。。。}
#{256}{}{[He jerks upright] Hmm! Yes, very complicated indeed. Here is what I'll tell you: William and Justin always argue over what to do with the community, but they complete each other. Each has the strengths to compensate for each other's weaknesses. Without this balance, the Black Rock will fall.}
{256}{}{[他挺直身子]嗯！是的，确实很复杂。我要告诉你的是：威廉和贾斯汀总是为如何对待这个社区而争论不休，但他们却互相完善。每个人都有优势来弥补对方的弱点。如果没有这种平衡，黑石就会倒下。}
#{257}{}{Then what should I do with Eugene and the others?}
{257}{}{那我该拿尤金和其他人怎么办？}
#{258}{}{Try not to involve William or Justine. Convince Eugene himself - he is not so bad as he looks. He is a young man trying to prove himself, like all young men. Proving himself to raiders is a mistake, but mistakes can be corrected.}
{258}{}{尽量不要把威廉和贾斯汀牵扯进来。说服尤金自己――他并不像看上去那么坏。他和所有的年轻人一样，是一个试图证明自己的年轻人。向袭击者证明自己是个错误，但错误是可以纠正的。}
#{259}{}{That doesn't sound easy.}
{259}{}{听起来不容易。}
#{260}{}{And yes - William's deal to trade gecko skins to caravans will change the future of our community, if the caravans choose to come here. Raiders, slaves, prostitutes, murders - all these can scare caravans off.}
{260}{}{是的-威廉的交易壁虎皮商队将改变我们社区的未来，如果商队选择来这里。袭击者，奴隶，妓女，谋杀――所有这些都能吓跑商队。}
#{261}{}{Thank you, Mister Smith. You've been a huge help.}
{261}{}{谢谢你，史密斯先生。你帮了大忙。}
#{262}{}{That's it?! I could have figured that out myself!}
{262}{}{就这样？！我本可以自己想出来的！}
#{1122}{}{[He looks at you with lidded eyes, then shakes his head in disapproval] You don't seem to be dangerous, so I'll continue talking to you.}
{1122}{}{[他戴着眼罩看着你，然后不赞成地摇摇头]你看起来并不危险，所以我会继续和你说话。}
#{1130}{}{What do you want from me, young lady?}
{1130}{}{你想从我这里得到什么，小姐？}
#{1160}{}{I'm happy to see you, my girl. You've done a lot of good for Black Rock, especially for those who needed it most. I would like to thank you. Please, take the healing powder from that shelf. You may need it.}
{1160}{}{我很高兴见到你，我的女孩。你为黑岩做了很多好事，尤其是对那些最需要它的人。我想谢谢你。请把那架子上的疗伤粉拿出来。你可能需要它。}
#{1262}{}{That's it?! I could have figured that out myself!}
{1262}{}{就这样？！我本可以自己想出来的！}
