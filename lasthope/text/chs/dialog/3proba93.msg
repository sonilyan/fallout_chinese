### {100}{}{Yep, do you want something?}
{100}{}{是的，你想要什么吗？}
### {101}{}{What is this place?}
{101}{}{这是什么地方？}
### {102}{}{Who are you?}
{102}{}{你是谁？}
### {103}{}{No, just passing by.}
{103}{}{不，只是路过。}
### {104}{}{This is my car workshop. I can fix anything on a car and make it run just like it was brand new. Well, I think I do... since I haven't seen any working cars for years, I haven't had a chance to check if I'm still in shape. Anyway, if you need any of my services I might give you a discount, just keep that in mind.}
{104}{}{这是我的汽车车间。我可以修理汽车上的任何东西，让它像全新的一样运行。嗯，我想我是……因为我已经好几年没有看到任何工作车了，所以我没有机会检查我是否还保持着健康。不管怎样，如果你需要我的任何服务，我可能会给你折扣，记住这一点。}
### {105}{}{OK, let me ask you something.}
{105}{}{好的，让我问你一件事。}
### {106}{}{Thanks, I'll remember that.}
{106}{}{谢谢，我会记住的。}
### {107}{}{Nick is my name and I'm the local mechanic. Back in the day, people used to come here and ask me to fix almost every possible problem on a car you could think of. To say the truth, that was a long time ago. I haven't had any customer for years but I never lost hope. You never know when you are gonna hear a loud klaxon in your back yard! Know what I mean? [Laughs.]}
{107}{}{尼克是我的名字，我是当地的机修工。以前，人们经常来这里请我解决你能想到的汽车上几乎所有可能的问题。说实话，那是很久以前的事了。我已经好几年没有顾客了，但我从未失去希望。你永远不知道什么时候你会在后院听到响亮的喇叭声！知道我的意思吗？[大笑。]}
### {108}{}{Yeah... sure.}
{108}{}{是 啊当然}
### {109}{}{OK, let me ask you something.}
{109}{}{好的，让我问你一件事。}
### {110}{}{That's a nice story but I have to be on my way.}
{110}{}{这是一个很好的故事，但我必须上路。}
### {111}{}{I'm so convinced that people are going to start coming anytime soon... I'd better be prepared. Damn, I need a lot of car parts but I hardly know where to find them...}
{111}{}{我确信人们很快就会来。。。我最好做好准备。该死，我需要很多汽车零件，但我几乎不知道在哪里可以找到。。。}
### {112}{}{Can I help?}
{112}{}{我能帮忙吗？}
### {113}{}{Sorry to hear that.}
{113}{}{很抱歉听到这个消息。}
### {114}{}{Thanks for your time. I'm off then.}
{114}{}{谢谢你抽出时间。那我就走了。}
### {115}{}{I don't know... Wait, there's something I need. You can see I already got plenty of tires here, but most of these are worn out or damaged beyond repair. I just want to be sure I don't have to tell my customers that we're out of tires... can you imagine. That could be bad for business. So you need to find me some, I prefer 'em with profile. Ten pieces will be enough to fill up some empty shelves I have, and we'll talk about your payment when you find something. It's a deal?}
{115}{}{我不知道。。。等等，我需要一些东西。你可以看到，我这里已经有很多轮胎了，但大部分都磨损或损坏了，无法修复。我只是想确保我不必告诉我的客户我们的轮胎用完了。。。你能想象吗。这可能对商业不利。所以你需要给我找一些，我更喜欢有个人资料的。十件就足够填满我的一些空货架了，当你找到东西时，我们会讨论你的付款问题。这是交易吗？}
### {116}{}{You got it.}
{116}{}{你明白了。}
### {117}{}{I'll be back when I'm ready to take the job.}
{117}{}{当我准备好接受这份工作时，我会回来的。}

{118}{}{没必要。我还有几堆，所以如果供应不足，我会雇人找更多的。}
### {119}{}{Thanks for your time. I'm off then.}
{119}{}{谢谢你抽出时间。那我就走了。}
### {120}{}{Good. I suggest that you go to Farmers Town, they have an old gas station. I don't know who runs the place now, if it's run at all. Either way, you should start your search there.}
{120}{}{好的我建议你去农民镇，那里有一个旧的加油站。我不知道现在是谁在管理这个地方，如果有人在管理的话。不管怎样，你都应该从那里开始搜索。}
### {121}{}{OK, I'm off then.}
{121}{}{好的，那我就走。}
### {122}{}{I see you have some tires. Want to sell those to me?}
{122}{}{我看到你有一些轮胎。想卖给我吗？}
### {123}{}{They are all yours.}

### {131}{}{Right, I'll find more.}
{131}{}{好的，我会找到更多的。}
### {132}{}{So, want to find some tires for me, about a stack of ten?}
{132}{}{那么，想给我找一些轮胎吗，大约一堆十个？}
### {133}{}{Alright.}
{133}{}{好吧}
### {134}{}{Not yet.}
{134}{}{还没有。}
### {135}{}{Well, I don't see you carrying any tires... So, what are you doing here then?}
{135}{}{我没看到你带轮胎。。。那么，你在这里干什么？}
### {136}{}{Sorry, I'm going.}
{136}{}{对不起，我要走了。}
### {137}{}{Nothing, I'm going.}
{137}{}{没什么，我要走了。}
### {138}{}{Come to think of it, I'll need some tools for my workshop, can't get enough of them. [Smiles.] Are you interested in another job?}
{138}{}{想一想，我的车间需要一些工具，但不够用。你对另一份工作感兴趣吗？}

### {140}{}{Maybe later.}

### {141}{}{About that job...}
{141}{}{关于那份工作。。。}
### {142}{}{Like I said. I got some old tools here but they are either broken or rusty and there's an old saying, you'll never repair one junk with another. So those must go. I'll need one screwdriver and an adjustable wrench to be able to continue my garage. Can you get me those?}
{142}{}{就像我说的。我这里有一些旧工具，但它们要么坏了，要么生锈了。有句老话说，你永远不会用另一个来修理一个垃圾。所以这些必须离开。我需要一把螺丝刀和一把活动扳手才能继续我的车库。你能给我拿那些吗？}
### {143}{}{Sure thing.}
{143}{}{当然可以}
### {144}{}{Maybe. Do I get something for this?}
{144}{}{大概我有什么要做的吗？}
### {145}{}{I got something to do first, but I'll be back.}
{145}{}{我先有事情要做，但我会回来的。}
### {146}{}{Well, I have plenty of nuts and bolts. [Chuckles.] But I figured some money would be of better use. Only one condition though, bring me something useful.}
{146}{}{嗯，我有很多螺母和螺栓。但我觉得有些钱会更有用处。不过只有一个条件，给我一些有用的东西。}
### {147}{}{It's a deal, I'm off then.}
{147}{}{这是一笔交易，那我就走了。}
### {148}{}{I told you. I need a working screwdriver and an adjustable wrench. Bring me those and then we'll talk.}
{148}{}{我告诉过你。我需要一把能用的螺丝刀和一把活动扳手。把那些拿给我，然后我们再谈。}
### {149}{}{I'm on it.}
{149}{}{我在上面。}
### {150}{}{Let me see... [Looking at the tools you brought]. They'll do just fine, thanks. Here's $1000 for them. Now I can finally do something useful here...}
{150}{}{让我看看。。。[看看你带来的工具]。他们会做得很好的，谢谢。给他们1000美元。现在我终于可以在这里做一些有用的事情了。。。}
### {151}{}{Thanks, I'll leave you to your work.}
{151}{}{谢谢，我让你自己干吧。}
### {152}{}{Got any work for me?}
{152}{}{有工作给我吗？}
