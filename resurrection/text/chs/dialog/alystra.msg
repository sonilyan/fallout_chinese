{550}{}{[女人脸上露出温柔的微笑]一个有幽默感的陌生人？这不是常见的景象。你说得对。我是他的女儿。事实上，从现在起这个房间将是我自己的。父亲最近去世了。我正在检查他的个人资料，我已经把任务推迟了很长时间了。}

{601}{}{我很抱歉。呸。。。我是}
#{650}{}{Oh, I apologize for not introducing myself. My name is Lystra Harding-Stillson. Which is of no significance to you. Let us make it simpler, you can call me Lystra. I would be glad to talk to someone, at least I will come to new thoughts.}

{651}{}{你父亲的房间现在归你了？}
#{700}{}{This room is for one of the Emperor's advisers. It is a function I'm to take up after my father, along with taking over the imperial hospital. You see, I'm his only descendant here and of course a member of the Emperor's family. [She grins.]}

#{850}{}{Yes, he was very devoted to his work. He worked until the end of his life, even when he became old and his health declined.

#{1050}{}{That is a rather lengthy and complex story to tell. Are you sure you want to hear it? Stupid question, I guess. Why else would you have asked in the first place, right? My brother served in the imperial army. As every soldier, he considered it his duty to protect the empire, but he felt our army was not doing enough in that respect. He saw the Rebirth as too great a threat to use only passive defense against. He has tried to convince the empire to actively join the fight against the ghouls, to strain its muscles in order to stop the Rebirth completely. He failed. The main argument against it was that using the City's resources outside would make the empire too vulnerable. This is the eternal belief held by most of the dwellers, as old as the empire itself.}

{1052}{}{你对此有什么看法？}
#{1053}{}{So, what did he do?}
{1053}{}{那么，他做了什么？}
#{1100}{}{I think it's simply a fear of moving on. There are numerous good reasons to shy away from the surrounding world and I definitely disagree with Sindian regarding joining the open fight, but we should tend to the world around us more. We should strive to make the world around us a better place instead of tending to our tiny enclosed piece of it.}
{1100}{}{我想这只是害怕继续前进。有很多很好的理由回避周围的世界，我绝对不同意辛迪安加入公开斗争，但我们应该更倾向于我们周围的世界。我们应该努力使我们周围的世界变得更美好，而不是照顾我们那一小块封闭的世界。}
#{1101}{}{So what did your brother do once he failed to change the attitude of the empire?}
{1101}{}{那么，你哥哥在改变帝国态度失败后做了什么？}
#{1150}{}{He left the City. He joined those who embrace the open conflict with the Rebirth on a daily basis. He joined the Mutant Hunters. You aren't from around here, you cannot possibly conceive the significance of such act. We have agreements of cooperation with the Hunters, at least within certain borders. In fact, Sindian broke no rules by doing so. But the dwellers of the City consider it treason. He tried to protect the empire so fiercefully that he became an enemy to his own people. Our father was the one who had the most difficulty accepting it. When Sindian shared his plans with him before his departure, they had an ugly argument. That wast the last time they spoke. Father has refused to discuss him ever since. He always got mad whenever I started talking about my brother.}
{1150}{}{他离开了这个城市。他加入了那些每天以重生来拥抱公开冲突的人。他加入了变种猎人。你不是本地人，你不可能想象这种行为的意义。我们和猎人有合作协议，至少在某些边界内。事实上，辛典这样做并没有违反任何规则。但是城里的居民认为这是叛国。他极力保护帝国，结果成了自己人民的敌人。我们的父亲是最难接受的人。辛迪安临走前和他分享他的计划时，他们吵了一架。那不是他们最后一次说话了。从那以后父亲一直拒绝谈论他。每当我谈起我弟弟时，他总是很生气。}
#{1151}{}{I don't understand this attitude of the imperial dwellers. All the Hunters want is to protect humankind, stop the threat that Rebirth and all the mutants are.}
{1151}{}{我不理解帝国居民的这种态度。所有的猎人想要的是保护人类，阻止威胁重生和所有的变种人。}
#{1152}{}{Did Beldir share the opinion of the dwellers in this regard?}
{1152}{}{贝尔迪尔在这方面是否同意居民的意见？}
#{1153}{}{How did it go for Sindian with the Hunters? Is he no longer with them?}
{1153}{}{辛迪安和猎人相处得怎么样？他不再和他们在一起了吗？}
#{1200}{}{If it was that simple, but it isn't. Not with mutants and neither with the Mutant Hunters' intentions. You're one of them, am I right? I do not think you're automatically a bad person on account of it. I'm certain there are many Hunters with good intentions, just like my brother was, but I'd rather not discuss the issue of mutants and Hunters with you. Please, don't take it personally.}
{1200}{}{如果真的那么简单，但事实并非如此。这与变种人无关，也与变种猎人的意图无关。你是他们中的一员，对吗？我不认为你会因此自然而然地成为坏人。我敢肯定有很多猎人是出于好意，就像我哥哥一样，但我不想和你讨论变种人和猎人的问题。拜托，别把它当回事。}
#{1201}{}{How did it go for Sindian with the Hunters? Is he no longer with us?}
{1201}{}{辛迪安和猎人相处得怎么样？他不再和我们在一起了吗？}
#{1250}{}{I guess so... In addition, it put us in a certain light, but father could deal with that. His dedication and resolute acting meant people did not consider him or me traitors. I think the greatest impact this situation had on father was overwhelming disappointment. He had envisioned a great future for Sindian in the army and in the imperial council. He had always been so proud of him and all of a sudden he threw it all away and acted directly against his father's conviction.}
{1250}{}{我想是的。。。此外，这让我们有了某种认识，但父亲可以应付。他的献身精神和坚定的行动意味着人们不认为他或我是叛徒。我认为这种情况对父亲最大的影响是极度的失望。他曾设想过辛甸人在军队和朝廷的美好未来。他一直为自己感到骄傲，突然之间，他把这一切抛诸脑后，直接违背了父亲的信念。}

They tried to get help in the hospital in the Dead Quarter, but they died there. And none of the Hunters wanted to tell me anything about Sindian. When I mentioned his name, they acted very hostile, I mean, more than usually.}

#{1400}{}{Sindian always chooses the greatest of challenges and faces them full of enthusiasm. He fights for what he believes in and he will not stop until he succeeds. He is simply headstrong, just like his father was. They could argue for hours when there was something they did not agree on. It used to happen. The fact is, father was the one who made Sindian the way he is. He enrolled him in the army at the lowest possible age, he continuously encouraged his ambition and tried to imprint on him devotion to the empire. He was exactly the same towards me, with the exception of the army, but there is no doubt he put more of his effort into Sindian.}
{1400}{}{辛典总是选择最大的挑战，充满热情地面对它们。他为自己的信仰而战，不成功他是不会罢休的。他很任性，就像他父亲一样。当他们有不一致的意见时，他们可以争论好几个小时。以前是这样的。事实上，是父亲创造了辛迪安现在的样子。他在尽可能低的年龄就让他参军，他不断鼓励自己的雄心壮志，并试图在自己身上留下对帝国的忠诚。除了军队之外，他对我的态度完全一样，但毫无疑问，他把更多的精力放在了辛迪安身上。}

I can defend myself quite effectively, but combat simply is not where I feel most comfortable. I've tried to find support, someone who would accompany me.

{1453}{}{告诉我更多关于你哥哥的事。}
#{1454}{}{Can I ask you about your mother? Is she still alive?}
{1454}{}{我能问你关于你妈妈的事吗？她还活着吗？}
#{1455}{}{I've got to go. If I happen to run into Sindian out there, I'll tell him you're looking for him.}
{1455}{}{我得走了。如果我碰巧在外面碰到辛迪安，我会告诉他你在找他。}
#{1500}{}{I'm a physician. I've had the best teacher possible, my father. He was an extraordinary practicioner of medicine, a true professional. My vocation is to save lives, not to take them.}
{1500}{}{我是医生。我有最好的老师，我父亲。他是一位非凡的医学实践者，一位真正的专业人士。我的使命是拯救生命，而不是夺走他们。}
#{1501}{}{Do you want to travel with me? I'm trying to find certain answers myself. We can help each other. [Tell her your story.]}
{1501}{}{你想和我一起旅行吗？我自己也在努力寻找答案。我们可以互相帮助。[告诉她你的故事。]}
#{1502}{}{Tell me more about your brother.}
{1502}{}{告诉我更多关于你哥哥的事。}
#{1503}{}{Can I ask you about your mother? Is she still alive?}
{1503}{}{我能问你关于你妈妈的事吗？她还活着吗？}
#{1504}{}{I think we could travel together. Do you still share this opinion?}
{1504}{}{我想我们可以一起旅行。你还同意这个观点吗？}
#{1505}{}{I've got to go. If I happen to run into Sindian out there, I'll tell him you're looking for him.}
{1505}{}{我得走了。如果我碰巧在外面碰到辛迪安，我会告诉他你在找他。}
#{1550}{}{You're trying to seek out your past despite the fact they are trying to kill you? No... [She doesn't let you answer.] Without regard to your danger during your search, it's undoubtedly the only means of stopping the attacks on your person once and for all. And you're clearly driven by an insistent curiosity. Am I right? In a way, you remind me of my brother.}
{1550}{}{你想找出你的过去，尽管他们想杀了你？不。。。[她不让你回答。]不管你在搜查过程中有多危险，这无疑是彻底阻止袭击你的人的唯一手段。你显然是被一种强烈的好奇心驱使着。我说得对吗？在某种程度上，你让我想起了我的哥哥。}
#{1551}{}{You used to be a ghoul? Your story is so unbelievable that you cannot possibly have simply made it up. You want to stop the Rebirth. Exactly as my brother always wanted to. Based on your words, it presents an even greater threat than everybody believes.}
{1551}{}{你以前是僵尸？你的故事太不可思议了，你不可能只是编出来的。你想阻止重生。就像我哥哥一直想的那样。根据你的话，这是一个比大家都相信的更大的威胁。}
#{1552}{}{You used to be a ghoul? Your story is so unbelievable that you cannot possibly have simply made it up. You want to stop the Rebirth. Exactly as my brother always wanted to. Based on your words, it presents an even greater threat than everybody believes.}
{1552}{}{你以前是僵尸？你的故事太不可思议了，你不可能只是编出来的。你想阻止重生。就像我哥哥一直想的那样。根据你的话，这是一个比大家都相信的更大的威胁。}
#{1553}{}{Does that mean you'll join me?}
{1553}{}{那意味着你要加入我吗？}
#{1600}{}{I admit I haven't considered seeking help outside the City, even though it was clear to me I would not find any within the empire. Help me find my brother and I will do everything that is in my power to help you. I only ask one thing. Please, do not postpone the search for Sindian too much. It has been too long already since he has left Albuquerque. It will not be simple to locate him.}
{1600}{}{我承认我没有考虑过在城外寻求帮助，尽管我很清楚在帝国内部找不到任何帮助。帮我找到我弟弟，我会尽我所能帮助你。我只问一件事。求求你，不要把寻找辛迪安的时间推迟太多。他离开阿尔伯克基已经太久了。找到他可不容易。}
#{1601}{}{Are you ready to depart?}
{1601}{}{你准备好出发了吗？}
#{1602}{}{Tell me more about your brother first.}
{1602}{}{先告诉我更多关于你哥哥的事。}
#{1603}{}{Can I ask you about your mother? Is she still alive?}
{1603}{}{我能问你关于你妈妈的事吗？她还活着吗？}
#{1604}{}{Maybe later, I will think about it.}
{1604}{}{也许以后，我会考虑的。}
#{1650}{}{Yes, I've had my personal effects prepared for some time now. I will go get them and prepare myself. Can you wait for a moment, please?}
{1650}{}{是的，我已经准备了一段时间的私人物品了。我去拿他们，自己准备。你能等一下吗？}
#{1651}{}{[Wait.]}
{1651}{}{[等等。]}
#{1700}{}{[It took almost an hour for Lystra to return armed and dressed in imperial armor.] In the past few days I've been trying to locate someone in the Suburbs with any kind of knowledge regarding my brother. I've succeeded in finding out about a man who allowed him to join his caravan. The caravan is expected to arrive in Albuquerque today. We should go see him soon, before he departs again, and ask him about Sindian.}
{1700}{}{在过去的几天里，我一直试图在郊区找到一个对我兄弟有任何了解的人。我成功地找到了一个允许他加入商队的人。车队预计今天抵达阿尔伯克基。我们应该很快去见他，在他再次离开之前，问问他辛迪安的情况。}
#{1701}{}{Good, that might give us a clue.}
{1701}{}{很好，这可能会给我们一个线索。}
#{1750}{}{The truth is I did not want to depart on my own. However, that does not mean I'm willing to join a party this large. I'd be willing to join you, but it seems you have no space for me.}
{1750}{}{事实是我不想独自离开。然而，这并不意味着我愿意加入这么大的一个政党。我很愿意和你一起去，但你好像没有地方给我了。}
#{1751}{}{Fine, tell me more about your brother instead.}
{1751}{}{好吧，告诉我更多关于你哥哥的事。}
#{1752}{}{Can I ask you about your mother? Is she still alive?}
{1752}{}{我能问你关于你妈妈的事吗？她还活着吗？}
#{1753}{}{As you think. Bye.}
{1753}{}{如你所想。再见。}
#{1800}{}{Your offer sounds interesting, but I don't trust you. I've met my share of people outside the City and you strike me as just the kind of person I can never be certain about when you will try to rob or kill me. I'm sorry. My conclusion about you might be incorrect, but I would not feel comfortable traveling with you.}
{1800}{}{你的提议听起来很有趣，但我不相信你。我见过城外的人，你对我的印象是，我永远无法确定你什么时候会抢劫或杀害我。我很抱歉。我对你的结论可能不正确，但和你一起旅行我会感到不舒服。}
#{1801}{}{Fine, tell me more about your brother instead.}
{1801}{}{好吧，告诉我更多关于你哥哥的事。}
#{1802}{}{Can I ask you about your mother? Is she still alive?}
{1802}{}{我能问你关于你妈妈的事吗？她还活着吗？}
#{1803}{}{As you think. Bye.}
{1803}{}{如你所想。再见。}
#{1850}{}{No, she's not. She died soon after I was born. Postpartum complications of such nature even my father was unable to deal with them. Afterwards, he raised me and my brother on his own. More specifically, he tried to instill us with the ability to take care of ourselves. The rest was provided by the empire.}
{1850}{}{不，她不是。我出生不久她就死了。这种性质的产后并发症连我父亲都无法处理。后来，他独自抚养我和我弟弟。更具体地说，他试图灌输我们照顾自己的能力。其余的由帝国提供。}
#{1851}{}{Why isn't Sindian in Albuquerque?}
{1851}{}{为什么辛迪安不在阿尔伯克基？}
#{1852}{}{Tell me more about your brother.}
{1852}{}{告诉我更多关于你哥哥的事。}
#{1853}{}{Why didn't you set out to look for your brother?}
{1853}{}{你为什么不去找你哥哥？}
#{1854}{}{You mentioned you're not very skilled in battle. What can you do?}
{1854}{}{你说过你不擅长战斗。你能做什么？}
#{1855}{}{If you want to find your brother, why don't you join me? I'm trying to find certain answers myself. We can help each other. [Tell her your story.]}
{1855}{}{如果你想找到你哥哥，为什么不和我一起去？我自己也在努力寻找答案。我们可以互相帮助。[告诉她你的故事。]}
#{1856}{}{I think we could travel together. Do you still share this opinion?}
{1856}{}{我想我们可以一起旅行。你还同意这个观点吗？}
#{1857}{}{I've got to go. If I happen to run into him out there, I'll tell him you're looking for him.}
{1857}{}{我得走了。如果我碰巧在外面碰到他，我会告诉他你在找他。}
#{1900}{}{I've been assured both offices are waiting for me. Emperor Aran wants to restore the council, even though it will not immediately be in the full capacity of three advisors. That will make it all the more demanding on me. At least we have dealt with the threat of Anonym. I wish the toll had not been so high.}
{1900}{}{我确信两个办公室都在等我。天皇阿兰希望恢复议会，尽管它不会立即在三个顾问的全部能力。那对我来说就更苛刻了。至少我们已经处理了匿名的威胁。但愿过路费没有这么高。}
#{1901}{}{You're right. Given the horrible experience from the past, Empress Elisa has decided to disband the council, at least temporarily. I believe I would have been the only member, anyway. There are no other family members viable for this office at the moment. I'm convinced the role of a hospital director that is waiting for me will occupy me more than sufficiently.}
{1901}{}{你说得对。鉴于过去的可怕经历，埃莉莎皇后决定解散安理会，至少暂时解散。我相信我会是唯一的成员，无论如何。目前没有其他家庭成员能胜任这个职位。我相信一个医院院长的角色在等着我，这个角色将占据我足够的时间。}
#{1902}{}{So I should address you as "your imperial majesty."}
{1902}{}{所以我应该称呼你为“陛下”}
#{1903}{}{So I should address you as "your imperial majesty."}
{1903}{}{所以我应该称呼你为“陛下”}
#{1904}{}{When are you going to take up these functions?}
{1904}{}{你打算什么时候担任这些职务？}
#{1905}{}{Are you the only descendant of your father here? Are there any others?}
{1905}{}{你是你父亲的唯一后裔吗？还有其他的吗？}
#{1906}{}{What happened to your brother?}
{1906}{}{你弟弟怎么了？}
#{1907}{}{It was a pleasure meeting you but I have to go.}
{1907}{}{很高兴见到你，但我得走了。}
#{1908}{}{It was a pleasure meeting you but I have to go.}
{1908}{}{很高兴见到你，但我得走了。}
#{1950}{}{Oh, hello. You're welcome to spend some time here, if you want. I have no doubt it's much more peaceful in here than in the main court or even outside. Maybe too peaceful. I would be glad to talk to you again.}
{1950}{}{哦，你好。如果你愿意的话，欢迎你在这里呆一段时间。我毫不怀疑，这里比主球场甚至外面都要安静得多。也许太平静了。我很高兴再和你谈谈。}
#{1951}{}{I've just realized I should address you as "your imperial majesty."}
{1951}{}{我刚意识到我应该称呼你“陛下”}
#{1952}{}{I've just realized I should address you as "your imperial majesty."}
{1952}{}{我刚意识到我应该称呼你“陛下”}
#{1953}{}{When are you going to take up your father's duties?}
{1953}{}{你打算什么时候接替你父亲的职务？}
#{1954}{}{You've mentioned you're the only descendant of Beldir here? Are there any others?}
{1954}{}{你说过你是这里唯一的贝尔迪尔后裔？还有其他的吗？}
#{1955}{}{So tell me what happened to your brother.}
{1955}{}{告诉我你哥哥怎么了。}
#{1956}{}{Why isn't your brother Sindian in Albuquerque?}
{1956}{}{为什么你弟弟辛迪安不在阿尔伯克基？}
#{1957}{}{Tell me more about your brother.}
{1957}{}{告诉我更多关于你哥哥的事。}
#{1958}{}{Can I ask you about your mother? Is she still alive?}
{1958}{}{我能问你关于你妈妈的事吗？她还活着吗？}
#{1959}{}{Why didn't you set out to look for your brother?}
{1959}{}{你为什么不去找你哥哥？}
#{1960}{}{I remember you mentioned combat is not something you feel at home with. What can you do?}
{1960}{}{我记得你说过战斗不是一件让你感到自在的事。你能做什么？}
#{1961}{}{You want to find your brother. Why don't you join me? I'm trying to find certain answers myself. We can help each other. [Tell her your story.]}
{1961}{}{你想找到你哥哥。你为什么不和我一起去？我自己也在努力寻找答案。我们可以互相帮助。[告诉她你的故事。]}
#{1962}{}{I think we could travel together. Do you still share this opinion?}
{1962}{}{我想我们可以一起旅行。你还同意这个观点吗？}
#{1963}{}{I have to go, sorry.}
{1963}{}{我得走了，对不起。}
#{1964}{}{Uff.}
{1964}{}{不明飞行物。}
#{2000}{}{[She sighs joylessly.] I'm in no mood for foolish jokes that people in the wastes might consider funny. I'm sure you have come to the City for a particular reason, otherwise you would not have been allowed to enter. Take care of your duties, I'm positive I'm not the person you're looking for. Good-bye. [She stops noticing you.]}
{2000}{}{[她高兴地叹了口气]我没心情听那些荒野里的人可能会认为有趣的愚蠢笑话。我相信你来这座城市是有特殊原因的，否则你是不被允许进入的。照顾好你的职责，我肯定我不是你要找的人。再见。[她不再注意你。]}
#{2001}{}{Ugh.}
{2001}{}{啊。}
#{2050}{}{[She sighs joylessly.] Is that you again? I've already told you I'm not interested in talking to you. Please, leave me alone. [She stops noticing you.]}
{2050}{}{[她高兴地叹了口气]又是你吗？我已经告诉过你我不想和你说话了。拜托，别烦我。[她不再注意你。]}
#{2051}{}{Ugh.}
{2051}{}{啊。}
#{2100}{}{Your offer sounds interesting, but... [She sighs.] You're a Mutant Hunter. This is not about what people here in the empire would say if I joined a Hunter. I don't care about that. Frankly ?? I simply cannot trust you sufficiently to set out on a journey with you and feel comfortable. You might be a good person, but I do not trust your superiors and I don't know what you're willing to do once an order has been given. In fact, I do not even know what my brother did that made him abscond. It could be something you would not like.}
{2100}{}{你的提议听起来很有趣，但是。。。[她叹了口气]你是个变种猎人。如果我加入一个猎人，帝国里的人不会这么说。我才不管呢。坦白地说，我根本不能完全信任你，让你和你一起踏上旅途，感到舒适。你可能是个好人，但我不相信你的上级，我也不知道一旦下了命令你愿意做什么。事实上，我甚至不知道我哥哥做了什么使他潜逃。可能是你不喜欢的。}
