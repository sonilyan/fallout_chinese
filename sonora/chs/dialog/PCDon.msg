{103}{}{你在威胁我吗？}

#Acquaintance
### {200}{}{To break into me so brazenly, you need balls of steel. Who are you? What do you need?}
{200}{}{要如此厚颜无耻地闯入我，你需要铁球。你是谁？你需要什么？}
### {1200}{}{To break into me so brazenly, you need nerves of steel. Who are you? What do you need?}
{1200}{}{要如此厚颜无耻地闯入我，你需要钢铁般的勇气。你是谁？你需要什么？}
### {201}{}{I }
{201}{}{我}
### {202}{}{ from the Villa. And I want to work for you, Don Diego.}
{202}{}{别墅。我想为你工作，唐・迭戈。}
### {203}{}{Many say the same thing, and then run away at the slightest hint of responsibility. You see, this casino is not just a place for me to earn money. It's a family. I need serious reasons to accept the first person I meet into it.}
{203}{}{许多人都说同样的话，然后一点责任感就跑了。你看，这个赌场不仅仅是我赚钱的地方。这是一个家庭。我需要认真的理由来接受我遇到的第一个人。}
### {204}{}{If you need a foundation, I'll find something to strengthen it. See you later, Don Diego.}
{204}{}{如果你需要一个基础，我会找到一些东西来加强它。回头见，圣地亚哥。}
### {205}{}{Bill warned me about your arrival. Who are you? What do you need?}
{205}{}{比尔提醒我你到了。你是谁？你需要什么？}
### {206}{}{Don Diego, listen to me. The community I came from fell victim to the slavers. I'm trying to get it back the way it was.}
{206}{}{圣地亚哥，听我说，我所在的社区成了奴隶贩子的牺牲品。我正在努力恢复原状。}
### {207}{}{So why don't you ask Aaron himself for help? As far as I know, it is his cult that supplies caps to slavers in various colonies. I can't and don't want to help you.}
{207}{}{那你为什么不向亚伦本人寻求帮助呢？据我所知，正是他的崇拜为各个殖民地的奴隶主提供了瓶盖。我不能也不想帮助你。}
### {208}{}{Sorry to hear that. Goodbye, Don Diego.}
{208}{}{很抱歉听到这个消息。再见，唐・迭戈。}
### {209}{}{Curious. Are you asking for my help?}
{209}{}{好奇的你在请求我的帮助吗？}
### {210}{}{Rather, I offer cooperation. It seems that we have a common enemy - the fire worshippers.}
{210}{}{相反，我提供合作。我们似乎有一个共同的敌人――拜火教徒。}
### {211}{}{You're talking about a simple business. As I said, this casino is a family for me, not just a business. I don't want to put myself and my "relatives" at risk in a direct fight against sectarians and act as an aggressor at the same time. But Aaron's pressure is getting stronger, and someday I will have to take drastic measures.}
{211}{}{你说的是一件简单的事。正如我所说，这家赌场对我来说是一个家庭，而不仅仅是一家企业。我不想让自己和我的“亲戚”在与宗派主义者的直接斗争中处于危险之中，同时又充当侵略者。但亚伦的压力越来越大，总有一天我将不得不采取严厉的措施。}
### {212}{}{I'm sorry to hear that. Goodbye, Don Diego.}
{212}{}{听到这个消息我很难过。再见，唐・迭戈。}
### {213}{}{Give me a chance. You won't regret it.}
{213}{}{给我一个机会。你不会后悔的。}
### {214}{}{I'm not asking for help. I ask for justice, Don Diego.}
{214}{}{我不是在寻求帮助。我请求正义，圣地亚哥。}
### {215}{}{You know, once I was just like you, an ordinary peasant. I was digging in the dirt, doing mouse scuffling in an old barn. It took a lot of effort to get out of that hole and strengthen in the city.}
{215}{}{你知道，曾经我和你一样，是一个普通的农民。我在泥土里挖，在一个旧谷仓里抓老鼠。为了走出这个洞并加强城市的实力，我们付出了很多努力。}
### {216}{}{I'm glad you understand me.}
{216}{}{我很高兴你能理解我。}
### {217}{}{That's just a lot of time has passed since then. I like you. But I need serious reasons to trust you.}
{217}{}{从那时起，时间已经过去了很多。我喜欢你。但我需要认真的理由来信任你。}
### {218}{}{Check me out in the case. I will prove that your distrust is in vain.}
{218}{}{看看我的案子。我会证明你的不信任是徒劳的。}
### {219}{}{I'm sorry to hear that. Farewell, Don Diego.}
{219}{}{听到这个消息我很难过。再见了，唐・迭戈。}
### {220}{}{Talk to Garcia. He'll give you a couple of simple tasks to start with. Let's see how you do.}
{220}{}{和加西亚谈谈。他会给你一些简单的任务。让我们看看你做得怎么样。}
### {221}{}{I will not disappoint you, Don Diego.}
{221}{}{我不会让你失望的，圣地亚哥。}
### {222}{}{Okay. As you say.}
{222}{}{可以正如你所说。}
### {223}{}{Unfortunately, I don't have a job for you right now.}
{223}{}{不幸的是，我现在没有工作给你。}
### {224}{}{I'm sorry to hear that.}
{224}{}{听到这个消息我很难过。}

### {250}{}{What do you want?}
{250}{}{你想要什么？}
### {251}{}{What will you tell me?}
{251}{}{你会告诉我什么？}
### {252}{}{Did something happen?}
{252}{}{发生什么事了吗？}
### {253}{}{My respects, Don Diego.}
{253}{}{我的敬意，唐・迭戈。}

### {260}{}{Don Diego, I wonder what you intend to do now that the cathedral has been destroyed?}
{260}{}{堂，我想知道大教堂被毁了，你打算怎么办？}
### {261}{}{You allow yourself questions not on the status.}
{261}{}{你允许自己提问，而不是关于状态。}
### {262}{}{I'm sorry, Don Diego.}
{262}{}{对不起，唐・迭戈。}
### {263}{}{Okay, I'm just wondering.}
{263}{}{好吧，我只是想知道。}
### {264}{}{The same as before. Earn, expand your influence. It's easier to do this now than ever.}
{264}{}{和以前一样。赚钱，扩大你的影响力。现在做这件事比以往任何时候都容易。}
### {265}{}{The Cult of Fire interfered with you, didn't it?}
{265}{}{火教干扰了你，不是吗？}
### {266}{}{The departure of fire worshippers from the Phoenix stage opens up good vacancies, but at the same time it is a blow to many areas of activity in the city. Without the cathedral, it will be difficult to maintain the exchange rate of the cap currency, some caravans will lose their jobs, some people are already fleeing the city. What to say about the increased crime. In such conditions, you have to reconsider your entire business. But yes, it's just to my advantage.}
{266}{}{拜火教徒离开凤凰城舞台带来了很好的空缺，但同时也对城市的许多活动领域造成了打击。如果没有大教堂，将很难维持上限货币的汇率，一些大篷车将失去工作，一些人已经逃离了这座城市。关于犯罪率的上升该怎么说。在这种情况下，你必须重新考虑你的整个业务。但是的，这对我有利。}
### {267}{}{Thank you for your answer, Don Diego.}
{267}{}{谢谢你的回答，唐・迭戈。}

#Attack on Followers
### {300}{}{I'm investigating an attack on monks. What do you know about it?}
{300}{}{我正在调查一起针对僧侣的袭击事件。你对此了解多少？}
### {301}{}{I won't let you barge in on me with an interrogation. Security, throw this persistent man out of the casino.}
{301}{}{我不会让你审问我的。保安，把这个固执的人赶出赌场。}
### {302}{}{Just touch it!}
{302}{}{只要碰一下！}
### {303}{}{OK, I'll leave.}
{303}{}{好的，我走。}
### {304}{}{Breaking in with an interrogation has become the norm for Followers? Okay, I'll answer out of respect for the church that feeds the city.}
{304}{}{闯入审讯已经成为追随者们的常态？好吧，我会出于对为城市提供食物的教堂的尊重而回答。}
### {305}{}{Great, let me open the notebook... Here we go.}
{305}{}{太好了，让我打开笔记本...我们开始吧。}
### {306}{}{Ya. Nothing. I don't know.}
{306}{}{是的。没有什么我不知道。}
### {307}{}{Uh, what?}
{307}{}{什么？}
### {308}{}{Someone surrounded the monks on the street and shot them at point-blank range. I wasn't there, there are different rumors, my people assure me that they are not in business. I have nothing more to say.}
{308}{}{有人包围了街上的僧侣，并在近距离射杀了他们。我不在那里，有不同的传言，我的人向我保证他们不在做生意。我没有什么好说的了。}
### {309}{}{Oh, sorry, Don Diego. Now I see that I'm wasting your time.}
{309}{}{哦，对不起，唐・迭戈。现在我发现我在浪费你的时间。}
### {310}{}{Success in the investigation. And don't bother me about this case anymore.}
{310}{}{调查成功。别再为这个案子烦我了。}
### {311}{}{Goodbye.}
{311}{}{再见}
### {312}{}{And what alibi do you and your subordinates have?}
{312}{}{你和你的下属有什么不在场证明？}
### {313}{}{What the fuck is an alibi? Our casino owes a debt to the Sacred Fire Church for what it has done for the city. The church regulates the turnover of caps and gives people jobs. It makes no sense for us to chop down the brahmin we are milking, do you understand that? Moreover, it is so open and at its own doors.}
{313}{}{他妈的不在场证明是什么？我们的赌场欠拜火教堂一笔债，因为它为城市所做的一切。教会管理上限的更替，并为人们提供工作。我们砍下正在挤奶的婆罗门是没有意义的，你明白吗？此外，它是如此的开放和敞开自己的大门。}
### {314}{}{Hmm, nevertheless it looks doubtful. I'll leave, but I'll still take you on a pencil.}
{314}{}{嗯，不过这看起来很可疑。我会离开的，但我还是会带你去的。}
### {315}{}{I understand now. Have a nice day.}
{315}{}{我现在明白了。祝你今天愉快。}
### {316}{}{Come on, Don Diego, let's talk informally.}
{316}{}{来吧，唐・迭戈，让我们非正式地谈谈。}
### {317}{}{Hey, Garcia, what is this peasant carrying? Do you think he can talk to me on equal terms? This man is definitely stupid. Throw him out on the street.}
{317}{}{嘿，加西亚，这个农民拿着什么？你认为他能和我平等交谈吗？这个人真是愚蠢。把他扔到街上。}
### {1317}{}{Hey, Garcia, what is this peasant woman carrying? Does she think she can talk to me on equal terms? This woman is definitely not herself. Throw her out on the street.}
{1317}{}{嘿，加西亚，这个农妇拿着什么？她认为她能和我平等交谈吗？这个女人绝对不是她自己。把她扔到街上。}
### {318}{}{Then remember, young adept of a dubious cult, that in this city many have a grudge against Followers.}
{318}{}{请记住，一个年轻的、擅长可疑邪教的人，在这个城市里，许多人对追随者怀恨在心。}
### {319}{}{Why is that?}
{319}{}{为什么？}
### {320}{}{First, the revolution that brought Aaron to power. And then the mass inquisition, arranged by this ruler to strengthen power. People do not soon forget this. The ones you're looking for are well organized and equipped with good weapons. They do not spare bullets and are not afraid to go against the authorities. These are not simple robbers or mercenaries.}
{320}{}{首先，亚伦掌权的革命。然后是大规模的调查，由这位统治者安排来加强权力。人们不会很快忘记这一点。你要找的人组织严密，装备精良。他们不放过子弹，也不怕与当局作对。这些不是简单的强盗或雇佣兵。}
### {321}{}{A reasonable remark. I should think about it.}
{321}{}{一句合理的话。我应该好好想想。}
### {322}{}{Well organized and armed. Just like your casino... No, no, I'm not accusing you of anything. Farewell, Don Diego.}
{322}{}{组织严密，武装精良。就像你的赌场一样...不，不，我没有指责你。再见了，唐・迭戈。}
