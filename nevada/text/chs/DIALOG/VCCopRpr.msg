#{100}{}{You see Curtis.}
{100}{}{你看柯蒂斯。}
#{101}{}{You see a mechanic with a wrench in his hand. He has quite a puzzled look.}
{101}{}{你看到一个机械师手里拿着扳手。他一脸困惑。}
#{110}{}{What do you want, pal?}
{110}{}{你想要什么，伙计？}
#{111}{}{I'm just stopping by, to see how fellow hard worker is doing.}
{111}{}{我只是顺道过来看看同事们干得怎么样。}
#{112}{}{Nothing.}
{112}{}{没有什么。}
#{113}{}{"Fellow hard worker"? Heh! Bad, as always. Do you see this big guy on the floor?}
{113}{}{“努力的同事”？嘿！坏的，一如既往。你看见地板上有个大个子吗？}
#{114}{}{Robo-cop? Funny...}
{114}{}{机器人警察？好笑。。。}
#{115}{}{Yeah, it is. So many complicated stuff to fix just so he could stand somewhere for intimidation. I'd have better luck wearing this junk on me and scaring the passersby myself.}
{115}{}{是的，是的。这么多复杂的事情要处理，只是为了让他站在某个地方受到恐吓。我穿上这件破烂衣服，自己吓唬路人，运气会好一些。}
#{116}{}{Do you think there would be no benefit from it?}
{116}{}{你认为这样做没有好处吗？}
#{117}{}{Well, with full ammunition and in normal condition, he is, of course, a real death machine. Perhaps, the chief could use it in special operations. But in general, this piece of hardware is designed to intimidate with its look.}
{117}{}{好吧，在正常情况下，弹药充足，他当然是一个真正的死亡机器。也许，酋长可以在特别行动中使用它。但总的来说，这件硬件的设计是为了用它的外观来吓唬人。}
#{118}{}{Do you think he would be dangerous, after the activation?}
{118}{}{你认为激活后他会很危险吗？}
#{119}{}{Who knows... The military model was not created for peaceful purposes, baby. They were made to KILL! And this robot is lied dormant for, like, 70 years, with no check-ups. Luckily, I came up with taking away his ammunition and disabling lower servomotors, to avoid being killed on the spot when he'll be turned on. But it's the other thing that scares me - not many people can understand this level of robotic tech. So, no one could really tell what's on the mind of this piece of iron. We have to rely on testing and spend a lot of time to study the blueprints. So much effort for one robot! Is it worth it? I'm not sure.}
{119}{}{谁知道。。。军事模型不是为了和平目的而建立的，宝贝。他们是被杀的！这个机器人休眠了，大概70年，没有检查。幸运的是，我想出了拿走他的弹药和禁用较低的伺服电机，以避免被当场杀死时，他将被打开。但另一件事让我害怕的是，没有多少人能理解这种机器人技术的水平，所以，没有人能真正说出这块铁的想法。我们必须依靠测试，并花费大量时间研究蓝图。为一个机器人付出了这么多的努力！值得吗？我不确定。}
#{120}{}{Does he has any imperfections?}
{120}{}{他有什么缺点吗？}
#{121}{}{Of course he has! It's full of electronics. One shot of pulse round - and the circuits will simply fry. It's a common problem for all pre-war build robots.}
{121}{}{他当然有！里面全是电子产品。一次脉冲循环-电路就会完全崩溃。这是所有战前建造的机器人的共同问题。}
#{122}{}{Pulse weapons? And where can one find it?}
{122}{}{脉冲武器？在哪里可以找到它？}
#{123}{}{I suppose, only in some military depots, or in places that are associated with the old army. These things had not been released for civilian market.}
{123}{}{我想，只有在一些军事基地，或在与旧军队有关的地方。这些东西还没有投放到民用市场。}
#{128}{}{Fine craft. Well, I should go, bye.}
{128}{}{工艺精湛。好吧，我该走了，再见。}
#{129}{}{Yeah, see you.}
{129}{}{是的，再见。}
#{130}{}{Good luck.}
{130}{}{祝你好运。}
#{131}{}{Can you help in repair?}
{131}{}{你能帮忙修理吗？}
#{132}{}{Listen, I work for the police. The cops won't let me do the work for outsiders, so - sorry, I don't want to lose my job here. I can only recommend a good mechanic at Hoover dam. But he specializes mainly on electronics.}
{132}{}{听着，我为警察工作。警察不让我为外人做事，所以-对不起，我不想失去我在这里的工作。我只能在胡佛大坝推荐一个好的机械师。但他主要研究电子技术。}
#{133}{}{Okay. Well I won't bother you then.}
{133}{}{可以。那我就不打扰你了。}
#{150}{}{Hello!}
{150}{}{你好！}
#{151}{}{Hey!}
{151}{}{嘿！}
#{152}{}{Oh, it's you...}
{152}{}{哦，是你。。。}
#{153}{}{Sorry, I'm working...}
{153}{}{对不起，我在工作。。。}
#{154}{}{What? It's time for break?}
{154}{}{什么？休息时间到了？}
#{230}{}{Have you seen the car not far from here? My ride. Jealous?}
{230}{}{你看到离这儿不远的那辆车了吗？我的车。嫉妒？}
#{231}{}{[Whistles] I would be honored to even touch it! Out of professional interest and technological engagement, so to speak. And you know, if the car is working, then maybe I can hook her up with something - gravity-plates with energocyclic chip! The car won't just ride, it will FLY! Well, figuratively speaking.}
{231}{}{我很荣幸能碰它！可以说是出于专业兴趣和技术参与。你知道，如果车能用的话，也许我可以给她买些东西-重力板和能量芯片！这辆车不仅能开，还能飞！好吧，打个比方。}
#{232}{}{And do you have this... Thing?}
{232}{}{你有这个。。。事情？}
#{233}{}{Yeah, it's waiting for its new owner. Of course, I wouldn't mind of payment for my work. The price is 2500, deal?}
{233}{}{是的，它在等它的新主人。当然，我不介意我的工作报酬。价格是2500，成交吗？}
#{234}{}{Okay, here is the money.}
{234}{}{好的，这是钱。}
#{235}{}{I don't have cash right now. I'll come back later.}
{235}{}{我现在没有现金。我一会儿回来。}
#{236}{}{Then wait for a few hours. I will do everything and come back.}
{236}{}{然后等几个小时。我会尽一切努力回来的。}
#{237}{}{Okay.}
{237}{}{可以。}
#{238}{}{All done! You can now go on ahead and try it out... Damn, I'm so jealous!}
{238}{}{一切就绪！你现在可以继续尝试了。。。妈的，我好嫉妒！}
#{239}{}{Oh. Thanks.}
{239}{}{哦。谢谢。}
#{240}{}{After installing the gravity-plates your car can accelerate to incredible speeds and consume far less energy. Highways of Nevada, tremble!}
{240}{}{安装重力板后，你的车可以加速到难以置信的速度，消耗更少的能源。内华达州的高速公路，颤抖！}
#{1110}{}{And what do you want, gal?}
{1110}{}{你想要什么，姑娘？}
#{1111}{}{I'm just stopping by, to see how the fellow hard worker is doing.}
{1111}{}{我只是顺便来看看这位辛勤工作的同事怎么样。}
