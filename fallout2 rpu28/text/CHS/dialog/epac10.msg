#{243}{}{Uh, not exactly. I'm sure you're a perfectly normal guy that was kept frozen for perfectly normal, non-evil reasons. Hell, what do I know?

#{250}{}{[Dex takes another look around the room and whistles.] This place has really gone to shit. How long did you say it's been?[德克斯又看了看房间，然后悄声说道]这个地方就是一沱屎。你刚刚说有多久了？}
#{251}{}{It's been over a hundred and fifty years since the Great Silence brought an end to the Old Ones... *your* people.自从大寂静给“你的”旧世界画上句号，已经150年了...}

#{260}{}{Great Silence? The Old Ones? How about you spare me this cryptic bullshit and just tell me what happened?大寂静？旧世界？你干嘛停住这些废话，直接告诉我发生啥了？}
#{261}{}{The Great Silence is what my people call the end of your world. When the great fires rained down from the sky and scorched the land. You'll find the world is nothing like the one you knew.大寂静就是我们这些人称呼你的世界终点的词。当业火从天而降，席卷大地，你就发现这儿世界和你所熟悉的完全不一样了}

{260}{}{大寂静？旧世界？你别跟我胡扯了，直接告诉我发生了什么事。}
{261}{}{大寂静，嗯，它的意思，直接点说就是属于你那个年代的世界已经终结了。当火焰像雨点一样从天而降之后，这个世界已经变了样了。}


#{270}{}{No shit, so they actually dropped the bombs, huh? I guess the vault project wasn't just a big waste of the tax-payers' money, after all.放屁，就是说他们真的丢了炸弹，嗯？避难所计划到最后并不是完全浪费纳税人的钱嘛。}
#{271}{}{Wait. You know of the holy vaults?等等。你听说过神圣避难所？}

#{280}{}{Know of them? Hell, I used to live right by the Chicago vault. I even watched 'em finish building the thing. Then of course they started doing those damn drills...

{281}{}{告诉我更多避难所的事！}
{282}{}{这么说吧，我被我的族人选出来找寻避难所。在那里我希望能回收一个伊甸园创造器，然后用它的力量拯救我的村子。所以你告诉我的任何东西对我的任务都很有用。}

#{294}{}{I don't think I'm too eager to go gallivanting around the wasteland with a psychotic murderer. So you're on your own, "bud". Don't worry, I'm sure you'll be just fine. [Snicker.]我觉得我一点都不想跟一个疯狂杀手在废土上闲逛。现在你靠你自己了，“伙计”。别担心，我觉得你会很好的。}

{290}{}{我会告诉你的。这么说吧，老兄。你需要有人帮忙找到这些避难所，而我需要在你这个疯狂的世界里面有个人给我系上安全带。所以，我们一起合作，你觉得如何，“拍档”？}
{291}{}{嗯，你对旧世界的了解应该会对我很有用...。但是，在那台电脑里我读过你的信息。我认为你不是我想一起旅行的人。}

#{320}{}{Alright, you see, it's all part of their "experiments". These crazy fucking doctors were doing some kind of tests on the "nature of human evil" or some crap.

At least, that's the best I could figure it.好的，你看，这就是他们的“实验”。这些疯狂博士在测试一些“人性本恶”或者其他什么狗屎。他们给我注射了一个疯子的记忆，来测试这种记忆如何影响普通人的人性。至少，最多能指出这些。}

#{330}{}{Heh, you see that's the funny thing. *I* actually came to *them*. Answered an ad they put out saying they'd pay big bucks for healthy test subjects.

He sighs deeply and wipes the tears away.] Anyway, thanks to you, bud, I'm finally free of that nightmare.嗨，你看到那个搞笑玩意儿了嘛？“我”就是为“他们”来的。我打了他们登出来的广告电话，广告说他们会给健康的测试对象付一大笔钱。我要这笔钱，嗯。很明显我这辈子最严重的错误。我甚至不能给你说他们给我注射的恐怖。[他眼角反射着泪光。他长叹一口气，抹去泪水]无论如何，谢谢你，老兄。我最终从这个噩梦中自由了。}

{320}{}{好吧，你看，这都是他们“实验”的一部分。这些科学狂人在做一些关于“人性本恶”的测试或者一些其它什么类似的垃圾实验。他们把一个疯子的记忆注入我的大脑，目的是想看看它会如何影响一个正常人的性格。至少，这是我能想到的最好的了。}
{321}{}{嗯...如果这是真的，那就太糟糕了。但究竟是什么原因让他们选择你作为测试样本呢?}
{322}{}{哇，伙计，那真是糟透了。不管怎样，这件事情过去了。那些混蛋科学家早就死了，再也不能对你做什么了。跟我来，我们离开这个地方。} 
{330}{}{实际上是“我”主动找“他们”的。我打了他们登出来的广告电话，广告说他们会给健康的测试对象付一大笔钱。我要这笔钱，嗯。但很明显这是我这辈子最严重的错误。我甚至不能告诉你他们让我遭受的恐怖。[他眼角反射着泪光。他长叹一口气，抹去泪水]无论如何，谢谢你，老兄。我最终从这个噩梦中自由了。}

#{340}{}{So how 'bout it, pal? Can we partner up? Not only will you get to feel cooler by hanging out me, but I can handle myself in a fight.

For all I know, the first tree I piss on could open up its mouth and bite my cock off.老伙计，那这样如何？我们组队吧？不只是你离开我会更冷，我在打斗中也可以照顾我自己。妈的。我本来单干很不错的，但是我不知道这个世界都会潜伏着些什么。我怀疑我尿尿的第一棵树就想张开嘴咬掉我老二。}

{522}{}{好，不开玩笑。继续...}



#{530}{}{Alright, you see, it's all part of their "experiments". These crazy fucking doctors were doing some kind of tests on the "nature of human evil" or some crap. They were injecting me with the memories of a maniac, in order to see how it would effect the personality of a normal person. At least, that's the best I could figure it.好，你瞧，这全是他们“实验”的一部分。这些狗杂种医生在做一些诸如关于“人性本恶”的测试。他们给我注入了一个疯子的记忆，试图看看这怎么影响一个普通人的人性。至少，这是我做知道的。}

#{540}{}{Heh, you see that's the funny thing. *I* actually came to *them*. Answered an add they put out saying they'd pay big bucks for healthy test subjects.

He sighs deeply and wipes the tears away.] Anyway, thanks to you, 嗨，你看这是个搞笑事情。“我”就是为“他们”来的。他们的广告说，给健康的测试对象付一大笔钱，而且，正好是我这辈子最大的错误。我甚至无法告诉你他们对我所做的恐怖。[他的研究闪烁着泪花，他深叹一口气，擦掉眼泪。]无论如何，谢谢你。}

#{550}{}{So how 'bout it, babe? Can we partner up? Not only do I bring my striking good looks to the table, but I can handle myself in a fight.

For all I know, the first tree I piss on could open up its mouth and bite my cock off.这怎么样，美人？我们能组队吗？不仅仅我闪亮发光的英俊外表，战斗力我也能照顾好自己。天哪，我单干其实更好，但我不知道外面有什么疯狂玩意儿。就我所知，我尿尿的第一棵树就张开嘴差点咬掉了我的蛋蛋。}
#{551}{}{Alright, you can travel with me, but I'm gonna keep a close eye on you. The second you even think about stepping out of line, I'll put you down. 好，你可以跟我走。我会紧盯着你的。一旦你想要越线，我就干掉你。}

The more you can tell me, the longer you get to live.听着，小靓仔。我给你解冻并不是要回答你问题看你打扮自己的。我让你活这么久，只想你告诉我你可能有用的信息。开始说说吧。你说得越多，我让你活得越久。}

{620}{}{谢谢你的不介意，朋友。[他走到你后面，打开了一个锁箱。他非常习惯地穿起了一套精细裁剪的套装，口袋里装入了锁箱里的东西。接着他拿出一把随身的梳子，开始用一种近乎苛刻的态度，仔细地雕刻和装饰他的闪亮黑发]所以，医生在哪里？}
{621}{}{你难倒我了。不管他在哪里，他早就死了。你瞧，你被冻在这里已经很久了。}
{622}{}{听着，崽子。我给你解冻并不是要回答你问题和看你打扮自己的。我让你活这么久，是要你告诉我可能有用的信息。开始说吧，你说得越多，我让你活得越久。}


#{630}{}{Is that so? [He regards you curiously.] You don't exactly look like you belong here, bud, yet you've decided to release me and I'd like to know why. I assume you know who I am?是么？[他好奇地看着你]你看起来完全不属于这里。但是，你决定释放我，我想知道为什么。我估计你知道我是谁吧？}
#{631}{}{Yeah, you're Dex, right? If what I read about you is true, then you're one evil son of a bitch. I like that.是的，你是德克斯，对吧？如果你的资料没错的话，你就是个他妈的邪恶的狗杂种。}
#{632}{}{Well, according to that computer, you're Dex, a narcissistic, sociopathic killer from before the great silence. I only unthawed you so I could put you down like the sick dog you are.嗯，那台电脑说，你是德克斯，一个自恋狂，大寂静之前的反社会杀手。我放你出来只为了能把你揍得像条死狗。}
#{633}{}{No idea, but you are giving off these evil vibes and I approve.不知道，但是我猜你很邪恶。}

{630}{}{是么？[他好奇地看着你]你看起来完全不属于这里。但是，你决定释放我，我想知道为什么。我估计你知道我是谁吧？}
{631}{}{是的，你叫德克斯，对吧？如果你的资料没错的话，你就是个他妈邪恶的反社会杂种。}
{632}{}{嗯，那台电脑上面写得很清楚，你叫德克斯，一个自恋狂，大寂静之前的反社会杀手。我放你出来只为了能把你揍得像条死狗。}
{633}{}{不知道，但是我不认为你是个好人。}


#{640}{}{[His cool demeanor vanishes and his eyes flare with rage.] You think you can intimidate ME? Do you have the first FUCKING CLUE who you're talking to? Come here and I'll show you what I'm capable of![他冷静的态度消失了，眼里闪过一丝怒火]你觉得你可以威胁我？你他妈知道你在跟谁说话？过来，我让你看看我是谁。}
#{641}{}{[Done.]结束} 
#{650}{}{[Dex grins at you, revealing a set of perfect teeth-a product of pre-war dentistry that look strange to you in all their pearly white symmetry.] I knew there was something I liked about you. You've got good taste. I don't suppose you're also a fan of The King?[德克斯咧着嘴笑着看着你。牙齿很好――战前高科技的产物。这种珍珠般发白的对称感让你很陌生。]我知道你有些东西我很喜欢。你的品味不错。我不认为你也是皇帝的爱好者吧？}
#{651}{}{Uh... [Blank stare.]呃...[目光无神]}
#{652}{}{Oh yeah, I love that... uh, what'd you call it, The King? Yeah, huge fan.是的，我喜欢那个...你说的那个...皇帝？没错，我是大粉丝！}

{640}{}{[他冷静的态度消失了，眼里闪过一丝怒火]你觉得你可以威胁我？你他妈知道你在跟谁说话？过来，我让你看看我是谁。}
{641}{}{[结束]} 
{650}{}{[德克斯咧开嘴笑着看着你，他的牙齿很好――这应该是战前高科技的产物。那种珍珠般发白的对称牙齿让你很陌生。]我知道你有些东西我很喜欢。你的品味不错。我不认为你也是皇帝的爱好者吧？}
{651}{}{呃...[目光无神]}
{652}{}{是的，我喜欢那个...你说的那个...皇帝？没错，我是大粉丝！}


#{660}{}{Nevermind, bud. [Dex takes another look around the room and whistles.] This place has really gone to shit. How long did you say it's been?别介意，兄弟。[德克斯又看了看周围，吹了声口哨]这个地方就是一沱屎。你说这有多久了？}
#{661}{}{It's been over a hundred and fifty years since the great silence brought an end to the Old Ones... *your* people.自从大寂静给老一代人，*你”那一代人，画上句点之后，已经150年了。}

{660}{}{别介意，兄弟。[德克斯又看了看周围，吹了声口哨]这个地方就是一沱屎。你说这有多久了？}
{661}{}{自从大寂静给*你*那一代人画上句点之后，已经150年了。}


#{665}{}{Great Silence? The Old Ones? How about you spare me this cryptic bullshit and just tell me what happened?}
#{666}{}{The Great Silence is what my people call the end of your world. When the great fires rained down from the sky and scorched the land. You'll find the world is nothing like the one you knew.}

{665}{}{大寂静？*我*那一代人？别和我讲这些让人听不懂的废话，告诉我发生了什么事。}
{666}{}{大寂静，没错，就是大寂静。我们把它称之为你们世界的尽头。当大火像雨点一样从天而降，把地面烤得焦酥发脆。你会发现外面的世界已经不像你所知道的那样了。}


#{670}{}{No shit, so they actually dropped the bombs, huh? I guess the vault project wasn't just a big waste of the tax-payers' money, after all.}
#{671}{}{Wait. You know of the vaults?} 
#{680}{}{Know of them? Hell, I killed my first hooker not far from where they were building the Chicago Vault. Those were the days... [He stops and regards you with amusement.] You're really eating this up, aren't you?}
{670}{}{不是吧，所以他们真的投了炸弹？我想避难所项目并不是在浪费纳税人的钱。}
{671}{}{你知道神圣的避难所？} 
{680}{}{知道？我可不仅仅是知道，我杀的第一个妓女就在他们建芝加哥避难所的不远处。那些日子...[他停下来狡黠地看着你]你需要这方面的信息，对吧？}




#{681}{}{TELL ME MORE OF THE VAULTS!}
#{682}{}{Well, I'm supposed to be trying to find a Vault for my tribe. Once I do, I'm expected to find a G.E.C.K. so we can use its power to save my dying village. Anything you can tell me about the Vaults could make my job a hell of a lot easier.}
#{683}{}{Well, you see, I had been chosen by my people to try and find a Vault. I risked my life on several occasions to find that damn Holy Vault and I finally was successful in finding it. I am curious what else you might know of these places.} 
#{690}{}{I'll tell you what, bud. You need help finding these Vaults, and I need someone to show me the ropes, so to speak, in this crazy world of yours. So what do you say... partner?}
#{691}{}{Hell, no need to try and convince me. I'd be happy to have you along just to see your handiwork first hand.}
#{692}{}{I don't know, Dex. Let's just say I let you come along with me, and we make it back to the remote safety of a settlement. Once there, how do I know you won't try and slit my throat the first chance you get?}

{681}{}{告诉我你知道的事情！}
{682}{}{我需要为我的部落找一个避难所。在里面我很可能可以找到伊甸园创造器，我需要用它的力量来拯救我垂死的村子。你告诉我的任何关于避所难的事情，都能让我的工作轻松很多。}
{683}{}{嗯，我被我的人民选中去寻找一个避难所。在冒了不少危险之后，我终于成功地找到了它。我很好奇你对这些地方还知道些什么。} 
{690}{}{我会把我知道的都告诉你的。这么说吧，你需要有人帮助你找到这些避难所，而我需要有人告诉我，怎么在这个疯狂的世界里活下去。那你觉得如何...“拍档”？}
{691}{}{见鬼，没必要试着说服我。我很高兴你能和我一起，让我看看你第一个作品。}
{692}{}{我不知道，德克斯。假设我让你和我一起走，我们也回到了安全的地方。但到了那里，我怎么知道你不会一有机会就试图割开我的喉咙？}



#{700}{}{I can tell you're no saint, so I could ask you the same thing. But to answer your question, I wouldn't kill you because that'd fuck me over. I'll be honest, }
#{701}{}{, I don't give a fuck about anyone, or anything, except for myself. If the world is as fucked up as you say it is, then sticking with you is the best shot I've got. It's as simple as that.}
#{702}{}{Fair enough. Let's go.}
#{703}{}{I'm just fucking with you Dex. I never actually had any intention of bringing you with me. I just thought I'd have a bit of fun with you before caving your skull in.} 
#evil female intro
#{800}{}{[As you approach the cryogenic chamber, you see an attractive naked man sprawled on the floor. He draws his knees up and hugs them against his chest. He sits there for several moments, staring blankly ahead as his body quakes and his teeth chatter. Gradually, he seems to calm down.]}
#{801}{}{Uh, hey...}


{700}{}{我看得出来，你也不是什么好人，所以我也可以问你同样的问题。现在我们回过头谈你刚刚的问题，我不会杀你，因为我并不把想事情搞砸。老实说, }
{701}{}{我不在乎任何人或任何事，除了我自己。如果这个世界像你说的那么糟糕，那么跟着你就是我最好的机会，就这么简单。}
{702}{}{很好，我们走吧。}
{703}{}{我只是在跟你开玩笑，德克斯。我从没想过带你一起走。我只是想在把你的头盖骨掀开之前和你玩一会儿。} 


#evil female intro
#{800}{}{[你打开了冷冻仓，你看到一个迷人裸男趴在地板上。他蜷缩着膝盖，把膝盖抱在胸前。他在那里坐了好一会儿，双眼无神，直视前方，身体和牙齿都在发抖。慢慢地，他冷静下来了。]}
#{801}{}{Uh, hey...}

{800}{}{[As you approach the cryogenic chamber, you see an attractive naked man sprawled on the floor. He draws his knees up and hugs them against his chest. He sits there for several moments, staring blankly ahead as his body quakes and his teeth chatter. Gradually, he seems to calm down.]}
{801}{}{呃，你还好吗...}


#{810}{}{[He snaps his head towards you and leaps to his feet. He watches you intently, then glances around like a cornered animal. When his eyes return to you, they soften, and he relaxes as his memories come flooding back to him. He quickly alters his composure, projecting cool confidence, despite his nakedness.] Hey doll, I know I'm quite the sight to behold, but it's a tad chilly in here. You mind if I get dressed?}
#{811}{}{I guess there's no harm-}
#{812}{}{Well, I-}

{810}{}{他突然把头转向你，站起来。他专心地看着你，然后像一只在绝境里的动物一样环视四周。当他再次看向你，他的眼睛变得柔和下来，记忆潮水般涌了出来。他突然冷静了下来，释放出冷静的自信，即使他还是赤裸着的。]嗨，美人，我知道我现在很好看，但是这里有点太冷了。你能让我穿上衣服吗？}
{811}{}{我觉得无妨-}
{812}{}{好的，我-}



#{820}{}{Of course you don't mind. Thanks, babe. [He steps past you, gently slapping your rump, and opens a nearby locker. He casually dresses himself in a finely tailored suit, then pockets the locker's contents. Utilizing a pocket comb, he begins to sculpt and style his slicked dark hair with the quick precision of a seasoned pro.] I don't think I've seen you around, doll, and I doubt I'd forget a face like yours. Name's, Dex, but I'm sure you know that. Mind if I ask yours?}
#{821}{}{I'm }
#{822}{}{. But you should know I've got a strict rule of not dating any strange men I unthaw. Since you've been on ice for the past century and a half, I'll assume your hand spasmed and accidentally slapped my ass. But if it happens again, I'll rip your cock off. Got it?}
#{823}{}{My name's }
#{824}{}{. It's nice to meet you, Dex. I can't imagine what it must be like to wake up after being frozen for over a hundred
and fifty years.}
#{825}{}{Yeah, I DO mind, you fucking creep. I only unthawed you so I could put you down like the sick dog you are.}
#{826}{}{Forget about names. How 'bout you take those clothes back off and show me what pre-war men are made of.}

{820}{}{谢谢你的不介意，美人。[他走过你，轻轻地拍了拍你的屁股，打开了最近的一个锁柜。他非常习惯地穿上一套修身的外套，然后把锁柜里的东西打包了。接着他用一把梳子，开始熟练而又快速地梳理他光滑的黑发。}
{821}{}{我的名字是 }
{822}{}{。另外你应该知道，我对挑选男人有一套很严格的规则，而你很显然在这之外。但既然你已经被冻了一个半世纪，我就先假设你的手是因为痉挛而无意间碰到我的臀部。如果再来一次，我就会切掉你的卵蛋。明白？}
{823}{}{我的名字是 }
{824}{}{。认识你很不错，德克斯。我很难想象被冰冻了150年后苏醒的感觉。}
{825}{}{抱歉，我很介意。你这该死的混蛋，我解冻你只是为把你干得像死狗一样趴下来。}
{826}{}{名字？不要管这个了。你为什么不脱下这些衣服，让我看看战前的男人是怎么样的？}




#{830}{}{[Grins and begins to undress.] You're my kind of gal. Prepare yourself to experience Dex, the Duke of Sex.}
#{831}{}{[After an intense love making session on the floor of the chamber, the two of you collapse in exhaustion. You notice Dex slyly going for a hidden knife. You quickly clutch his genitals.]}
#{832}{}{Touch that knife, and I'll turn you into the Dickless Duke. Besides, why ruin a good thing? The two of us could have so much fun together.}
#{833}{}{I... think I'm in love. [Dex has joined your party.]}


{830}{}{[笑着开始脱衣服] 你是我喜欢的类型，准备好见识一下“性爱公爵”德克斯了吗？}
{831}{}{[在房间的地板上进行了一场激烈的性爱后，你们两个精疲力竭地倒下了。你注意到德克斯狡猾地去找一把藏起来的刀。你很快抓住了他的老二。]}
{832}{}{如果你敢摸一下那把刀，我就让你变成一个没有老二的公爵。再说，为什么要毁掉一件好事呢？我们两个可以在一起玩得很开心。}
{833}{}{我...我想我恋爱了。 [德克斯加入了你的队伍。]}


#{840}{}{Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back up a second, sweetheart. Did you just say a hundred and fifty years? [He shakes his head in disbelief.] That is un-fucking-believable. [He checks out his reflection.] But you gotta admit, I'm looking damn good for my age. [He grins at you, revealing a set of perfect teeth-a product of pre-war dentistry that look strange to you in all their pearly white symmetry.]}
#{841}{}{Sure, some girls might think you're an attractive guy, but I'm sure they're a bit put off by that whole murderous psycho thing you've got going on.}
#{842}{}{Alright, this is sickening. Let's see how great you look after I put a couple holes in your face.}
#{843}{}{Sure, some girls might think you're an attractive guy, but I'm sure they're a bit put off by the murderous psycho vibes you're giving off.}

{840}{}{哇，哇，哇。等一下，甜心。你是说一百五十年前吗？他难以置信地摇了摇头。那真他妈的不可思议。[他看了看镜子里的自己]但你得承认，就我的年龄而言，我看起来棒极了。[他朝你咧嘴一笑，露出了一副完美的牙齿――应该是战前牙科的产品，在你看来，它有着珍珠般的匀称白色，看起来很奇怪。]}
{841}{}{当然，有些女孩可能会觉得你很有魅力，但我肯定她们很快会对你身上那种杀人不眨眼的精神状态感到恐惧。}
{842}{}{好吧，这真不错。让我在你脸上打几个洞，看看你看起来有多棒。}
{843}{}{当然，有些女孩可能会觉得你很有魅力，但我肯定她们会对你散发出来的残忍气息感到恐惧。}


#did not read the bio
#{844}{}{Not bad for an ice man. Why were you frozen in there, anyway?}
#{845}{}{Eh, you're not my type. Anyway, why were you frozen in there?}
#{846}{}{Alright, this is sickening. Let's see how great you look after I put a couple holes in your face.}

{844}{}{以一块冰鲜肉的标准来说还不错。你为什么被冻在里面？}
{845}{}{你不是我喜欢的类型。不管怎样，你为什么被困在里面？}
{846}{}{好吧，这真不错。让我在你脸上打几个洞，看看你有多棒。}


#{850}{}{Well they usually don't see that side of me until it's too late. But anyways... [Dex takes another look around the room and whistles.] This place has really gone to shit. So what have I missed out on?}
#{851}{}{It's been over a hundred and fifty years since the great silence brought an end to the Old Ones... *your* people.}

{850}{}{她们通常不会看到我的那一面，直到为时已晚。但无论如何...德克斯又环视了一下房间，吹起了口哨。这个地方看起来就像一沱屎，我错过了什么吗？}
{851}{}{自从“大寂静”结束了*你*那一代人之后，已经有150多年了。}



#{855}{}{Great Silence? The Old Ones? How about you spare me this cryptic bullshit and just tell me what happened?}
#{856}{}{The Great Silence is what my people call the end of your world. When the great fires rained down from the sky and scorched the land. You'll find the world is nothing like the one you knew.}


{855}{}{大寂静！？你别开玩笑了，到底发生了什么？}
{856}{}{大寂静就是你们所说的世界末日。天空下起了火焰雨，土地被烤得和曲奇饼一样酥脆，如果到了外面，你会发现这个世界与你所认识的完全不同。}


#{860}{}{No shit, so they actually dropped the bombs, huh? I guess the vault project wasn't just a big waste of the tax-payers' money, after all.}
#{861}{}{Wait. You know of the vaults?}

{860}{}{不是吧，所以他们真的投了炸弹？看来避难所项目并不是在浪费纳税人的钱了。}

{900}{}{我会告诉你想要知道的，但现在能先说说他们把我放到冰块里之后发生了什么。我是说，这个地方就是一沱屎，而且你看起来像是从某些科幻冒险传说中走出来的。}

{1200}{}{那么，关于避难所你能告诉我什么？}
{1201}{}{那么，现在您还记得关于避难所的任何事情吗？}
{1202}{}{关于大寂静之前的事情，你能告诉我一些有用的信息吗？}


#{1210}{}{Well, lets see... Huh. You know what? My mind's still a little foggy about some things. You'll have to ask me later.}
#{1211}{}{Hmm. Alright.}

#{1220}{}{The vaults... the vaults... Nope, not yet.}
#{1221}{}{Hmm. Alright.}

#{1230}{}{Yes, actually, I remember... Wait, never mind, I forgot.}
#{1231}{}{Hmm. Alright.}

{1210}{}{嗯，让我想一想...嗯。你知道吗？看来冰冻对我有些后遗症，我对一些事情还有些糊涂。你以后再问我如何？}
{1211}{}{好吧。}

{1220}{}{避难所...避难所...没错，避难所，但目前我还没想到有关这方面的信息。}
{1221}{}{好吧。}

{1230}{}{没错，避难所，呃，等等...我刚刚想起来些什么了，我又忘了。}
{1231}{}{好吧。}




#{1240}{}{Well, I used to live by the Chicago Vault. Does that help?}
#{1241}{}{Do you know if it had a G.E.C.K.?}
#{1242}{}{I'm sure it did. I'm pretty sure they all did.}
#{1243}{}{Alright, now we're on to something. Can you tell me where this Vault is located?}
#{1244}{}{No problem. It's about 2,000 miles in that direction. [Dex points eastward.]}
#{1245}{}{Oh. Well then. Never mind.}


{1240}{}{嗯，好吧，我曾经住在芝加哥金库附近。这对你有帮助吗？}
{1241}{}{你知道它里面是否有一个伊甸园创造器吗？}
{1242}{}{我敢肯定它里面有这个。}
{1243}{}{太好了，让我们开始做点什么。你能告诉我这个避难所在哪里吗？}
{1244}{}{没问题。往那个方向大约2000英里。[德克斯指向东方]}
{1245}{}{哦。那么，好的，不要紧。}



#{1250}{}{There was one man, greater than any other, that we called, "The King". He was a handsome man with impeccable style, amazing hair, and a voice of gold. With a simple thrust of his pelvis he could impregnate every woman in sight. He was worshiped as a God by the people of the world. He was my father.}
#{1251}{}{Interesting...}

{1250}{}{曾经有一个男人，我们称为“国王”。他是一个英俊的男人，有着无可挑剔的风格，闪亮的头发和黄金般的嗓音。只要轻轻推一下骨盆，他就能使眼前的每个女人都怀孕。他被世人奉为神明。他是我的父亲。}
{1251}{}{这真有趣...}


#{1260}{}{There were immortals that lived secretly among us. They had to battle each other to the death with swords until only one remained to claim "The Prize".}
#{1261}{}{Wait. If they were immortal, how could they kill each other?}
#{1262}{}{They could only be killed by decapitation. When one immortal decapitated another, a quickening would be released, giving the slain immortal's powers to the victor.}
#{1263}{}{What exactly do you mean by "powers"?}
#{1264}{}{Uh, fighting powers? Mechanic powers? I don't know, it was kind of vague.}
#{1265}{}{Interesting...}

{1260}{}{有一些神灵在我们中间秘密地生活着。他们不得不用剑决斗至死，直到只剩下一个人来领奖。}
{1261}{}{等等。如果神是不死的，他们怎么能自相残杀呢？}
{1262}{}{他们只能被斩首处死。当一个不死之身砍下另一个神的头颅时，就会释放一个生命，把被杀死的不死之身的力量交给胜利者。}
{1263}{}{你说的“力量”是什么意思？}
{1264}{}{呃，战斗能力？机械能力？我不知道，这部分记忆有点模糊。}
{1265}{}{这真有趣...}


#{1270}{}{There were these giant lizards, some bigger than buildings, that people would ride around on. We called them dinosaurs, and they were known as man's best friend.}
#{1271}{}{Wow, did you have one?}
#{1272}{}{Of course. I rode a T-rex, the most badass giant lizard of them all. Only mine was even more badass because it had wings. Basically, it was a dragon.}
#{1273}{}{Interesting...}

{1270}{}{这里曾经有一些巨大的蜥蜴，有些比建筑物还大，人们可以骑着它们到处走。我们称它们为恐龙，它们被认为是人类最好的朋友。}
{1271}{}{哇，你有一只吗？}
{1272}{}{当然。我骑的是雷克萨斯霸王龙，恐龙中最凶猛的巨型蜥蜴。实际上我的恐龙是最厉害的，因为它有翅膀。基本上，它应该算是一条龙。}
{1273}{}{这真有趣...}



#{1280}{}{In the year 2011, The Awaking took place, and long dormant magical creatures, like Orcs, Elves, Trolls, and Dwarves returned to the world, along with magic. Magic and technology then clashed in a dark world of corporate warfare, waged in the shadows of the sprawling metropolises.}
#{1281}{}{Wow, what happened to the magical creatures?}
#{1282}{}{I guess they got taken out when the bombs fell. Except it looks like you've still got some Dwarves, Trolls, and Zombies around.}
#{1283}{}{Interesting...}

{1280}{}{在2011年，大觉醒发生了，很多休眠了很久的魔法生物，例如兽人，精灵，巨魔和矮人一起回到了世界。随后，魔法和技术在一个充斥着现代气息的黑暗世界中发生了冲突，这些战争是大都市的阴影中发生的。}
{1281}{}{哇，这些神奇的生物后来怎么了？}
{1282}{}{我猜他们在炸弹落下时被干掉的。当然我估计有些幸存者，你看，你的周围还有一些矮人、巨魔和僵尸。}
{1283}{}{这真有趣...}



#{1290}{}{There was this gigantic green lizard called Godzilla. Godzilla would alternate between terrorizing Japan, and saving its ass against giant space invaders. There was another violent gigantic lizard called the Tarrasque. I think they were cousins or something.}
#{1291}{}{Wow, what happened to them?}
#{1292}{}{Godzilla got taken out by Ferris Bueller. As for the Tarrasque, we had a giant robot battle him. The robot, piloted by yours truly, punched the Tarrasque so hard that be broke apart into thousands of little Tarrasques that scattered all over California.}
#{1293}{}{Interesting...}

{1290}{}{这里曾经有一种巨大的绿色蜥蜴，叫做哥斯拉。哥斯拉既要恐吓日本，又要保护自己的屁股不受太空入侵者的伤害。还有另一种凶猛的巨型蜥蜴，叫做塔拉斯克，我想他们是表亲吧。}
{1291}{}{哇，它们后来怎么了？}
{1292}{}{哥斯拉被奥特曼带走了。至于塔拉斯克，我们有一个巨大的机器人和他战斗。机器人，由和你一样真实的驾驶员驾驶，他猛烈地击打塔拉斯克，以至于它分裂成几万个分散在加利福尼亚各地的小塔拉斯克。}
{1293}{}{这真有趣...}


#{1300}{}{The earth was full of hot women, and I held the world record for the amount of sexual partners I had.}
#{1301}{}{I see. You know, Dex, some of these things you're telling me are a bit... out there. I get this strange feeling that it might not all be true.}
#{1302}{}{Hey, were YOU alive back then? No, you weren't. So who's the pre-war expert here? So trust me, it's all true. But hey, if you're not going to believe me, then I'm done telling you stories for now.}
#{1303}{}{Huh. That's too bad, because they've been so helpful so far.}

{1300}{}{地球上曾经到处都是热辣的女人，我一直保持着性伴侣数量的世界纪录。}
{1301}{}{我明白了。德克斯，你告诉我的一些事情有点...。我有一种奇怪的感觉，那就是这一切可能都不是真的。}
{1302}{}{嘿，你有活在那个时代吗？不，你并没有，对吧。那么谁是战前知识的专家呢？相信我，这都是真的。如果你不相信我的话，那我现在就不给你讲故事了。}
{1303}{}{嗯，那太糟糕了。我想到目前为止，你说的事情一直很有帮助。}


#distance
#{1400}{}{Just tell me where you want me.}
#{1401}{}{Just tell me where you want me, babe.}
#{1402}{}{No problem. I wouldn't want to make you nervous. [Dex grins.]}
#{1403}{}{Sure. If you think you need to keep an eye on me, I'm fine with that.}
#{1404}{}{Sure. I understand it's hard to concentrate when I'm too close. [Dex grins.]}
#{1405}{}{[Dex cocks his eyebrow at you and winks.]}
#{1406}{}{No problem.}

{1400}{}{告诉我，你要我去哪里。}
{1401}{}{告诉我，你要我去哪里，宝贝。}
{1402}{}{没问题。我不想让你太紧张。[德克斯笑着]}
{1403}{}{没错，如果你认为你需要关注我，我可以接受。}
{1404}{}{你确定？我担心当我离得太近的时候，你很难集中注意力。[德克斯笑着]}
{1405}{}{[德克斯翘起眉毛朝你眨眼。]}
{1406}{}{没问题。}


#put weapon away
#{1500}{}{Why? You don't trust me with weapons? [He laughs.] Sure thing, if it'll put your mind at ease.}

{1500}{}{为什么？你不相信我懂得拿武器？[他笑着说]实战示范？当然可以，只要你放心。}

#remove armor
#{1600}{}{Uh, sure. But just so we're on the same page here, you know I'm into chicks... right?}
#{1601}{}{All-right. [Dex strips off his armor and begins stripping off his clothes. He stops when he sees you glaring at him.] You're sending me mixed signals here, doll. Dex doesn't like to be toyed with. Just the armor it is.}

{1600}{}{嗯，当然。但我们一起站在这里，你知道我只喜欢妓女...对吧？}
{1601}{}{好的。[德克斯脱下他的盔甲，然后开始脱衣服。当他看到你怒视他时，他停下来] 你给我的信号很复杂，宝贝儿。德克斯不喜欢被人耍，看来你说的只是盔甲而已。}


#weapons you can use
#{1700}{}{Well, I can do wondrous things with knives. It's like an art. There's something very special about the way a blade slices into flesh, you know what I mean?}
#{1701}{}{Uh... yeah, sure. Anything else you can use? Feel free to be less creepy about it this time.}
#{1702}{}{Well, my Uncle was one of them military hard-asses. He trained me with pistols and SMGs, and I even got to toy around with some energy weapon prototypes they were working on. He thought I'd follow in his footsteps and be a puppet for Uncle Sam, but I, uh... Let's just say I went down a different path.}
#{1703}{}{That sounds alright. Anything else?}
#{1704}{}{I've been known to beat some ass with good 'ol fisticuffs. When I was a teen, I tried my hand at Karate for awhile, but they kept feeding me all this shit about being more disciplined, so I told 'em to fuck off. Anything else you need to know?}
#{1705}{}{That should cover it. Thanks.}

{1700}{}{嗯，我可以用刀子做很多奇妙的事情，就像一门艺术。你知道我的意思吗？}
{1701}{}{嗯...是的，当然。除了这个之外还有什么？这次不要再让人觉得毛骨悚然了。}
{1702}{}{我叔叔是一个硬汉军人。他用手枪和smg训练我，我甚至玩起了他们正在研发的能量武器原型。他以为我会追随他的脚步成为山姆大叔的傀儡，但我...假设我走了一条不同的道路。}
{1704}{}{大家都知道我打过几次架。当我还是个十几岁的孩子的时候，我试着练了一段时间空手道，但是他们一直在给我灌输要更有纪律性一类的东西，所以我告诉他们滚开。你还需要知道什么？}
{1705}{}{那就是我想要知道的，谢谢。}


#heal
#{1800}{}{I'm good to go.}
#{1801}{}{I've been better, but I can handle it.}
#{1802}{}{I'm not feeling very good.}
#{1803}{}{I think I hear the King calling. I can see the light...}

{1800}{}{我感觉还不错。}
{1801}{}{我觉得不太好，但我可以处理它。}
{1802}{}{我感觉不太好。}
{1803}{}{我想我听到国王在呼唤。我能看到光...}

#wait for me
#{1900}{}{No problem. But you're going to feel a lot less cool without me around. Just saying...}
#{1901}{}{Sure. I'll catch ya later.}
#{1902}{}{Sure, I'll wait. But if you don't come back, then I'm going to start looking for you, and it won't be pleasant when I find you.}
#{1903}{}{Alright, as long as you aren't just ditching me to make room for some other jerk. Because I promise you I'm better than them in every conceivable way.}
#{1904}{}{No problem.}
#{1905}{}{No problem, babe.}
#{1906}{}{Alright, as long as you aren't just ditching me to make room for some other jerk. Because I promise you I'm better than them in every conceivable way.}
#{1907}{}{Getting you too hot and bothered am I? I understand.}

{1900}{}{没问题。但如果没有我在身边，你会觉得不那么酷。当然，我只是说说...}
{1901}{}{好的，我待会儿再找你。}
{1902}{}{当然，我会等待的。但是如果你再不回来，我就要开始找你了，而且找你过程也会不太愉快。}
{1903}{}{好吧，只要你不是抛弃我为其他混蛋腾出名额。因为我向你保证，我在任何方面都比他们强。}
{1904}{}{没问题。}
{1905}{}{没问题，宝贝。}
{1906}{}{好吧，只要你不是抛弃我为其他混蛋腾出名额。因为我向你保证，我在任何方面都比他们强。}
{1907}{}{让你太热了是吗？我明白了。}



#gear
#{2000}{}{Alright, what about it?}
#{2001}{}{Look, I know I was on ice for a long time, but trust me, everything is in PERFECT working order. If you want, I'll prove it to you right here, right now. [Dex stops when he sees you glaring] Oh, I see, my *other* gear. What about it?} 

{2000}{}{好吧，关于它你有什么想说的？}
{2001}{}{听着，我知道我在冰块里呆了很长时间，但是相信我，我的一切都在完美的工作状态中。如果你愿意，我现在就给你证明。[德克斯看到你怒目而视，停住了]哦，我知道了，我的其他装备什么的呢？}

{2031}{}{我们又该走了。}


#life story
#{3000}{}{So, what's your story?}
#{3001}{}{What, like my life story? Look, I know I'm pretty fascinating, but I don't want to stand around talking forever. My mouth will get all dry and there's not a whole lot of water to go around-it's just not a good situation to be in. But I suppose I could sum it up for you if you really want to know... Actually, I DO like to talk about myself so I'll leave up to you. You want the quick summary or the version with more detail?}
#{3002}{}{Just give me the quick summary.}
#{3003}{}{Lets hear the detailed version.}
#{3004}{}{Never mind, I lost interest.}

{3000}{}{告诉我一下关于你的事情？}
{3001}{}{什么，你想听我的生活故事？听着，我知道我很迷人，但我不想站在这里一直说一直说。那样我的嘴巴会变得很干，要知道这个世界里没有太多的纯净水。但如果你真的想知道的话，我可以为你总结一下...实际上，我很喜欢谈论我自己，所以您想要精简版本还是详细版本？}
{3002}{}{精简版。}
{3003}{}{详细版。}
{3004}{}{我想我还是先不要听了。}


#quick summary
#{3010}{}{Alright, basically, ever since I was a kid, I liked to kill things. I could talk about my childhood and my shitty parents and try to analyze why I like to do it, but I don't need an excuse. I do it simply because I can, and it's fun. By the time I was sixteen I spent my days as a popular high school heartthrob, and my nights as a ripper of Chicago's young working girls.}
#{3011}{}{Uh huh. Go on.}
#{3012}{}{Then one day I caught my girlfriend making the beast with two backs with another guy. I butchered them, set the place on fire, then high tailed it out of Chicago. Spent the next ten years traveling the nation, seducing girls, then cutting 'em up. Then they finally caught me, and my trail turned me into a celebrity.}
#{3013}{}{So, then what?}
#{3014}{}{So then one of my new fans, Alice, helps me escape. The two of us go on a three week cross country murder rampage before we finally go down in a shootout. Then, for some reason, The Man decides to stitch me back together and run all these tests on me. And that's how I wound up at the EPA where you found me.}
#{3015}{}{Thanks for the story.}

{3010}{}{好吧，基本上，从我小时候起，我就喜欢杀人。我可以谈论我的童年和我的糟糕的父母，并试图分析为什么我喜欢这样做。但我不需要一个借口。我这么做只是因为我能做到，而且很有趣。16岁的时候，我白天在高中时是一个受欢迎的万人迷，晚上我就变身成芝加哥年轻姑娘们的职业开膛手。}
{3011}{}{继续。}
{3012}{}{然后有一天我发现我的女朋友和另一个男人在一起了。我杀了他们，放火烧了那个地方。然后我离开了芝加哥，在接下来的十年里，我周游全国，勾引女孩，然后把她们切碎。然后，他们终于抓住了我，我的经历把我变成了一个名人。}
{3013}{}{所以，然后呢？}
{3014}{}{被抓到之后，我的一个新粉丝，爱丽丝，帮我逃走了。我们两个进行了为期三周的逃亡，我在枪战中被打中了，爱丽丝自杀。然后，出于某种原因，那些男人决定把我当成实验品，在我身上做所有这些测试。这就是你能在EPA找到我的原因。}
{3015}{}{谢谢你的故事。}


#detailed summary
#{3020}{}{Let's see... My Mom was a drug fiend and a whore, and my Dad was an ornery drunken bastard. Fortunately, my grandpa was alright for an old guy. Introduced me to The King's music. Unfortunately, he was claimed by the New Plague when I was seven. Then when I was ten, I watched from the closet as my Dad beat my Mom to death for forgetting to feed our dog, Captain Robeenie.}
#{3021}{}{This is off to a pleasant start. Go on.}
#{3022}{}{The bitch should've remembered to feed the Captain. Go on.}
#{3023}{}{So they put my Dad away and shipped me off to live with my Aunt and Uncle. You see, I was a little hell-raiser, even then, and my Uncle, being a military sort, thought he'd be able to straighten me out-turn me into a Red slaying soldier boy, just like the son he'd lost. He gave it his best shot, but I was a stubborn son-of-a-bitch.}
#{3024}{}{Uh huh. Go on.}
#{3025}{}{So anyway, we did a lot of moving around and it wasn't until I was in high school that we finally settled down in Chicago. That's when I took to sneaking out at night and knifing hookers. I'd been killing things for as long as I could remember, but gutting neighborhood critters didn't compare to the real deal, you know?}
#{3026}{}{Sure.}
#{3027}{}{So things were pretty sweet, for the most part. I mean, I fucking hated my Uncle and Aunt, but at school I was Mr. Popular. Every guy wanted to be my friend and every gal I looked at was willing to spread for me. Except for this one gal, Vicky. She actually took a bit of work. Amazing, I know, but eventually I got her to come around and become my girl.}
#{3028}{}{And all the while you were moonlighting as a serial killer?}
#{3029}{}{I don't really care about your high school sweetheart. Forget the story.}
#{3030}{}{Yeah. [Dex grins.] Those were the days. I was actually happy, you know? After we graduated, Vicky and I got our own little place together, and everything was aces. But that bitch had to go and ruin everything by sneaking around behind my back.}
#{3031}{}{How dare she.}
#{3032}{}{I caught her in the act, and I lost it. Things got real brutal. It was sloppy and there was no way I was going to be able to just cover it up. So I set the place on fire and hit the road. Did a lot of traveling, laid a lot of girls and left most of 'em dead. It wasn't a bad life, you know? It took 'em ten years, but the law finally caught up with me.}
#{3033}{}{Uh-oh. So then what?}
#{3034}{}{Then they put me on trial and it became a bit of media circus. The girls loved it because I'm a dreamboat, and everyone else loved it because it was a distraction from news about the New Plague and politics. So I thought I'd give 'em a real show.}
#{3035}{}{What'd you do?}
#{3036}{}{Well by then I'd made plenty of fans, but there was this one in particular, a real doll named Alice. She said she loved me and would do anything for me. So during my trail, she helped me make a break for it. It was a long shot, but we were lucky enough to pull it off. Then things got crazy... Are you sure you never heard about any of this?}
#{3037}{}{I'm sure, but go on.}
#{3038}{}{Never heard of it, and now I never want to. Just forget it, I'm bored.}
#{3039}{}{Well now that I was with Alice, it was kind of hard to revert back to my old ways of seducing women and slicing them open. Instead, we just starting thrill killing anyone that was convenient. It didn't matter how young or old, we were equal opportunity killers. But killing recklessly like that, we were easy to track. In three weeks they had us cornered. They gunned me down and Alice blew her own brains out.}
#{3040}{}{I see. Then what?}
#{3041}{}{So there I was, certain I was going to die, but then these G-Men stepped in and took me away. They got me back to a hundred percent, then started doing these tests on me, trying to figure out what makes me the way I am... Anyway, you can figure the rest, and my throats dry from talking. Damn, I was hoping to avoid that.}
#{3042}{}{Thanks for the story.}


{3020}{}{那就从一开始说吧...我的妈妈是一个瘾君子和妓女，我的爸爸是一个坏脾气的酒鬼私生子。幸运的是，我爷爷是一个很好的人，他把国王的音乐介绍给我。不幸的是，他在我七岁的时候被一场瘟疫夺去了生命。当我十岁的时候，我从壁橱里看到我爸爸打死了妈妈，因为我妈妈忘记喂我们的狗罗博船长。}
{3021}{}{这真不是一个愉快的开始，继续。}
{3022}{}{这只母狗应该记得喂船长才对，继续。}
{3023}{}{所以他们把我的父亲送走，让我和叔叔婶婶住在一起。你看，即使在当时我还是个小恶魔，我的叔叔，作为一个军人，仍然认为他能把我变回一个红色的士兵男孩，就像他失去的儿子一样。他尽了最大的努力，但我是个固执的混蛋，要知道我只是一个妓女的儿子啊。}
{3024}{}{继续。}
{3025}{}{总之，我们搬了很多次家，直到我上高中我们才最终在芝加哥定居下来。就在那时，我开始在晚上偷偷溜出去，用刀杀妓女。从我记事起，我就一直在杀东西，但是把附近动物的内脏挖出来和真正的杀人比起来，是完全不一样的，你知道吗？}
{3026}{}{没错。}
{3027}{}{所以大多数情况下，一切都很美好。我是说，我讨厌我的叔叔和阿姨，但在学校我是受欢迎的人。每一个男人都想成为我的朋友，我看到的每一个女孩都愿意为我播种。除了这个女孩，维姬。她实际上对我有所察觉，很神奇。但最终我让她改变了主意，让她成为了我的女朋友。}
{3028}{}{你一直都在做连环杀手的兼职吗？}
{3029}{}{我才不在乎你高中时的女朋友呢，跳过这部分的故事吧。}
{3030}{}{是的。[德克斯笑着]但那些日子，我真的很开心，你知道吗？毕业后，我和维姬有了自己的小房子，一切都是都向前好的方向发展。但那个贱人把一切都破坏了。}
{3031}{}{她后来怎么了。}
{3032}{}{我当场抓住了她，这让事情变得非常残酷，事发突然，要掩饰已经不可能。于是我放火烧了那个地方，然后上路了。我到了很多地方旅行，杀了很多女孩，生活还不错。但条子们花了十年的时间，法律最终还是追上了我。}
{3033}{}{哦，接下来的事情？}
{3034}{}{然后条子把我送上法庭，这就成了媒体的闹剧。女孩们喜欢这个故事，因为我是一个梦想家。政客也喜欢这个故事，因为它分散了人们对新的瘟疫和政治新闻的注意力，所以我想给他们一个真正的表演。}
{3035}{}{你干了什么？}
{3036}{}{那时候我已经有很多粉丝了，但是有一个特别的，一个真正的宝贝叫爱丽丝。她说她爱我，愿意为我做任何事。所以在我的旅程中，她帮我逃过一劫。这是一个不可能的机会，但是我们很幸运的成功了。你确定你从没听说过这些吗？}
{3037}{}{我确定，但请继续。}
{3038}{}{从来没听过，现在也不想听。算了吧，这个故事很无聊。}
{3039}{}{好吧，既然我和爱丽丝在一起了，就很难再回到我过去的勾引女人的生活了。相反，我们开始为了刺激杀死任何我们看上了的人。无论年轻还是年老，我们都是机会均等的杀手。但是这样鲁莽的杀戮让我们很容易被追踪。三周之内条子就把我们逼到了绝境。他们开枪打中了我，爱丽丝则朝自己脑袋开了一枪。}
{3040}{}{我明白了。然后呢？}
{3041}{}{所以我又被抓起来了，就在那里，我肯定自己会死，但是这些医生进来把我带走了。他们把我带到EPA，然后开始对我做这些测试，试图找出是什么让我变成现在这个样子...不管怎样，你可以想象剩下的，说了这么多，我喉咙都干了。妈的，其实我只是想离开那个鬼地方而以。}
{3042}{}{谢谢你的故事。}
