#{100}{}{You see Patrick.}
{100}{}{你看到帕特里克了。}
#{101}{}{You see a young man with a cute old-style beard.}
{101}{}{你看到一个留着可爱的老式胡须的年轻人。}
#{110}{}{[The young man smiles at you, but you see sadness in his eyes] Welcome, wanderer. My name is Patrick. Can I ask you a few questions?}
{110}{}{[年轻人对你微笑，但你看到他眼中的悲伤]欢迎你，流浪者。我叫帕特里克。我能问你几个问题吗？}
#{111}{}{That depends on the question.}
{111}{}{那要看问题了。}
#{112}{}{Sure, I have nothing to hide.}
{112}{}{当然，我没什么好隐瞒的。}
#{113}{}{Hell no, I ask the questions around here!}
{113}{}{不，我在这问问题！}
#{114}{}{No-no. I do not insist. If you don't want to talk, we can peacefully go our separate ways. But your opinion is of value to me, as the ones of folks living around here.}
{114}{}{不，不，我不坚持。如果你不想谈，我们可以和平地分道扬镳。但是你的意见对我来说很有价值，作为住在这附近的人。}
#{115}{}{But I'm not from around here...}
{115}{}{但我不是本地人。。。}
#{116}{}{Well, okay. Go, ask your questions.}
{116}{}{好吧，好吧。去问你的问题。}
#{117}{}{I don't want you asking something of me.}
{117}{}{我不想你问我什么。}
#{118}{}{That doesn't matter. We all walk the same earth.}
{118}{}{那没关系。我们都走在同一个地球上。}
#{119}{}{Nonetheless. The decision is yours.}
{119}{}{尽管如此。决定权在你。}
#{120}{}{Fine, then.}
{120}{}{那好吧。}
#{122}{}{Your words inspire confidence. Tell me, do you believe in God?}
{122}{}{你的话激发了信心。告诉我，你相信上帝吗？}
#{123}{}{I only believe in smooth barrel of my gun.}
{123}{}{我只相信我的枪管是光滑的。}
#{124}{}{Yes, I believe in Him!}
{124}{}{是的，我相信他！}
#{125}{}{No, I don't. Just don't.}
{125}{}{不，我不知道。只是不知道。}
#{126}{}{Are you serious? You might as well ask if I believe in Santa.}
{126}{}{你是认真的吗？你不妨问问我是否相信圣诞老人。}
#{127}{}{I don't even know who that is.}
{127}{}{我都不知道那是谁。}
#{128}{}{What guides you in your decisions? The word of God, your personal experiences, or something else?}
{128}{}{是什么指引你做出决定？上帝的话，你的个人经历，还是别的？}
#{129}{}{My Pip-Boy 2009 guides me along the path of logic and reason.}
{129}{}{我的Pip男孩2009引导我沿着逻辑和理性的道路前进。}
#{130}{}{I believe that without the Lord we are wandering blindly in the dark, and only He can guide our path.}
{130}{}{我相信没有主，我们是在黑暗中盲目地徘徊，只有他能指引我们的道路。}
#{131}{}{I have no need in anyone's advices and instructions to make important decisions in life.}
{131}{}{我不需要任何人的建议和指示来做人生中重要的决定。}
#{132}{}{I'm being led by bottle of booze mixed with iguana-on-a-stick, country-style.}
{132}{}{我被一瓶酒牵着鼻子走，酒里夹杂着一根棍子上的鬣蜥，乡村风格。}
#{133}{}{I don't know. The question is beyond me.}
{133}{}{我不知道。我无法回答这个问题。}
#{134}{}{Are you willing to sacrifice your life to save other people?}
{134}{}{你愿意牺牲自己的生命去拯救别人吗？}
#{135}{}{I need to know what kind of people they are first. If they're worthy and there's no other choice - then yes.}
{135}{}{我要先知道他们是什么样的人。如果他们是值得的，没有其他选择-那么是的。}
#{136}{}{I want to devote my life to help people, willing to sacrifice myself saving them.}
{136}{}{我想用我的一生去帮助人们，愿意牺牲自己去拯救他们。}
#{137}{}{Most people in the world aren't worth my kind of sacrifice.}
{137}{}{世界上大多数人都不值得我做出这种牺牲。}
#{138}{}{I can sacrifice my left boot. That should be difficult, but I can try.}
{138}{}{我可以牺牲我的左靴子。那应该很难，但我可以试试。}
#{139}{}{I don't know. I could only answer that in the moment.}
{139}{}{我不知道。我现在只能回答这个问题。}
#{140}{}{What do you want most in this life? Wealth, glory, family... Or, maybe, to save the world?}
{140}{}{你这辈子最想要什么？财富，荣誉，家庭。。。或者，也许，为了拯救世界？}
#{141}{}{My first priority is always to survive. Everything else comes after that.}
{141}{}{我的首要任务永远是生存。其他的都在那之后。}
#{142}{}{I want to save everyone I can.}
{142}{}{我想拯救所有我能救的人。}
#{143}{}{I don't need to make up some higher goals for my life.}
{143}{}{我不需要为我的人生设定更高的目标。}
#{144}{}{Can I have all of the above? No? Then, I suppose, I'll get... Something jazzy. And some popcorn to go with it.}
{144}{}{我能把上面所有的都给你吗？不？那么，我想，我会。。。一些爵士音乐。还有一些爆米花。}
#{145}{}{The choice is tough.}
{145}{}{选择是艰难的。}
#{146}{}{In your opinion, what's the worst of all human vices?}
{146}{}{在你看来，人类最坏的恶习是什么？}
#{147}{}{Greed.}
{147}{}{贪婪。}
#{148}{}{Pride.}
{148}{}{骄傲。}
#{149}{}{Betrayal.}
{149}{}{背叛。}
#{150}{}{The proximity of having the belly button.}
{150}{}{接近肚脐。}
#{151}{}{Well, they're all pretty bad in their own way.}
{151}{}{嗯，他们都有自己的缺点。}
#{154}{}{How can I help you?}
{154}{}{我能帮你什么？}
#{155}{}{Nothing for today.}
{155}{}{今天没什么。}
#{156}{}{You wanted to ask me some questions, right?}
{156}{}{你想问我一些问题，对吗？}
#{157}{}{Oh, yes. If you don't mind.}
{157}{}{哦，是的。如果你不介意的话。}
#{158}{}{Good. Let's get started.}
{158}{}{很好。我们开始吧。}
#{159}{}{I've changed my mind.}
{159}{}{我改变主意了。}
#{160}{}{[He nods approvingly] You know the price of things. You know the path you walk. But not everything in this world has a number. Be ready for a puzzle that cannot be solved.}
{160}{}{[他赞许地点头]你知道东西的价格。你知道你走的路。但并不是所有的东西都有数字。为无法解决的难题做好准备。}
#{161}{}{[He nods approvingly] You've devoted your life to your fellow man. Many of them won't do you the same courtesy. Some day it might kill you... Or save you.}
{161}{}{[他赞许地点头]你把你的生命献给了你的同胞。他们中的许多人不会对你有同样的礼貌。总有一天它会杀了你。。。或者救你。}
#{162}{}{[He nods approvingly] You know your worth. And when the right time comes, you'll make the world earn it.}
{162}{}{[他赞许地点头]你知道你的价值。当合适的时候，你会让全世界都知道的。}
#{163}{}{[He nods approvingly] You believe in tomorrow. And it will come, with us or without us.}
{163}{}{[他赞许地点头]你相信明天。不管有没有我们，它都会来的。}
#{164}{}{[He nods approvingly] It's hard to make a choice ahead of time, isn't it? You must prefer to choose on a case-by-case basis. Many people think the world is black and white, but the truth is that there is no truth. You can't know the right answer until you've seen the question for yourself.}
{164}{}{[他赞许地点头]很难提前做出选择，不是吗？你一定喜欢根据具体情况来选择。许多人认为世界是黑白的，但事实是没有真相。在你亲眼看到这个问题之前，你不可能知道正确的答案。}
#{165}{}{Sorry if that was tiresome. I just wanted to know what kind of person you are.}
{165}{}{抱歉，如果那很烦人的话。我只是想知道你是什么样的人。}
#{166}{}{Ugh, that's fine.}
{166}{}{呃，没关系。}
#{170}{}{I want to know more about you. Care to tell?}
{170}{}{我想多了解你。想告诉我吗？}
#{171}{}{Sure. My name is Patrick, I'm from Salt Lake City - a big city far to the east. Our Mormon community has sent me here to preach the word of God. It's been hard, but I'm not going to give up.}
{171}{}{当然。我叫帕特里克，我来自盐湖城――一个远离东方的大城市。我们的摩门教派我来这里宣讲上帝的道。这很难，但我不会放弃。}
#{172}{}{I've seen that type of jumpsuit before. Are you from a vault?}
{172}{}{我以前见过那种连身衣。你是金库的吗？}
#{173}{}{}
{173}{}{}
#{174}{}{Why would your community send you to such a dangerous city?}
{174}{}{你的社区为什么要把你送到这么危险的城市？}
#{175}{}{Do you preach to those prostitutes downstairs, too?}
{175}{}{你也对楼下的妓女说教吗？}
#{176}{}{What are you doing here, exactly?}
{176}{}{你到底在这里干什么？}
#{177}{}{Sure.}
{177}{}{当然。}
#{178}{}{}
{178}{}{}
#{179}{}{Another question, please.}
{179}{}{请再问一个问题。}
#{180}{}{Enough about you and your missionary work. Let's change the subject.}
{180}{}{关于你和你的传教工作已经够了。我们换个话题吧。}
#{181}{}{Right. But I have to go.}
{181}{}{正确的。但我得走了。}
#{182}{}{No, no, I was born after our people left the shelter. There is a vault on city's outskirts, but no one has been there in years. This jumpsuit is a... Keepsake from my grandfather. He served the vault, but when the bombs came, he refused to hide away from God's world. He said he wouldn't, or couldn't, bear the gray walls and enclosed space without a single ray of God's light. That's all I know about him - he was dead long before I was born.}
{182}{}{不，不，我是在我们的人离开庇护所后出生的。市郊有一个金库，但已经好几年没人去过了。这件连身衣是。。。我祖父的信物。他为金库服务，但当炸弹到来时，他拒绝躲开上帝的世界。他说如果没有上帝的一缕光，他不会，也不能，忍受灰色的墙壁和封闭的空间。我只知道他-他早在我出生前就死了。}
#{183}{}{}
{183}{}{}
#{184}{}{This is our tradition. Every one of us must spend two years preaching the gospel of God. I could have chosen another path or denied it entirely, but I didn't. The people here need salvation as much as anyone else.}
{184}{}{这是我们的传统。我们每个人都要用两年的时间来传讲上帝的福音。我本可以选择另一条路，或者完全否认，但我没有。这里的人和其他人一样需要拯救。}
#{185}{}{Do not blame the people here. They are surviving the only way they know how. That's why I'm here - to open their eyes. You may not believe it, but some of them have converted already.}
{185}{}{别怪这里的人。他们以他们知道的唯一方式生存。这就是我来这里的原因-打开他们的眼睛。你可能不相信，但有些人已经皈依了。}
#{186}{}{Oh, many things. Besides praying, preaching, and gathering old books, I teach children to write, lead an anonymous support group, and just help whoever I can.}
{186}{}{哦，很多事情。除了祈祷、布道和收集旧书之外，我还教孩子们写作，领导一个匿名支持小组，尽我所能帮助任何人。}
#{190}{}{I want to donate $100 to your cause.}
{190}{}{我想捐100美元给你的事业。}
#{191}{}{That's very generous of you! Every dollar goes to help people in need, and may just save someone's life. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!}
{191}{}{你真慷慨！每一块钱都用来帮助有需要的人，而且可能只会挽救一个人的生命。从心底感谢你！}
#{192}{}{You're welcome.}
{192}{}{不客气。}
#{193}{}{That's enough trouble out of you!}
{193}{}{你的麻烦够多了！}
#{200}{}{I'm interested in your support group.}
{200}{}{我对你们的支持小组很感兴趣。}
#{201}{}{I understand your curiosity, but you don't need it, believe me. This group is to help people who cannot help themselves. [he smiles] I don't know much about you, but I can tell you're the farthest thing from that.}
{201}{}{我理解你的好奇心，但你不需要，相信我。这个团体是为了帮助那些不能自救的人。[他笑着说]我对你了解不多，但我能看出你是最远的。}
#{202}{}{Is Harding in your group?}
{202}{}{哈丁在你们组吗？}
#{203}{}{I... See. I suppose if you know, there's no point in denying it. But I won't say another word about it. Rule number one is: what happens in the group, stays in the group. This is a sensitive matter. If we violate each other's trust, many of our members will be left with nothing.}
{203}{}{一、 。。。看。我想如果你知道的话，否认是没有意义的。但我不会再说一个字了。第一条规则是：小组里发生的事，留在小组里。这是个敏感问题。如果我们违反了彼此的信任，我们的许多成员将一无所有。}
#{204}{}{Perhaps we can talk about something else?}
{204}{}{也许我们可以谈点别的？}
#{205}{}{Tell me about these group meetings. What are you trying to do?}
{205}{}{告诉我这些小组会议的情况。你想干什么？}
#{206}{}{I'm sorry, but I don't think you'd understand. Do you know what psychiatry is?}
{206}{}{对不起，我想你不会明白的。你知道什么是精神病学吗？}
#{207}{}{Let me guess - group psychotherapy, right? You sit around in circle and start brainwashing each other.}
{207}{}{让我猜猜-集体心理治疗，对吧？你们围成一圈，开始互相洗脑。}
#{208}{}{That's... Not far from the truth. I'm surprised! How do you... I suppose I should be happy to have a colleague in front of me. Medical knowledge is hard to find in this city. Where did you learn this?}
{208}{}{那是。。。离真相不远。我很惊讶！你怎么。。。我想我应该很高兴有一个同事在我面前。医学知识在这个城市很难找到。你从哪里学来的？}
#{209}{}{Life experience, Patrick. Life experience.}
{209}{}{人生经历，帕特里克。生活经历。}
#{210}{}{Amazing! May God bless you. Your gift can do great things in the wasteland!}
{210}{}{太神了！愿上帝保佑你。你的天赋可以在荒地里做大事！}
#{211}{}{Maybe. But about your support group...}
{211}{}{也许 吧。但是关于你的支持小组。。。}
#{212}{}{Of course. I'm always ready to share experience with my colleague.}
{212}{}{当然。我随时准备与同事分享经验。}
#{213}{}{How many people come to this support group?}
{213}{}{有多少人参加这个支持小组？}
#{214}{}{Just a few. Even three is enough for our group therapy. Some come only once and never visit again. Right now there's about ten permanent members.}
{214}{}{就几个。对于我们的团体治疗来说，三个就足够了。有些人只来过一次就再也不来了。现在大约有十个常任理事国。}
#{215}{}{Another question.}
{215}{}{另一个问题。}
#{216}{}{What's wrong with these people?}
{216}{}{这些人怎么了？}
#{217}{}{These people can't handle the stresses of society. Most of them suffer from anxiety or similar conditions, and society preys on them. The most common metaphor in our group is of rabbits living in a world of wolves.}
{217}{}{这些人承受不了社会的压力。他们中的大多数人患有焦虑症或类似的疾病，社会对他们进行掠夺。我们组最常见的比喻是兔子生活在狼的世界里。}
#{218}{}{How are trying to "cure" Harding?}
{218}{}{你是如何试图“治愈”哈丁的？}
#{219}{}{I'm trying to teach him to deal with his insecurities. Society won't accept him, so he must learn to accept himself.}
{219}{}{我在教他如何处理不安全感。社会不会接受他，所以他必须学会接受自己。}
#{220}{}{Has Harding always been like this?}
{220}{}{哈丁一直都是这样吗？}
#{221}{}{From childhood, I think. He won't talk about it, but I suspect sexual abuse by his parents. I know he's always been an outcast and found refuge in books. It hasn't been good for his social development.}
{221}{}{我想是从童年开始的。他不会说的，但我怀疑是他父母的性侵犯。我知道他一直是个被遗弃的人，在书中找到了避难所。这对他的社会发展不利。}
#{222}{}{How has Harding survived with this condition?}
{222}{}{哈丁是如何在这种情况下幸存下来的？}
#{223}{}{He thinks he's the lowest of society, so he takes the lowest jobs - watching brahmin, cleaning toilets, that sort of thing. Any community, even Reno, needs people to do these things.}
{223}{}{他认为自己是社会最底层的人，所以他从事最底层的工作――看婆罗门，打扫厕所，诸如此类的事情。任何社区，甚至雷诺，都需要人们来做这些事情。}
#{224}{}{I don't agree with your choice of Harding's treatment.}
{224}{}{我不同意你选择哈丁的治疗方法。}
#{225}{}{What do you mean?}
{225}{}{什么意思？}
#{226}{}{You're trying to suppress his phobia by making him comfortable as an outcast, but I think he needs more attention and communication.}
{226}{}{你试图通过让他成为一个被遗弃的人来抑制他的恐惧症，但我认为他需要更多的关注和交流。}
#{227}{}{This could be dangerous. Society's bullied him for a long time - no one knows what could be buried within his scarred conscience. I wanted to give him peace instead of exposing him to more stress.}
{227}{}{这可能很危险。社会欺负了他很长一段时间――没人知道他伤痕累累的良心里埋着什么。我想让他平静下来，而不是让他承受更大的压力。}
#{228}{}{What about medication?}
{228}{}{药物呢？}
#{229}{}{I still thinking about it. For now, I have another question.}
{229}{}{我还在想。现在，我还有一个问题。}
#{230}{}{I've been thinking about that lately. He need something to calm his nerves and suppress the worries.}
{230}{}{我最近一直在想这个。他需要一些东西来安抚他的神经和抑制忧虑。}
#{231}{}{Pre-war anti-smoker was used to suppress anxiety. Maybe that will help.}
{231}{}{战前的反吸烟被用来抑制焦虑。也许这会有帮助。}
#{232}{}{I still think he has to improve his social confidence.}
{232}{}{我仍然认为他必须提高他的社会信心。}
#{233}{}{I'm not an expert, so I'll trust in your knowledge and the will of God. But I don't have any chems. The local dealers might be able to help, but they'll undoubtedly demand a high price.}
{233}{}{我不是专家，所以我相信你的知识和上帝的意志。但我没有任何化学物质。当地的经销商也许能帮上忙，但他们无疑会要求很高的价格。}
#{234}{}{I'll see what I can do.}
{234}{}{我看看我能做什么。}
#{235}{}{I'm not an expert, so I'll trust in your knowledge and the will of God. If Harding is going to conquer his fears, he'll have to overcome his sexual trauma... I don't like the idea, but maybe the sex workers in Reno can help you.}
{235}{}{我不是专家，所以我相信你的知识和上帝的意志。如果哈丁要克服他的恐惧，他必须克服他的性创伤。。。我不喜欢这个主意，但也许雷诺的性工作者能帮你。}
#{236}{}{I don't agree. I don't know why.}
{236}{}{我不同意。我不知道为什么。}
#{237}{}{It's useful to follow your instincts sometimes, but we can't take risks in this case. Don't forget, we're talking about the well-being of another man's soul.}
{237}{}{有时跟随你的直觉是有用的，但在这种情况下我们不能冒险。别忘了，我们在谈论另一个人的灵魂幸福。}
#{238}{}{I'll think about it and get back to you.}
{238}{}{我会考虑一下再给你回电。}
#{240}{}{What can you tell me about the situation in the city?}
{240}{}{你能告诉我这个城市的情况吗？}
#{241}{}{As we speak, the Satan lures people of this city deeper in his cobwebs of civil war.}
{241}{}{正如我们所说的，撒旦在内战的蛛网中引诱着这个城市的人们。}
#{242}{}{In your opinion, why can't the people here live peacefully?}
{242}{}{在你看来，为什么这里的人不能和平地生活？}
#{243}{}{That's a good question. The most part of my home, Salt Lake City, was destroyed by the thirteen nuclear strikes, so it took a lot of time and a lot of work to rebuild. But Reno and its people retained all of the gifts of the old world.}
{243}{}{这是个好问题。我的家盐湖城的大部分被十三次核打击摧毁了，所以重建需要大量的时间和工作。但雷诺及其人民保留了旧世界的所有礼物。}
#{244}{}{The irony is, the devastation of Salt Lake City built strong families and communities, as people had to work together. Here, people fell victim to their own selfishness.}
{244}{}{具有讽刺意味的是，盐湖城的毁灭建立了强大的家庭和社区，人们不得不共同努力。在这里，人们成为自己自私的牺牲品。}
#{245}{}{Everyone tried to take from each other, caring only about themselves. AS a result, you won't find bright doctors, educators, or other people here. And because of that, this society has no future. The people can only fight for what's left over from earlier years.}
{245}{}{每个人都试图从对方身上夺走，只关心自己。因此，你在这里找不到聪明的医生、教育家或其他人。正因为如此，这个社会没有未来。人民只能为早年留下的东西而战。}
#{246}{}{[Next]}
{246}{}{[下一步]}
#{247}{}{If the local gangs go to war, which of them will you support?}
{247}{}{如果当地帮派开战，你会支持哪一个？}
#{248}{}{Gangs? That isn't just about gangs, my friend. There are people behind them with their own politics and ideas of how to lead the city. They know that, even in this place, they can't just take what they want. There's only so many resources, and if they become too greedy today, there won't be anything for them tomorrow. That's why the people choose sides - they see them as having a plan for the future. But I don't think either of them are on the right path.}
{248}{}{帮派？我的朋友，这不仅仅是帮派的问题。他们背后有自己的政治和如何领导城市的想法。他们知道，即使在这个地方，他们也不能随心所欲。只有这么多的资源，如果他们今天变得太贪婪，明天就什么也没有了。这就是为什么人们选择站在一边――他们认为他们对未来有计划。但我认为他们两个都没有走上正确的道路。}
#{249}{}{Thank you for explanation.}
{249}{}{谢谢你的解释。}
#{250}{}{Can I help your mission in some way?}
{250}{}{我能帮你完成任务吗？}
#{251}{}{Are you serious? It brings joy to my soul to know someone wants to help.}
{251}{}{你是认真的吗？知道有人想帮助我，我的灵魂就会感到快乐。}
#{252}{}{ Right now, I have two problems. Itchie has a serious arm injury, and I can't get my long-waited package from home.}
{252}{}{现在，我有两个问题。伊奇的胳膊受了重伤，我不能从家里拿到我等了很久的包裹。}
#{253}{}{ Right now, the biggest problem is Itchie's bullet wound. I can't do anything for him.}
{253}{}{现在，最大的问题是伊奇的枪伤。我不能为他做任何事。}
#{254}{}{ Right now my main concern is that I can't get my long-waited package from home.}
{254}{}{现在我最担心的是我不能从家里拿到等待已久的包裹。}
#{255}{}{I will take care of him.}
{255}{}{我会照顾他的。}
#{256}{}{I will look into your package.}
{256}{}{我会检查你的包裹。}
#{257}{}{ But no, that's alright. I don't need anything right now.}
{257}{}{但不，没关系。我现在什么都不需要。}
#{258}{}{He was rummaging through some trash bin when a firefight broke out around him. He was shot in the arm and it's become infected. All I could do is give him all painkillers I had. If you are a doctor, can you help?}
{258}{}{他正在翻垃圾桶，突然周围发生了一场交火。他手臂中枪，感染了。我所能做的就是给他所有的止痛药。如果你是医生，你能帮忙吗？}
#{259}{}{I'll help.}
{259}{}{我会帮忙的。}
#{260}{}{I can help, but medication costs money.}
{260}{}{我可以帮忙，但药物要花钱。}
#{261}{}{Ah, I'm sorry. I thought you were offering charity, not paid services. Let's see... I only have 100 dollars. Will that be enough?}
{261}{}{啊，对不起。我以为你提供的是慈善，不是有偿服务。让我们看看。。。我只有100美元。够了吗？}
#{262}{}{I'll deal with the patient and get back to you.}
{262}{}{我会处理好病人，然后给你回电。}
#{263}{}{That's very good! I hope for the best.}
{263}{}{太好了！我希望一切顺利。}
#{264}{}{Good news! I've treated Itchie's injury.}
{264}{}{好消息！我治疗过瘙痒的伤。}
#{265}{}{}
{265}{}{}
#{266}{}{That's great news! This is the last of my money, but it's worth it to help him.}
{266}{}{这是个好消息！这是我最后一笔钱，但帮助他是值得的。}
#{267}{}{No, you need the money more than I do.}
{267}{}{不，你比我更需要钱。}
#{268}{}{Hand it over.}
{268}{}{把它交出来。}
#{269}{}{That's great news! Thank you for your kindness. May the Lord bless you.}
{269}{}{这是个好消息！谢谢你的好意。愿上帝保佑你。}
#{270}{}{You're welcome.}
{270}{}{不客气。}
#{271}{}{That's great news! Thank you for your kindness. May the Lord bless you.}
{271}{}{这是个好消息！谢谢你的好意。愿上帝保佑你。}
#{272}{}{Hey, who's going to pay me? This cost me 100 bucks!}
{272}{}{嘿，谁来付钱给我？这花了我100块钱！}
#{273}{}{Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were offering charity, not paid services. Alright, I have 100 dollars left. I hope it's enough, for it's all I have.}
{273}{}{哦，对不起。我以为你提供的是慈善，不是有偿服务。好吧，我还剩100美元。我希望这足够了，因为这是我的全部。}
#{274}{}{Give it to me.}
{274}{}{把它给我。}
#{275}{}{Glad to help.}
{275}{}{很乐意帮忙。}
#{280}{}{Every month, my brothers in Salt Lake City send me a package via the Nevada Express containing a message and supplies. This time, the courier - a boy from the slums - never arrived. The Nevada Express employee told me that they gave it to him, and they have no reason to risk their reputation for whatever supplies were in the package.}
{280}{}{每个月，我在盐湖城的兄弟们都会通过内华达快递给我寄一个包裹，里面有信息和用品。这一次，信使-一个来自贫民窟的男孩-从未到达。内华达快递公司的员工告诉我，他们把它给了他，他们没有理由为了包裹里的任何物资而拿自己的声誉冒险。}
#{281}{}{[Next]}
{281}{}{[下一步]}
#{282}{}{I figure the supplies are gone. I don't blame the people in the slums for that; given their circumstances, I can only hope they got to someone in need. But the message... It's important to me. Please, try to find it.}
{282}{}{我想补给品不见了。我不怪贫民窟里的人；考虑到他们的情况，我只能希望他们能找到需要帮助的人。但是信息。。。这对我很重要。求你了，试着找到它。}
#{283}{}{I'll see what I can do.}
{283}{}{我看看我能做什么。}
#{284}{}{About your message...}
{284}{}{关于你的信息。。。}
#{285}{}{Did you find it? I really need it.}
{285}{}{你找到了吗？我真的需要它。}
#{286}{}{Here you go.}
{286}{}{干得好。}
#{287}{}{How did you lose it again?}
{287}{}{你怎么又丢了？}
#{288}{}{Every month, my brothers in Salt Lake City send me a package via the Nevada Express containing a message and supplies. This time, the courier - a boy from the slums - never arrived. All I need is the message. Talk to the Nevada Express employee or the courier.}
{288}{}{每个月，我在盐湖城的兄弟们都会通过内华达快递给我寄一个包裹，里面有信息和用品。这一次，信使-一个来自贫民窟的男孩-从未到达。我需要的只是信息。和内华达快递公司的员工或快递员谈谈。}
#{289}{}{You really did it! That's amazing! I'm afraid I can't pay you, but I thank you from the bottom of my heart. You don't know how important these instructions are for my work here.}
{289}{}{你真的做到了！太神奇了！恐怕我付不起你钱，但我衷心感谢你。你不知道这些指示对我在这里的工作有多重要。}
#{290}{}{What is this message, anyway?}
{290}{}{这是什么信息？}
#{291}{}{I wish you the best. Good luck.}
{291}{}{我祝你一切顺利。祝你好运。}
#{292}{}{Yeah, bye.}
{292}{}{好的，再见。}
#{293}{}{[He reads the message] Hmm. The Community offers me to return to Salt Lake City. But I can't! The people of Reno need me more now than ever. I have to stay.}
{293}{}{[他读了留言]嗯，社区让我回盐湖城。但我不能！雷诺人民现在比以往任何时候都更需要我。我必须留下来。}
#{294}{}{That's very honorable of you. Well, good luck.}
{294}{}{你真是太光荣了。好吧，祝你好运。}
#{295}{}{If you say so. As for me, it's time to move on. Goodbye.}
{295}{}{如果你这样说。对我来说，是时候继续前进了。再见。}
#{296}{}{Yes, I have a delicate request. The message you brought to me included an old movie on holodisk. I want to organize film screening for the locals at night, but I'm afraid Mr. Wright will not allow me. Would you convince him to allow me a showing?}
{296}{}{是的，我有一个微妙的要求。你给我带来的信息包括全息光盘上的一部旧电影。我想在晚上为当地人组织电影放映，但恐怕赖特先生不允许。你能说服他让我表演一下吗？}
#{297}{}{I'll do it. I'll talk to Wright.}
{297}{}{我会的。我去找赖特。}
#{298}{}{Thank you. I will await his answer.}
{298}{}{非常感谢。我将等待他的回答。}
#{299}{}{Later.}
{299}{}{以后再说。}
#{300}{}{I would like to know more about that movie first.}
{300}{}{我想先多了解一下那部电影。}
#{301}{}{Of course! What do you want to know?}
{301}{}{当然！你想知道什么？}
#{302}{}{I need to talk to you about the movie.}
{302}{}{我要和你谈谈这部电影。}
#{303}{}{What kind of movie is it?}
{303}{}{这是什么类型的电影？}
#{304}{}{What's so important about it?}
{304}{}{有什么重要的？}
#{305}{}{Why are you so concerned about Wright's opinion?}
{305}{}{你为什么这么关心赖特的意见？}
#{306}{}{That's all.}
{306}{}{这就是全部。}
#{307}{}{It's a pre-war movie about the greed and vice of humanity. The mail idea is that the sins of the world brought about its destruction... I know it won't mean anything for a lot of people, but if it will allow me to save one soul, it will have been worth it. Mormons have been using it for this purpose since before the war, and missionaries like myself always show it at the end of their mission. No one in Reno has seen it yet, or so I assume.}
{307}{}{这是一部关于人类贪婪和邪恶的战前电影。邮件的意思是世界的罪恶导致了它的毁灭。。。我知道这对很多人来说毫无意义，但如果它能让我拯救一个灵魂，那就值得了。摩门教徒从战前就开始使用它来达到这个目的，像我这样的传教士总是在任务结束时展示它。里诺还没人见过，或者我猜是这样。}
#{308}{}{The people in Reno have no awareness of their past and no hope for their future. This movie could give that to them. Besides, most locals have never seen any sort of movie at all before. This may help them understand our faith more and drive them to the path of God.}
{308}{}{雷诺的人们对自己的过去一无所知，对未来也没有希望。这部电影可以给他们这样的感觉。此外，大多数当地人以前从未看过任何类型的电影。这可以帮助他们更了解我们的信心，并驱使他们走上神的道路。}
#{309}{}{He owns the slums, and in essence, the people within them. If Wright doesn't approve of the movie, he may shut it down or take even more drastic action. It simply can't happen without his permission.}
{309}{}{他拥有贫民窟，本质上是贫民窟里的人。如果赖特不赞成这部电影，他可能会关闭它或采取更激烈的行动。没有他的允许，这根本不可能发生。}
#{310}{}{Wright gave you permission to show the movie, but he said he won't be responsible for your security.}
{310}{}{赖特允许你放映这部电影，但他说他不会对你的安全负责。}
#{311}{}{I see... I understand. I had hoped we would have his protection, but I don't blame him.}
{311}{}{我懂了。。。我理解。我本希望我们能得到他的保护，但我不怪他。}
#{312}{}{Would this be dangerous? Why would someone attack a movie showing?}
{312}{}{这会很危险吗？为什么会有人攻击电影放映？}
#{313}{}{I'm afraid some people in the city do not approve of my preaching. They could be disruptive... Or perhaps, violent. Listen, I may be asking too much, but... Would you help me?}
{313}{}{恐怕城里有些人不赞成我的讲道。它们可能是破坏性的。。。或者，暴力。听着，我可能要求太多了，但是。。。你能帮我吗？}
#{314}{}{I'll get prepared and let you know when I'm ready.}
{314}{}{我会准备好的，准备好了就告诉你。}
#{315}{}{You don't have to worry about Wright anymore - he's dead.}
{315}{}{你不用再担心赖特了-他死了。}
#{316}{}{That is sad news. I fear what may happen to the slums now, but that means we are needed now more than ever before. It will make the movie showing more dangerous, too.}
{316}{}{这是个不幸的消息。我担心贫民窟现在会发生什么，但这意味着我们现在比以往任何时候都更需要我们。这也会让电影放映更危险。}
#{317}{}{We can show the movie now. }
{317}{}{我们现在可以放映这部电影了。}
#{318}{}{Are you sure you're ready? We'll have to show it outside the city, and won't have time to go back if we forget anything. Take anything you might need.}
{318}{}{你确定你准备好了吗？我们必须把它展示在城外，如果我们忘了什么，就没有时间回去了。带上你可能需要的任何东西。}
#{319}{}{Let's go.}
{319}{}{走吧。}
#{320}{}{Actually, you're right. I'll be back soon.}
{320}{}{实际上，你是对的。我很快就回来。}
#{321}{}{It's good to see you well after our big night.}
{321}{}{很高兴在我们的重要夜晚之后见到你。}
#{322}{}{You're still in one piece! How was the movie?}
{322}{}{你还是完好无损！电影怎么样？}
#{323}{}{Everyone was in awe! Women cried, men were happy. Although, I don't think it was the movie itself that did it so much as the opportunity to enjoy something they'd never seen before. They have so few pleasures here, and even fewer with no dangerous consequences following them. I think they'll talk about this for a long time. Thank you! None of this would have been possible if not for you!}
{323}{}{大家都很敬畏！女人哭了，男人高兴了。不过，我不认为这是电影本身做了这么多的机会，享受他们从未见过的东西。他们在这里很少有乐趣，甚至更少，没有任何危险的后果。我想他们会谈论这个很久的。谢谢您！如果不是你，这一切都不可能！}
#{324}{}{All's well that ends well.}
{324}{}{结局好就好。}
#{325}{}{From here, these people must walk the path of God themselves. Again, thank you for everything. I hope you will continue to help the people here... They need it.}
{325}{}{从这里，这些人必须自己走上帝的路。再次感谢你所做的一切。我希望你能继续帮助这里的人们。。。他们需要它。}
#{326}{}{Good luck, Patrick.}
{326}{}{祝你好运，帕特里克。}
#{327}{}{Helping the Mormon missionary has improved your karma and your reputation in the slums.}
{327}{}{帮助摩门教传教士改善了你的业力和你在贫民窟的名声。}
#{330}{}{Say, you don't have a sniper rifle, do you?}
{330}{}{你没有狙击步枪吧？}
#{331}{}{Me?! No, I'm a peaceful person. The only weapon I carry is for self-defense.}
{331}{}{我？！不，我是个平和的人。我唯一携带的武器是自卫用的。}
#{332}{}{Then how do you explain the ammo shell on your balcony? It seems to line up with the recent shooting on the street.}
{332}{}{那你怎么解释阳台上的弹壳？这似乎与最近在街上发生的枪击事件相符。}
#{333}{}{Oh... I see. Listen, that day a family asked to stay here. They looked like they were from out of town and the husband had a strange-looking briefcase with him. I had no idea they were assassins! Do you think Stryker hired them?}
{333}{}{哦。。。我懂了。听着，那天一家人要求留在这里。他们看起来像是从外地来的，丈夫随身带着一个奇怪的公文包。我不知道他们是刺客！你觉得史崔克雇了他们吗？}
#{334}{}{Hard to say, but your story sounds convincing. And you really don't have a rifle. Thanks for the information.}
{334}{}{很难说，但你的故事听起来很有说服力。你真的没有来复枪。谢谢你的消息。}
#{1110}{}{[The young man smiles at you, but you see sadness in his eyes] Welcome, wanderer. My name is Patrick. Can I ask you a few questions?}
{1110}{}{[年轻人对你微笑，但你看到他眼中的悲伤]欢迎你，流浪者。我叫帕特里克。我能问你几个问题吗？}
#{1115}{}{I'm not from around here. I might not know how to answer your questions.}
{1115}{}{我不是本地人。我可能不知道怎么回答你的问题。}
#{1134}{}{Are you willing to sacrifice your life to save other people?}
{1134}{}{你愿意牺牲自己的生命去拯救别人吗？}
#{1136}{}{Yes. If I can't help others, what's the point of living at all?}
{1136}{}{对。如果我不能帮助别人，活着还有什么意义？}
#{1158}{}{Good. Let's get started.}
{1158}{}{很好。我们开始吧。}
#{1159}{}{I've changed my mind.}
{1159}{}{我改变主意了。}
#{1160}{}{[He nods approvingly] You know the price of things. You know your path. But not everything in this world has a number. Be ready for a puzzle that cannot be solved.}
{1160}{}{[他赞许地点头]你知道东西的价格。你知道你的路。但并不是所有的东西都有数字。为无法解决的难题做好准备。}
#{1208}{}{That's... Not far from the truth. I'm surprised! I suppose I should be happy to have a colleague in front of me. Medical knowledge is hard to find in this city. Where did you learn this?}
{1208}{}{那是。。。离真相不远。我很惊讶！我想我应该很高兴有一个同事在我面前。医学知识在这个城市很难找到。你从哪里学来的？}
#{1210}{}{Amazing! May God bless you. Your gift can do great things in the wasteland!}
{1210}{}{太神了！愿上帝保佑你。你的天赋可以在荒地里做大事！}
#{1236}{}{I don't agree. I don't know why.}
{1236}{}{我不同意。我不知道为什么。}
#{1266}{}{That's great news! This is the last of my money, but it's worth it to help him.}
{1266}{}{这是个好消息！这是我最后一笔钱，但帮助他是值得的。}
#{1275}{}{Glad to help.}
{1275}{}{很乐意帮忙。}
#{1314}{}{I'll get prepared and let you know when I'm ready.}
{1314}{}{我会准备好的，准备好了就告诉你。}
#{1318}{}{Are you sure you're ready? We'll have to show it outside the city, and won't have time to go back if we forget anything. Take anything you might need.}
{1318}{}{你确定你准备好了吗？我们必须把它展示在城外，如果我们忘了什么，就没有时间回去了。带上你可能需要的任何东西。}
#{1320}{}{Actually, you're right. I'll be back soon.}
{1320}{}{实际上，你是对的。我很快就回来。}
