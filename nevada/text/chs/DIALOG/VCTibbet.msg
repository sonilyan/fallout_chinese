#{100}{}{This is Paul Tibbett.}
{100}{}{我是保罗・蒂贝特。}
#{101}{}{You see a little fat owner of the trade shop.}
{101}{}{你看到一个贸易商店的胖老板。}
#{110}{}{Hey, come in, wanderer! I just looked for a good weapon for you. Wanna take a look?}
{110}{}{嘿，进来，流浪汉！我只是想给你找个好武器。想看看吗？}
#{111}{}{Hey, come in, wanderer! I just was looking for a solid armor for your travels in the wilderness. Would you like to try it?!}
{111}{}{嘿，进来，流浪汉！我只是在为你的野外旅行寻找一件坚固的盔甲。你想试试吗？！}
#{112}{}{Hey, come in, wanderer! I was just thinking, what would a client such as you, need? Take a look - perhaps, you'll find something useful.}
{112}{}{嘿，进来，流浪汉！我在想，像你这样的客户需要什么？看看吧，也许你会发现一些有用的东西。}
#{113}{}{[Upon entering the shop, the first thing that catches your eye is the owner, who is diligently tinkering with some kind of part. He wears a baseball cap, t-shirt, faded jeans, and has a Mexican-type slightly gray beard on his face. A walking American stereotype.]}
{113}{}{[一进店，首先映入眼帘的是店主，他正在勤勤恳恳地修补某种零件。他戴着棒球帽，穿t恤，穿着褪色的牛仔裤，脸上留着墨西哥式的浅灰色胡须。一个活生生的美国人的刻板印象。]}
#{114}{}{Ahem...}
{114}{}{啊哼...}
#{116}{}{Hey, do not rush with the decision! Today I have a real sale. You just have to admire these beautiful shiny guns! Powerful energy gun straight out of Area 51. How? Well, there were some desperate miners who managed to penetrate the facility and steal everything they could carry on their feet. But it is not so important. The important thing is that now you can choose a truly excellent weapon.}
{116}{}{嘿，别急着做决定！今天我有个大减价。你只需要欣赏这些漂亮闪亮的枪！强大的能量枪直接从51区出来。怎样？好吧，有一些绝望的矿工设法闯入工厂，偷走了他们能随身携带的一切。但这并不重要。重要的是，现在你可以选择一个真正优秀的武器。}
#{117}{}{Doesn??t sound bad.}
{117}{}{听起来不错。}
#{118}{}{Oh! Pal, I see you've already succeeded in your life, if you travel on four wheels. What does your baby runs on? Microfusion battery? Look, I can make an additional power supplies specifically for you and your beauty.}
{118}{}{哦！伙计，我看你已经成功了，如果你用四个轮子旅行的话。你的宝宝跑什么？微型聚变电池？听着，我可以为你和你的美貌做一个额外的电源。}
#{119}{}{Wow, must remember this for the future.}
{119}{}{哇，以后一定要记住这一点。}
#{120}{}{Let me look at your stuff.}
{120}{}{让我看看你的东西。}
#{121}{}{I think I entered the wrong place. Bye.}
{121}{}{我想我进错地方了。再见。}
#{122}{}{More or enough?}
{122}{}{更多还是足够？}
#{123}{}{Right, let??s take another look.}
{123}{}{好的，让我们再看看。}
#{124}{}{Uh, no, this is enough.}
{124}{}{呃，不，这就够了。}
#{125}{}{Can you answer few questions, while I??m looking?}
{125}{}{在我看的时候，你能回答几个问题吗？}
#{126}{}{I don??t sell information here, as you can see. I??m not the one you need. It is hard to get a good informant in Vegas.}
{126}{}{如你所见，我这里不卖信息。我不是你需要的人。在维加斯很难找到一个好的线人。}
#{127}{}{Maybe, you can tell me about Vegas then?}
{127}{}{也许，你可以告诉我关于维加斯的事？}
#{128}{}{Let's trade then.}
{128}{}{那我们交易吧。}
#{129}{}{Vegas! Sparkling New Vegas! The city that never sleeps. Uh... Maybe you need a shovel or a pack of contraception?}
{129}{}{维加斯！闪亮的新维加斯！不眠之城。Uh...也许你需要一把铲子或一包避孕用具？}
#{130}{}{Maybe I do, but later. And what you can do here?}
{130}{}{也许我会，但以后。你能在这里做什么？}
#{131}{}{In Vegas, there is a slew of kinds of entertainment for all tastes. But do not expect to find work. Everything here is constructed so that the money always are pulled to the Clean City and never go out.}
{131}{}{在维加斯，各种各样的娱乐活动应有尽有。但不要指望找到工作。这里的一切都是这样建造的，钱总是被拉到干净的城市，永远不会出去。}
#{132}{}{Tel me about the Clean City.}
{132}{}{告诉我关于清洁城市的事。}
#{133}{}{The fenced area in the north. Clean and comfortable, plenty of light, the police maintains order. You might want to look and see this beauty. Nowhere in this wasteland you can see anything like this. But the people who live there are not distinguished by generosity. These snobs look down to all and everyone.}
{133}{}{北部有围墙的地区。干净舒适，光线充足，警察维持秩序。你可能想看看这个美人儿。在这片荒地上你看不到这样的东西。但居住在那里的人们并不以慷慨而著称。这些势利小人瞧不起所有人。}
#{134}{}{Any other areas?}
{134}{}{还有别的地方吗？}
#{135}{}{To the west is the "Hard Rock" cafe. The area is more or less calm, but sometimes there are clashes between local gangs and street robbers. To the south of the cafe is the Slavertown. Eerie and unpleasant place, it is being run by slavers. In the east you can walk to the Hoover Dam, but it??s far. A place with spectacular views. Impressive!}
{135}{}{西边是“硬石”咖啡馆。这个地区多少有些平静，但有时也会发生当地黑帮和街头劫匪之间的冲突。咖啡馆的南面是斯莱弗敦。令人毛骨悚然和不愉快的地方，它是由奴隶主经营。在东部你可以走到胡佛大坝，但它很远。景色壮观的地方。令人印象深刻！}
#{136}{}{What else the newcomer needs to know about the city?}
{136}{}{新来的人还需要了解这个城市吗？}
#{137}{}{If you're in a Clean City, do not forget to hide the weapon in the holster, and that the local police don??t like strangers. also hide your weapon in the casino. But when outside, better keep the gun closer.}
{137}{}{如果你在一个干净的城市，别忘了把武器藏在枪套里，而且当地警察不喜欢陌生人。把你的武器藏在赌场里。但在外面的时候，最好把枪放近点。}
#{138}{}{Okay, thanks, for the help.}
{138}{}{好的，谢谢你的帮助。}
#{139}{}{Hey-hey-hey! I told you all, that your heart desired. And you leave without even buying anything?}
{139}{}{嘿嘿嘿！我告诉了你所有的，你的心所渴望的。你什么都没买就走了？}
#{140}{}{Yeah well.}
{140}{}{是的，嗯。}
#{141}{}{Indeed - this is not right. Have a 10$ tip.}
{141}{}{的确，这是不对的。给你10美元小费。}
#{142}{}{What, I??m still looking. Let??s trade.}
{142}{}{什么，我还在找。我们交易吧。}
#{143}{}{[Smiles] Thanks. Come by, when you??ll have time!}
{143}{}{[微笑]谢谢。有时间的时候过来！}
#{144}{}{Bye.}
{144}{}{再见。}
#{145}{}{In such case I have nothing to do here. Bye.}
{145}{}{在这种情况下，我在这里无事可做。再见。}
#{146}{}{}
{146}{}{}
#{147}{}{Then get out of my shop!}
{147}{}{那就离开我的店！}
#{148}{}{Your shop doesn??t look like a barn anymore. Take care.}
{148}{}{你的商店不再像谷仓了。当心。}
#{149}{}{I didn??t want to insult you, sorry. I think I??ll go.}
{149}{}{我不想侮辱你，对不起。我想我要走了。}
#{150}{}{}
{150}{}{}
#{151}{}{}
{151}{}{}
#{152}{}{New? Isn??t it a pre-war city?}
{152}{}{新的？这不是战前的城市吗？}
#{153}{}{Yes! But the greatness of gleaming pre-war city faded soon after the Great War. Now it??s a lot different. That's why I say - this is a new Vegas. The new city, an oasis in the desert. However, no one has yet realized the idea. Believe an old man, the time will come - and everyone will call it this way.}
{153}{}{对！但战后不久，这座闪闪发光的战前城市的伟大就消失了。现在情况大不一样了。这就是为什么我说-这是一个新的拉斯维加斯。新城，沙漠中的绿洲。然而，还没有人意识到这个想法。相信一个老人，时间会到来的，每个人都会这样称呼它。}
#{154}{}{You're doing the right thing, to trust me. Now let's take a look at the goods...}
{154}{}{相信我，你做得对。现在让我们来看看商品...}
#{158}{}{You have such a wide assortment. The trade in these parts must be a very profitable business.}
{158}{}{你的产品种类这么多。这些零件的贸易一定是一项非常有利可图的生意。}
#{159}{}{Not quite... Hey, how much longer are you gonna watch? As far as I can see, it??s time to buy something.}
{159}{}{不完全是...嘿，你还要看多久？据我所知，是时候买点东西了。}
#{160}{}{Hmm, let me think: the shop in the most comfortable place, cops are not far, and you are selling guns. You??re definitely connected, right?}
{160}{}{嗯，让我想想：商店在最舒服的地方，警察不远，你在卖枪。你肯定有关系，对吧？}
#{161}{}{[Sighs] I don??t want to talk about it, but you??re too smart for a simple customer. The truth is, my main business was tied with guns, but then the Clean City started to seize all power and shops. Cops didn??t want for the weaponry to be distributed freely. That??s why I get protection and permission to work from them, and in return, I send every good weapon to Clean City's armory. Such is the agreement. But remember - I told you this only because, you put me against the wall.}
{161}{}{我不想谈这个，但你太聪明了，不适合一个简单的顾客。事实是，我的主营业务与枪支捆绑在一起，但随后清洁城市开始夺取所有权力和商店。警察不想让武器自由分发。这就是为什么我得到他们的保护和工作许可，作为回报，我把每一件好武器都送到了城市的军械库。这就是协议。但是记住-我告诉你这些只是因为，你把我推到了墙边。}
#{162}{}{Really crafty bastards. You did well for yourself. Fine, bye.}
{162}{}{真是狡猾的混蛋。你做得很好。好的，再见。}
#{163}{}{Thanks to your trade skill you earned 100 experience points for uncovering the secret of Tibbett business.}
{163}{}{由于你的贸易技能，你赢得了100个经验点揭露蒂贝特的秘密业务。}
#{164}{}{You successfully used your trading skills and got access to a secret Tibbett selection. But be warned, this was only just for this one time.}
{164}{}{你成功地使用了你的交易技巧，并获得了一个秘密提贝特选择。但请注意，这只是这一次。}
#{165}{}{Hmm... If you share your goods with cops, then you must be collecting everything special, in some secret place.}
{165}{}{Hmm...如果你和警察分享你的物品，那么你一定是在某个秘密的地方收集所有特别的东西。}
#{166}{}{This is only for the privileged... That means for the representatives of the Clean City. I don??t think that I will risk selling this to strangers. The reputation with the Clean City is more important for me.}
{166}{}{这只给特权阶层...这对清洁城市的代表来说意味着。我不认为我会冒险把这个卖给陌生人。清洁城市的名声对我来说更重要。}
#{167}{}{You say that, because you cannot be sure in your business partner. I can understand you very well. I have seen so many traders myself. Think over my candidacy.}
{167}{}{你这么说是因为你不能确定你的生意伙伴。我能很好地理解你。我自己也见过很多交易者。考虑一下我的候选资格。}
#{168}{}{I knew for some reason, you'll say that.}
{168}{}{我知道是因为什么原因，你会这么说。}
#{169}{}{[Thinks] You??re not a usual customer, right? Such skills as yours are a rare find. I respect your business - that why I??ll trust you. Okay, here I stashed this for the cops. If you need some of it, you can buy it. Just don??t tell anyone, that you bought it of me.}
{169}{}{你不是普通的顾客，对吧？像你这样的技能是很少见的。我尊重你的生意，所以我相信你。好吧，我给警察藏了这个。如果你需要一些，你可以买。别告诉任何人，是你买的。}
#{170}{}{Hey, do you have anything special for my ride?}
{170}{}{嘿，我的车有什么特别的吗？}
#{171}{}{Hmm, let me think. I don??t have anything, except batteries, but I??m sure you can find something at my old pal. Ex-mechanic, he used to be called Skitter, until he... Underwent ghoulification. Terrible story. The locals don??t like ghouls here, that??s why he lives not far from Vegas - he decided to isolate himself in a tire dump, when he became sick of people.}
{171}{}{嗯，让我想想。我什么都没有，除了电池，但我相信你能在我的老朋友那里找到一些东西。前机械师，他以前叫斯基特，直到他...接受了尸检。可怕的故事。当地人不喜欢这里的食尸鬼，这就是为什么他住在离维加斯不远的地方――当他厌倦了人的时候，他决定把自己隔离在一个轮胎垃圾场。}
#{172}{}{Why didn??t you say that in the first place! Great, tell me, where is your friend.}
{172}{}{你当初为什么不这么说！太好了，告诉我，你的朋友在哪里。}
#{173}{}{It??s not far from Vegas, to the north-east. Though, I can??t remember the exact coordinates, getting old. But, the smell of money can bring my memory back.}
{173}{}{它离维加斯不远，在东北部。不过，我记不清确切的坐标了，老了。但是，钱的味道能让我回忆起来。}
#{174}{}{How about a trade? You do certainly need fresh goods...}
{174}{}{交易怎么样？你确实需要新鲜货...}
#{175}{}{Hmm... Cash would be better, and the goods will stay on a shelf for a long time, until a buyer will come. Look - I'll write down the coordinates on holodisk, and you come, when you find something useful to exchange.}
{175}{}{Hmm...现金会更好，货物会在货架上停留很长时间，直到买家来。听着-我会把坐标写在全息磁盘上，当你找到有用的东西交换时，你就来了。}
#{176}{}{Ok, let??s trade then.}
{176}{}{好吧，那我们交易吧。}
#{177}{}{Then I can do without your services, you extortionist.}
{177}{}{那我就不用你了，你这个敲诈者。}
#{178}{}{Ha! You'll break your legs running around looking for it. But, it??s your business - whether you look by yourself in the whole wasteland, relying on your scouting skills, or just to pay me for the exact coordinates. Just saying.}
{178}{}{哈！你跑来跑去找它会摔断你的腿的。但是，这是你的事――不管你是依靠你的侦察技术，还是仅仅为了支付我精确的坐标，一个人在整个荒地里寻找。只是说说而已。}
#{179}{}{My choice is obvious. I'll manage without you.}
{179}{}{我的选择是显而易见的。没有你我也能应付。}
#{190}{}{What is that helm that you got for sale?}
{190}{}{你卖的那个头盔是什么？}
#{191}{}{Well, lately, strange things started to appear. They say, some brave souls began looting in the north-west - there, where the aliens come from. People are not all right in the head. But I only benefit from this.}
{191}{}{最近，奇怪的事情开始出现了。他们说，一些勇敢的灵魂开始抢劫西北部-那里，外星人来自。人们的头脑不好。但我只从中受益。}
#{192}{}{Okay. That is all I was interested in. Bye.}
{192}{}{可以。这就是我所感兴趣的。再见。}
#{200}{}{[With amazement, he looks at the pizza in your hands, then at the clock] Boy, you??re slower than a brahmin wagon, loaded with old junk. Where were you all this time? You??re late. So you can carry it back to the cafe and to declare my dismissal. I'm not going to pay.}
{200}{}{[他惊奇地看着你手里的比萨饼，然后看着钟]孩子，你比一辆满载旧垃圾的双头牛马车还慢。你一直在哪里？你迟到了。所以你可以把它带回咖啡馆，宣布我被解雇。我不会付钱的。}
#{201}{}{[Leave]}
{201}{}{[离开]}
#{202}{}{Pizza! Just in time, give it here, now I'll get even with it, he-he.}
{202}{}{披萨！及时，给我，现在我要报复了，他。}
#{203}{}{Sure, sir. here. You owe }
{203}{}{当然可以，先生。在这里。你欠我的}
#{204}{}{$.}
{204}{}{$.}
#{205}{}{Er, how much?}
{205}{}{呃，多少钱？}
#{206}{}{$ for pizza and 10$ for delivery... Is there a problem, sir?}
{206}{}{披萨10美元，送货10美元...有什么问题吗，先生？}
#{207}{}{Well, actually, when I made the order for delivery it was 5$, so... Do you mind? [gives the money and stretches to the pizza]}
{207}{}{好吧，事实上，我订送货单的时候是5美元，所以...你介意吗？[把钱交给披萨店]}
#{208}{}{Sure, sir. The deal was 5$, then there you have it. Have a nice day!}
{208}{}{当然可以，先生。成交价是5美元，那你就有了。祝您有个美好的一天！}
#{209}{}{No way. The delivery is *10$*! Either you pay, or I??ll take the order.}
{209}{}{不可能。送货价是10美元！要么你付钱，要么我来点菜。}
#{210}{}{Thank you, courier! It is pleasant to deal with such executive employees, as in Phillips'. Tell him I said hello.}
{210}{}{谢谢你，信使！与这样的高管打交道很愉快，就像菲利普斯那样。告诉他我打过招呼。}
#{211}{}{Have a nice day!}
{211}{}{祝您有个美好的一天！}
#{212}{}{Oh, sure. I will certainly look in to it, and at the same time ask, when you have made an order... To revise the pricing policy in your respect.}
{212}{}{哦，当然。我一定会留意的，同时问一下，你什么时候下单...修改你方的价格政策。}
#{213}{}{[Frowning and looking nervous, counts 5$] Okay, okay, just don??t think, that I will forget that.}
{213}{}{[皱眉，看起来很紧张，算5美元]好吧，好吧，只是别想，我会忘记的。}
#{214}{}{[Frowning and looking nervous, counts the money] You think, I would lie, huh? You want to tell me, that I??m some thief, if I forgot about 5$? Fuck, I have the best shop in the whole Vegas! Ah, what can I say, you??re just a courier.}
{214}{}{[眉头紧锁，神情紧张，数着钱]你觉得我会撒谎吗？你想告诉我，如果我忘了5块钱，我就是个小偷吗？妈的，我有整个维加斯最好的店！啊，我能说什么，你只是个信使。}
#{215}{}{Sir, I assure you - I didn??t had anything in mind like that. You look like a respectable person! I would never suspect, that you could lie. Really!}
{215}{}{先生，我向你保证-我没有那样的想法。你看起来像个受人尊敬的人！我决不会怀疑你会撒谎。真正地！}
#{216}{}{[Leave]}
{216}{}{[离开]}
#{217}{}{[Grins the edge of the mouth and corrects buttons at the collar] Well, yes, I know... Do not worry, I'm too nervous today, so forget it. Next time I will specify the price before ordering. Good luck, and... Take care, courier.}
{217}{}{[嘴边咧嘴笑着纠正衣领上的纽扣]嗯，是的，我知道...别担心，我今天太紧张了，算了吧。下次订购前我会详细说明价格。祝你好运，还有...保重，信使。}
