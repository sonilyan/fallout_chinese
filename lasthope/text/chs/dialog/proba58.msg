{100}{}{You see: the leader of the local militia.}
{101}{}{He emanates authority, and has a strange glint in his eye. Clearly a man with a vision.}
#
{102}{}{Hey, I'm Derek, you must be new here... Just the guy I was looking for. Are you interested in a job, it pays
 well?}
#
{103}{}{OK, tell me about this job.}
{104}{}{Who's asking?}
{105}{}{Sorry, not interested.}
#after 103 and 104
{106}{}{Let me tell you something about us. We have a little organization, partially military, but all members are
 volunteers. Our only goal is the protection of our town. We're fighting gangs, raiders, mutants... Anyone who wants to
 disturb the peace we've made here. We have been successful so far and we even have more people joining us.
 But there's a problem... We don't have enough guns, so I'll need help to get us more hardware.}
#
{107}{}{Alright, what do you need?}
{108}{}{What do I get for this?}
{109}{}{Sorry, I'm a busy man.}
#
{110}{}{Well, we need both medical and weapon supplies... Say fifteen stimpaks and ten hunting rifles. You
 might wanna try asking Quincy, he sells guns and such. His shop is north from here.}
{111}{}{Not so fast, first we need fifteen stimpaks and ten hunting rifles. Try Quincy's place, he's north of here. When
 you deliver me those, I'll give you $5000 as your reward.}
#
{112}{}{OK. I'm on it.}
{113}{}{Fine, I'm off.}
#
{114}{}{Did you get some supplies for us?}
{115}{}{Yes, here they are.}
{116}{}{Nope.}
#
{117}{}{Nice... [Looking at the guns.] Good work, pal... Here's some money for the job. If you want to earn some
 more come back later, you'll find me right here.}
#
{118}{}{Sure will. Bye.}
#
{119}{}{Hey, I have another mission for you. Are you interested?}
#
{120}{}{Tell me about it.}
{121}{}{Nope.}
#
{122}{}{There's an organization... They call themselves "Bulls". I've never really paid any attention to them, but two
 days ago one of my men told me that they are smuggling grenades into their base. More weapons usually means more
 trouble for everyone. You must convince them to turn those over, that is in the best interest of all the people living in
 this town. Do you think you can convince them?}
#
{123}{}{I'll see what I can do.}
{124}{}{Wait a sec! Did you really think I would just walk in there, with all those guns inside?}
{125}{}{No, I don't think I'm ready for this.}
#after 124
{126}{}{I hope it won't come to any trouble. If they try something funny, come back and report it, understood!?}
#
{127}{}{Got it.}
#
{128}{}{What news do you bring me?}
#
{129}{}{I managed to get most of their equipment, so they will not be a threat anymore.}
{130}{}{I killed them all. Problem solved. They are no longer dangerous.}
{131}{}{Still in progress.}
#
{132}{}{Excellent, that's exactly what I would've done myself. You've done a great job. Here's something for you.
 [Gives you a gun.] And some money.}
{133}{}{Hey, thanks!}
#
{134}{}{You fool! What you did was very reckless and... stupid! I don't want to have any business with you anymore.
 Get out of here now!}
{135}{}{Whatever, I'm going.}
{136}{}{You bastard, get away from me...}
# dobra reakcija
{137}{}{Nice work, friend! I owe you.}
{138}{}{No more trouble, thanks to you.}
{139}{}{You'll always be welcome here.}
# losa reakcija
{141}{}{You are no good here!}
{142}{}{Go back to your own hell!}
{143}{}{No place for you to stay here!}
{144}{}{I don't want to see you again.}
#after 129
{145}{}{That's great, but I don't see you carrying any grenades. Come back when you have them.}
{146}{}{...?!... Must have dropped them...}
