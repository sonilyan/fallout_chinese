### {100}{}{You see a settler.}
{100}{}{你看到一个定居者。}
### {101}{}{Here is an ordinary resident of the Aqueduct.}
{101}{}{这是渡槽的一位普通居民。}

### {200}{}{Is it too late for a visit?}
{200}{}{现在去拜访太晚了吗？}
### {201}{}{I'm just...}
{201}{}{我只是...}
### {202}{}{Away! Away!}
{202}{}{离开离开}
### {203}{}{Okay, man. We'll talk in the afternoon.}
{203}{}{好吧，伙计。我们下午再谈。}

### {210}{}{Eh? I don't have time to talk. You should talk to Garth or one of the local bums.}
{210}{}{呃？我没有时间说话。你应该和加思或当地的流浪汉谈谈。}
### {211}{}{Eh? I don't have time to talk. Find someone who has nothing to do.}
{211}{}{呃？我没有时间说话。找一个无所事事的人。}
### {212}{}{I had no idea that Garth was behind all these disappearances. Now I understand why he forbade meddling in the catacombs of the aqueduct. But on the other hand, who will protect us from unwanted roommates now?}
{212}{}{我不知道加思是所有这些失踪事件的幕后黑手。现在我明白了他为什么禁止干预输水管道的地下墓穴。但另一方面，现在谁会保护我们免受不想要的室友的伤害？}
### {213}{}{Hey, Ranger. How are you?}
{213}{}{嘿，游骑兵。你好吗}
### {214}{}{Goodbye.}
{214}{}{再见}

### {220}{}{What are you doing?}
{220}{}{你在干什么？}
### {221}{}{I'm getting ready for a big fishing trip on the reservoir. And this is a troublesome business, you know.}
{221}{}{我正准备去水库钓鱼。你知道，这是一件麻烦的事。}
### {222}{}{Who built this aqueduct?}
{222}{}{谁建造了这条输水管道？}
### {223}{}{To be honest, I don't know myself. Perhaps it was the Rangers themselves. In any case, these structures have been standing here since time immemorial.}
{223}{}{老实说，我不了解自己。也许是游骑兵队自己。无论如何，这些建筑自古以来就矗立在这里。}
### {224}{}{What do you think about Garth?}
{224}{}{你觉得加思怎么样？}
### {225}{}{A good man, solid and incorruptible. He stands behind our people like a mountain and has helped many times in protecting them from bandits, robbers and animals. He lives in the house opposite.}
{225}{}{一个好人，坚韧不拔。他像一座山一样站在我们人民的身后，并多次帮助保护他们免受土匪、强盗和动物的袭击。他住在对面的房子里。}
### {226}{}{How do you live in these parts under the protection of rangers?}
{226}{}{你是如何在护林员的保护下生活在这些地方的？}
### {227}{}{Life is great. The Rangers protect us from bandits and beasts. And we pay them for it with part of our food. I have no complaints against the Rangers.}
{227}{}{生活是伟大的。游骑兵保护我们免受土匪和野兽的袭击。我们用我们的一部分食物来支付他们。我对游骑兵队没有任何抱怨。}
### {228}{}{What do you know about the disappearances of people?}
{228}{}{你对失踪人员了解多少？}
### {229}{}{Obviously, they were animals. Along the river valley there are wolves and vile pig rats. And outsiders often do not know about this danger.}
{229}{}{很明显，它们是动物。沿着河谷有狼和卑鄙的猪鼠。局外人往往不知道这种危险。}
### {230}{}{They say you have an epidemic here?}
{230}{}{他们说你这里有流行病？}
### {231}{}{Yes, suddenly several people have come down with a fever. Some managed to recover, and some are still suffering from extreme heat. In the hut opposite, one is suffering right now.}
{231}{}{是的，突然有几个人发烧了。有些人设法康复了，有些人仍在忍受酷热。在对面的小屋里，一个人正在受苦。}

### {240}{}{The Garage City community sent me. There is an acute shortage of food.}
{240}{}{车库城社区派我来的。食物严重短缺。}
### {241}{}{Hmm. They say this city is full of specialists in working with iron. And we just need parts at least for boat repairs. But they also say that the residents are not particularly friendly to the rangers. The problem of hunger there must be really terrifying if they are ready to "give up".}
{241}{}{嗯。他们说这个城市到处都是铁的专家。我们只需要零件，至少是修理船的零件。但他们也表示，当地居民对护林员并不特别友好。如果他们准备“放弃”，那里的饥饿问题一定非常可怕。}
### {242}{}{Do you agree?}
{242}{}{你同意吗？}
### {243}{}{I have yet to convince the Rangers to give their consent for the trade. But this case smacks of too much profit, they are unlikely to refuse. Yes, I would send a caravan with dried fish to this disgusting and smelly town.}
{243}{}{我还没有说服流浪者队同意这笔交易。但这起案件带有太多利润的意味，他们不太可能拒绝。是的，我会派一个带着干鱼的大篷车去这个又恶心又臭的小镇。}
### {244}{}{People are starving in the Garage, and you're already rubbing your hands in anticipation of the benefits. Think about it.}
{244}{}{人们在车库里挨饿，而你已经在摩拳擦掌，期待着福利。想想看。}
### {245}{}{OK, I'll give your consent to Garage City.}
{245}{}{好的，我会同意车库城。}
