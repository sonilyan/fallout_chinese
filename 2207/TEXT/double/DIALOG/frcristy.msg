### {10}{}{[Your gaze involuntarily moves from a pretty high-cheekboned face to a luxurious, despite the dust that's covering it, shock of red hair.

But I somehow knew from the start, that you didn't come here for our heads.}
{10}{}{[你的目光不由自主地从一张高高的颧骨脸转向了一张奢华的红发，尽管上面覆盖着灰尘。一件短袖夹克和一件灰色衬衫露出了她凹陷的肚子。破洞牛仔裤很好地突出了她的纤细双腿。]嘿。。。你吓死弗雷德了！但不知怎么的，我从一开始就知道，你来这里不是为了我们的头脑。 -- [Your gaze involuntarily moves from a pretty high-cheekboned face to a luxurious, despite the dust that's covering it, shock of red hair.

### {120}{}{[Her face becomes clouded and she hugs her shoulders as if freezing in a gust of cold wind] Fred and his then-bastard-friends attacked our settlement. We haven't had many able men that could fight... That's when all sort of fun things like beheadings and disembowelings started to happen. Together with other girls, I was brought over to the pens, where they thoroughly explained what awaits us, in every explicit detail... Then suddenly something exploded, everyone started to panic. The next thing I see is Fred getting me out, pulling me along and getting away from there with him. And that's mostly it.}
{120}{}{[她的脸变得模糊，她拥抱着她的肩膀，好像在一阵风中冻僵了]弗雷德和他当时的混蛋朋友袭击了我们的定居点。我们没有多少有能力的人可以战斗。。。就在那时，各种有趣的事情开始发生，比如斩首和开膛。我和其他女孩一起被带到围栏前，在那里，她们详细地解释了等待我们的是什么。。。然后突然有什么东西爆炸了，大家都开始恐慌起来。我看到的下一件事是弗雷德把我带出去，拉着我，然后和他一起离开那里。大部分就是这样。 -- [Her face becomes clouded and she hugs her shoulders as if freezing in a gust of cold wind] Fred and his then-bastard-friends attacked our settlement.

### {130}{}{[She smiles nonchalantly and shrugs] I don't even know. All I remember is a desolate wasteland beyond Radius. All the entertainment we had was betting whether we would die of hunger or boredom. Every day was the same, endless barren land before my eyes... before we decided to settle down in some place. That's where I understood that living in the wastes was not the worst thing that can happen to you.}
{130}{}{[她淡然一笑，耸耸肩]我甚至不知道。我只记得半径之外的一片荒凉的荒原。我们所有的娱乐都在打赌我们是会死于饥饿还是无聊。每一天都是一样的，在我眼前是一望无际的贫瘠土地。。。在我们决定在某个地方定居之前。这就是我明白生活在垃圾堆里并不是发生在你身上最糟糕的事情。 -- [She smiles nonchalantly and shrugs] I don't even know.

### {140}{}{[She chuckles, rubbing her snubby nose] You wish! Of course I am grateful to him for saving me, but... It's not like he is a bad guy... He is alright - apart from being very jumpy, of course. If he keeps going like this, he's gonna have real problems with handling his tool, if you catch my drift. Still... It's easier to survive together, so I'm stuck with him. As long as I can stand him, at least.}
{140}{}{[她轻笑着，揉着她那被冷落的鼻子]你愿意！我当然很感激他救了我，但是。。。他并不是一个坏人。。。他很好，当然除了非常神经质。如果他继续这样下去，如果你明白我的意思，他在处理工具时会遇到真正的问题。还一起生活更容易，所以我和他在一起。至少只要我能忍受他。 -- [She chuckles, rubbing her snubby nose] You wish! Of course I am grateful to him for saving me, but... It's not like he is a bad guy... He is alright - apart from being very jumpy, of course.

### {150}{}{[Seeing you enter, she runs outside where you hear her cheer. Upon returning, she shows you a severed finger of an Onca Devil] I'll take this as a souvenir. Man, I wish I had such nails... Thank you, you really helped us out. Too bad not everyone in Radius are such courageous guys like you [hearing this Fred winces, like if he was in pain, and with a sullen face begins to furiously polish his gun with the lining of his jacket.]}
{150}{}{[看到你进去，她就跑到外面，你可以听到她的欢呼声。回来后，她给你看一根被砍下的安大略魔鬼的手指]我会把它作为纪念品。伙计，我真希望我有这样的指甲。。。谢谢你，你真的帮了我们。遗憾的是，不是Radius的每个人都像你一样勇敢[听到这句话，弗雷德退缩了，好像他很痛苦，一张闷闷不乐的脸开始用夹克衬里疯狂地打磨他的枪。 -- Seeing you enter, she runs outside where you hear her cheer. Upon returning, she shows you a severed finger of an Onca Devil] I'll take this as a souvenir. Man, I wish I had such nails... Thank you, you really helped us out.

### {170}{}{[As you are trying to leave, Christie stands in your way and grabs your hand] Wait a minute, tough guy, slow down. Do you even understand what you and this genius did just now? The mines were the only protection from Onca Devils, and - you know - there are lots of them outside, judging by the howling, especially after the sunset! Could you, at least help us make it through this night? [Fred wants to say something, looking delighted, but she doesn't let him] I don't even want to hear it! Maybe we will leave this place, but not now when these creatures can tear us to pieces on the first mile on out! It's good that some of us are able to actually think with their heads!}
