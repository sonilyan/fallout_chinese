{139}{}{不要介意。让我们重新开始。}
#{140}{}{Hmm, I've seen some big metal thingy somewhere, around three floors high. I don't remember where though, and you can't see it from here. Go bug the savages to the south. One of them ought to know.}
{140}{}{嗯，我在某个地方见过一些大金属，大约三层楼高。我不记得在哪里了，从这里你看不到。把野人带到南方去。其中一个应该知道。}

#{213}{}{I don't have the same reputation in Reno as your "guys".}
{213}{}{我在里诺的名声和你们的“伙计们”不一样。}
#{214}{}{Hmm... I didn't think of that. Fine, listen up. He hung around the center of town and dealt with us in the El Dorado basement. Here's the list of shit we got from him. Last deal, he gave us poison instead.}
{214}{}{隐马尔可夫模型。。。我没想到。好吧，听着。他在市中心闲逛，在埃尔多拉多地下室和我们打交道。这是我们从他那里得到的垃圾清单。最后一笔交易，他给了我们毒药。}
#{215}{}{What basement?}
{215}{}{什么地下室？}
#{216}{}{The basement under the El Dorado casino. That's where they've got the fight ring. We usually make deals in crowds like that to keep everyone honest, but I guess it didn't work. Fucking guy.}
{216}{}{埃尔多拉多赌场地下室。那就是他们的拳击场。我们通常在这样的人群中做交易，以保持每个人的诚实，但我猜这不起作用。他妈的家伙。}
#{217}{}{How will I know when I see him?}
{217}{}{我怎么知道什么时候见到他？}
#{218}{}{We call him Solomon. He's got a ring, shaped like a skull, on his middle finger. He uses it like a brass knuckle.}
{218}{}{我们叫他所罗门。他的中指上戴着一枚头骨形状的戒指。他用它就像用铜指节。}
#{219}{}{Can you tell me anything else to help me find him?}
{219}{}{你能告诉我还有什么能帮我找到他的吗？}
#{220}{}{I don't think he's from Reno. We asked the local dealers and nobody knows him. He must have blown into town for some reason, I just don't know which.}
{220}{}{我想他不是里诺人。我们问了当地的经销商，没人认识他。他一定是因为什么原因飞来的，我不知道是哪个。}
#{221}{}{That'll do.}
{221}{}{那就行了。}
#{222}{}{You got another clue about the dealer.}

#{239}{}{What is that, a trick question? I cook and make booze for the gang. What does it look like?}
{239}{}{那是什么，一个骗人的问题？我为那帮人做饭和酿酒。它看起来像什么？}
#{240}{}{What, the boss giving you the silent treatment? It's bad out there. People are traveling in groups now, and everyone's got a gun. Raiding's getting tough. I've really got to work to keep a place in the gang. If it weren't for those fucking Indians, we'd really be in trouble.}
{240}{}{什么，老板给你沉默的待遇？外面很糟糕。现在人们成群结队地旅行，每个人都有枪。突袭越来越难了。我真的得工作才能在帮派中占有一席之地。如果不是那些该死的印第安人，我们真的会有麻烦。}

#{242}{}{Our brahmin. Any time we need food or girls, we head down south and help ourselves. But Big Louie has some other deal going on with them. He says we can't take too much or they'll starve or whatever, and then we get anything from them. So, we try not to get too greedy.}
{242}{}{我们的婆罗门。任何时候我们需要食物或女孩，我们就去南方自助。但是大路易和他们还有别的事。他说我们不能吃太多，否则他们会饿死，然后我们从他们那里得到任何东西。所以，我们尽量不要太贪心。}

{243}{}{别逼我了，混蛋！}
#{244}{}{Push me and I'll piss on you! I'm fucking serious.}

#{245}{}{Has the gang been here for long?}
{245}{}{那帮人来这里很久了吗？}
#{246}{}{I dunno, I've only been here two years. But they say it's the oldest gang in the region. Everyone knows us and fears us.}
{246}{}{我不知道，我才来这儿两年。但他们说这是该地区最古老的帮派。每个人都认识我们，都害怕我们。}
#{247}{}{Can you tell me anything about these parts?}
{247}{}{你能告诉我这些零件的情况吗？}
#{248}{}{You trying to piss me off? Forget it, just listen. This is our base, but we're all over. We've even got our own people in Reno - Stryker and Thompson. If you're ever down there, stay away from them unless you're with us. Along the way there's that village full of Indians. We get some good shit from them - they're too scared to fight us but they don't want to leave, so they pretty much have to do what we say.}
{248}{}{你想惹我生气？算了，听着。这是我们的基地，但我们都完了。我们在雷诺-史崔克和汤普森都有自己的人。如果你在下面，除非你和我们在一起，否则离他们远点。沿途有一个满是印第安人的村庄。我们从他们那里得到了一些好东西-他们太害怕了，不敢和我们打架，但他们不想离开，所以他们必须照我们说的去做。}
#{249}{}{What can you tell me about Big Louie?}
{249}{}{关于大路易你能告诉我什么？}
#{250}{}{Know any local secrets?}
{250}{}{知道当地的秘密吗？}
#{251}{}{The boss? People like him are to be feared and respected. That means you don't talk about them.}
{251}{}{老板？像他这样的人是值得敬畏和尊敬的。那意味着你不谈论他们。}
#{252}{}{Yeah, I got one. For 100 bucks I'll tell it to you.}
{252}{}{是的，我有一个。100块钱我就告诉你。}
#{253}{}{Take it, brother. You have my attention!}
{253}{}{拿着，兄弟。我注意到你了！}
#{254}{}{I don't think I want to know that badly.}
{254}{}{我想我不是很想知道。}
#{255}{}{Yeah, I got one. For 50 bucks I'll tell it to you.}
{255}{}{是的，我有一个。50块钱我就告诉你。}
#{256}{}{Uh-huh... [he sniffs the paper and crumples the edge of the dollar to see if it's fake] We found some dipshit in the wastes and brought him here to have fun in the ring. We locked him in the basement, but he somehow broke the lock, took some dynamite out of the storage and got out through the tunnels, while we were running around looking for him. Our lookout eventually saw him in the north ruins and shot him a couple of times. We've never found the body, though, so if you happen to come across it, everything he's got on him is yours.}
{256}{}{啊哈。。。[他嗅了嗅纸，揉了揉美元的边缘，看看是不是假的]我们在垃圾堆里发现了一些垃圾，把他带到这里来，在拳击场上玩。我们把他锁在地下室，但他不知怎的打破了锁，从仓库里拿出一些炸药，穿过隧道出来，而我们正在四处寻找他。我们的了望员最终在北方的废墟上看到了他，并朝他开了几枪。不过，我们还没找到尸体，所以如果你碰巧发现，他身上的所有东西都是你的。}
#{257}{}{Fine, we'll see.}
{257}{}{好吧，我们拭目以待。}
#{260}{}{What do you know about Balder?}
{260}{}{你对巴尔德了解多少？}
#{261}{}{He's fucking scum. He was our contact in Reno, but our last meeting was a setup. He led our guys into an ambush and got a lot of good men killed. Why, I don't know - I don't think it was just money. But no one's seen him since. Some guys say he's still holed up in Reno, but I dunno. Where else would he go?}
{261}{}{他他妈的是人渣。他是我们在里诺的联络人，但我们上次的会面是有预谋的。他带领我们的人埋伏，杀了很多好人。为什么，我不知道-我不认为这只是钱。但从那以后没人见过他。有人说他还躲在雷诺，但我不知道。他还会去哪里？}
#{262}{}{Right.}
{262}{}{正确的。}
