#{100}{}{You see the quartermaster.}
{100}{}{你看到军需官了。}
#{101}{}{You see the quartermaster looking at you with a smirk.}
{101}{}{你看到军需官傻笑着看着你。}
#{110}{}{[Lazily sighs and crosses his fingers on the stomach] Well, I'm listening.}
{110}{}{[懒洋洋地叹了口气，用手指在肚子上交叉着]好吧，我在听。}
#{111}{}{Let's trade.}
{111}{}{我们交易吧。}
#{112}{}{As you wish. I'm leaving.}
{112}{}{如你所愿。我要走了。}
#{113}{}{I am the official representative of the Nuka-Cola factory, and I have a very profitable proposition for you!}
{113}{}{我是努卡可乐厂的官方代表，我有一个非常有利可图的提议给你！}
#{114}{}{Very nice, but I'm not the one to talk about it.}
{114}{}{很好，但不是我说的。}
#{115}{}{Uh... But who is then?!}
{115}{}{Uh...但那是谁？！}
#{116}{}{General Wesker. He runs the Wind of War, that's him who you should address. You will have to pass through sentries to the base, go up to the North until you stop at the barricade, then enter the headquarters building to the right. Inform the guards about why you came.}
{116}{}{韦斯克将军。他有战争之风，你应该称呼他。你必须通过哨兵到达基地，向北走，直到你在路障处停下，然后进入右边的总部大楼。告诉警卫你为什么来。}
#{117}{}{Okay.}
{117}{}{可以。}
#{118}{}{I found a stone with the coat of arms on it. You know what is it?}
{118}{}{我发现一块上面有纹章的石头。你知道是什么吗？}
#{119}{}{[With bulging eyes he explores the stone for some time] You know, I won't tell you what it is, but I'll buy it. I can only say that you *definitely* can't make any use of it.}
{119}{}{[他瞪大眼睛探索这块石头一段时间]你知道，我不会告诉你它是什么，但我会买下它。我只能说你肯定不能利用它。}
#{120}{}{Hmm, what confidence. And what is the price?}
{120}{}{嗯，多自信啊。价格是多少？}
#{121}{}{Two hundred.}
{121}{}{两百。}
#{122}{}{I'll think about your offer.}
{122}{}{我会考虑你的提议。}
#{123}{}{Okay. Let's exchange.}
{123}{}{可以。我们交换吧。}
#{124}{}{What is there to think about? For you it's a useless piece of stone. And I'll even pay for it a little. *Who else* will buy a piece of stone?}
{124}{}{有什么好考虑的？对你来说这是一块无用的石头。我甚至会付一点钱。*还有谁会买一块石头？}
#{125}{}{Fair enough, let's exchange.}
{125}{}{很公平，我们交换吧。}
#{126}{}{Hmm, isn't there a catch? Perhaps, I will not hurry with the exchange.}
{126}{}{嗯，不是有陷阱吗？也许，我不会急着去交换。}
#{127}{}{Careful! He can roll away into some crevice!}
{127}{}{小心！他可以滚到裂缝里去！}
#{128}{}{Don't worry! I'll bring it back...}
{128}{}{别担心！我会把它拿回来...}
#{129}{}{Here is the money. By the way, if you find the second one, also carry it to me, okay?}
{129}{}{这是钱。顺便说一句，如果你找到第二个，也拿给我，好吗？}
#{130}{}{Okay.}
{130}{}{可以。}
#{131}{}{I decided to sell you this piece of stone. Here.}
{131}{}{我决定把这块石头卖给你。在这里。}
#{132}{}{I have found the second stone! Will you buy it?}
{132}{}{我找到第二块石头了！你会买吗？}
#{133}{}{Well, thank you!}
{133}{}{好吧，谢谢你！}
#{134}{}{You are welcome... Although it's all somehow strange. I have a feeling that something very important has been hidden from me. Goodbye.}
{134}{}{不客气...尽管有些奇怪。我觉得有件很重要的事瞒着我了。再见。}
#{135}{}{Do you have *special* weapons for *special* price?}
{135}{}{你们有特价武器吗？}
#{136}{}{Heh... Funny. All the *special* weaponry is stocked in the base warehouses, and here is only the most primitive. Our boss is no fool, he realizes that sold weapons could be used directly against us, so it's the other way around - that's him who is buying "special weapons for special prices". Got it?}
{136}{}{嘿...好笑。所有的特种武器都存放在基地仓库里，这里只有最原始的。我们的老板不是傻瓜，他意识到出售的武器可以直接用来对付我们，所以情况正好相反――就是他在以“特价”购买特殊武器。知道了？}
#{137}{}{As if you can't take something from the warehouse. [wink]}
{137}{}{好像你不能从仓库里拿东西似的。[眨眼]}
#{138}{}{Okay.}
{138}{}{可以。}
#{139}{}{Well... I can [leans towards you and lowers his voice] get some plasma grenades. Small loss, no one will notice. And as for the rest - I'll pass. It is dangerous.}
{139}{}{好...我可以[向你倾斜并降低声音]拿一些等离子手榴弹。小损失，没人会注意到。至于其他的-我不说了。这很危险。}
#{140}{}{I agree on the grenades. How much time do you need?}
{140}{}{我同意手榴弹。你需要多少时间？}
#{141}{}{No, I do not need this.}
{141}{}{不，我不需要这个。}
#{142}{}{Two days and 2500 bucks. It's expensive, considering the actual cost of the grenades, but the risk is on me and I have to share with others, you know what I'm saying?}
{142}{}{两天2500美元。考虑到手榴弹的实际成本，这很贵，但风险在我身上，我必须和其他人分担，你知道我在说什么吗？}
#{143}{}{That's 1000, you'll get the rest when the product is ready.}
{143}{}{那是1000，等产品准备好了你就可以拿到剩下的了。}
#{144}{}{Never mind then.}
{144}{}{那没关系。}
#{145}{}{Don't mess with me. I don't like this kind of jokes.}
{145}{}{别惹我。我不喜欢这种笑话。}
#{146}{}{Okay.}
{146}{}{可以。}
#{147}{}{Very well, that's fair. I'll do it. The box will be yours, but not earlier than in two days.}
{147}{}{很好，这很公平。我会的。这个盒子是你的，但不能早于两天。}
#{148}{}{All right.}
{148}{}{好吧。}
#{149}{}{Well, what about my order?}
{149}{}{那我点的菜呢？}
#{150}{}{I have it... In a special place. No one will find. Where's my money?}
{150}{}{我有...在一个特别的地方。谁也找不到。我的钱呢？}
#{151}{}{Here 1500.}
{151}{}{这里1500。}
#{152}{}{I'll go get the money.}
{152}{}{我去拿钱。}
#{153}{}{A good deal, but I won't dare to do it again. It wasn't easy.}
{153}{}{好交易，但我不敢再做了。这并不容易。}
#{154}{}{Okay.}
{154}{}{可以。}
#{155}{}{You sell mainly household items. What about drinks? Is there, for instance, a bar or a cafe?}
{155}{}{你们主要卖家居用品。喝点什么？比如说，有酒吧还是咖啡馆？}
#{156}{}{No. We have the dining room but keep it for us to use, the newcomers are by themselves. Basically all we need we get with caravans. They usually stop here on the way between Vegas and Reno.}
{156}{}{没有。我们有餐厅，但留着用，新来的人自己住。基本上我们需要的都是大篷车。他们通常在拉斯维加斯和雷诺之间的路上停在这里。}
#{157}{}{Basically? So you're still missing something?}
{157}{}{基本上？你还缺什么？}
#{158}{}{Funny that you're asking. Our guys from the barracks sometimes come here to look for a bit of the "liquid joy", but caravans usually don't transport such drinks through the Wasteland.}
{158}{}{你这么问真有趣。我们军营的人有时会来这里寻找一点“液体的乐趣”，但商队通常不会运输这种饮料通过荒地。}
#{159}{}{So, the warriors need alcohol?}
{159}{}{那么，战士们需要酒精吗？}
#{160}{}{I would take a batch of, say, 30 bottles of beer... At a higher price.}
{160}{}{我要一批，比方说，30瓶啤酒...以更高的价格。}
#{161}{}{30 bottles of beer... Will write it down to not forget.}
{161}{}{30瓶啤酒...会记下来不忘的。}
#{162}{}{I got a box of beer.}
{162}{}{我有一盒啤酒。}
#{163}{}{That's great! How it foams! [quickly hides the box of bottles] Okay, here's the money. And one more thing - don't talk about it. We've got some pedantic bookworms here, you know. [Makes a nasty face and waves his hand in a sign of contempt]}
{163}{}{太好了！怎么会有泡沫！[快把瓶子藏起来]好的，钱来了。还有一件事-别谈了。你知道，我们这儿有些书呆子。[恶作剧，挥手表示蔑视]}
#{164}{}{OK.}
{164}{}{好 啊。}
#{165}{}{You've brought the promised to the customer.}
{165}{}{你已经把承诺带给顾客了。}
#{166}{}{I can count! No need to lie to me!}
{166}{}{我会数数！不用骗我！}
#{167}{}{Oops, sorry.}
{167}{}{哦，对不起。}
#{168}{}{Maybe I can, but with the suck-ups like you, you never know what might happen. Maybe you will run to our General and denunciate me? I heard you're now on friendly terms with him.}
{168}{}{也许我可以，但像你这样的人，你永远不知道会发生什么。也许你会跑到我们的将军那里谴责我？我听说你现在和他关系很好。}
#{169}{}{[Suspiciously looks around] I don't know what you're talking about. All sorts of easy riders wander here - one wants grenade, another wants a grenade launcher. But you won't go far in this town doing stuff like this. So don't bother me and be content with what you see on the counter.}
{169}{}{我不知道你在说什么。各种容易骑手徘徊在这里-一个想要手榴弹，另一个想要一个手榴弹发射器。但你在这个镇上做这种事不会走太远的。所以不要打扰我，满足于你在柜台上看到的东西。}
#{173}{}{About selling Nuka-Cola. Wesker gave the nod.}
{173}{}{关于卖Nuka可乐。韦斯克点头。}
#{174}{}{Yeah, I know. Let's get straight to the details. I hope you have an established line of delivery?}
{174}{}{是的，我知道。我们直接谈细节吧。希望你们有固定的送货路线？}
#{175}{}{I can hire a caravan...}
{175}{}{我可以租一辆大篷车...}
#{176}{}{[Interrupting] Good. I don't want to have a headache selling *your* product. My job is to turn the product into profits, not to bother myself with new concerns.}
{176}{}{[打断]很好。我不想因为卖你的产品而头痛。我的工作是将产品转化为利润，而不是为新的问题困扰自己。}
#{177}{}{So that's what you all about...}
{177}{}{所以这就是你想要的...}
#{178}{}{I have enough other stuff to do without your Cola. It's not Las Vegas. On the other hand, I would love to add a new product to the stock, because it will be another reason for the Wasteland people to come to my shop. Moreover, I even know where to get a vending machine for drinks. This would optimize our cooperation.}
{178}{}{没有你的可乐我还有很多事要做。不是拉斯维加斯。另一方面，我想增加一个新产品的库存，因为这将是另一个原因，荒地的人来我的商店。此外，我甚至知道在哪里可以买到饮料自动售货机。这将优化我们的合作。}
#{179}{}{Op-ti-mi... Where do...}
{179}{}{哦，我...你在哪里...}
#{180}{}{So! [his eyes light up with thirst for potential profit] It's your burden to deliver the goods. You will load the bottles right into the machine and pick the revenue from it. I'll pick up my share myself. It's simple. Come back with Cola in a day, I'll have everything prepared.}
{180}{}{所以！[他的眼睛因对潜在利润的渴望而发亮]交货是你的负担。你将把瓶子直接装进机器，从中提取收入。我自己去拿我的那份。很简单。过一天再来拿可乐，我会准备好一切的。}
#{181}{}{I'm glad to hear it. See you.}
{181}{}{我很高兴听到这个消息。再见。}
#{216}{}{Hey, that's my stuff!}
{216}{}{嘿，那是我的东西！}
#{217}{}{For sure?! Anyway, it's not my problem - I've bought these things in an honest way. If you want to return something you have to buy it.}
{217}{}{当然？！不管怎样，这不是我的问题-我买这些东西是诚实的。如果你想退货，就得买。}
#{218}{}{Grr...}
{218}{}{Grr...}
#{220}{}{You just won't believe it! We were talking about you right now. I've heard a lot of good things about you. Our guys know and respect you. I've thought about it and decided it would be fair to lower my prices for you a little.}
{220}{}{你不会相信的！我们正在谈论你。我听过很多关于你的好消息。我们的人了解你也尊重你。我考虑过了，决定把我的价格给你降低一点是公平的。}
#{221}{}{That's nice.}
{221}{}{那很好。}
#{222}{}{Hey, you bought a car from my friend? Damn, you must have been saving for a year to do this. Look, I sell different things that might be useful in a trip. If you want to buy something - just choose, I'll give you a discount as a sign of respect!}
{222}{}{嘿，你从我朋友那里买了辆车？妈的，你一定攒了一年的钱才这么做。听着，我卖不同的东西，可能对旅行有用。如果你想买东西-随便选吧，我给你打折以示尊重！}
#{223}{}{Just great!}
{223}{}{太好了！}
#{300}{}{Where'd you all come from?}
{300}{}{你们从哪里来的？}
#{301}{}{Well, we came from a small vault, when it became crowded... Damn, I probably shouldn't have told you. In any way, if you want to snatch some technology from there, then I have to disappoint you - the shelter is inhabited by mutants, and the entrance is caved with stones. Besides, we brought out everything we could from there back then.}
{301}{}{嗯，我们从一个小避难所来，当它变得拥挤...妈的，我可能不该告诉你。无论如何，如果你想从那里获取一些技术，那么我不得不让你失望――避难所里住着变种人，入口被石头压塌了。另外，我们把当时能做的都带了出来。}
#{302}{}{}
{302}{}{}
#{303}{}{Can you take me there?}
{303}{}{你能带我去吗？}
#{304}{}{Idle curiosity, just ignore me.}
{304}{}{无所事事的好奇心，别理我。}
#{305}{}{Hell no! Sometimes around the shelters the mutants are noticed, and I don't want to meet them. However, I could show this place on the map, but of course, not just for "thank you" in return. Let's say for 300 bucks.}
{305}{}{他妈的不！有时在庇护所周围会发现变种人，我不想见到他们。然而，我可以在地图上显示这个地方，但当然，不仅仅是为了“谢谢”作为回报。比如说300美元。}
#{306}{}{Yeah, sure.}
{306}{}{是的，当然。}
#{307}{}{}
{307}{}{}
#{308}{}{}
{308}{}{}
#{309}{}{}
{309}{}{}
#{310}{}{Can you take me to the vault?}
{310}{}{你能带我去保险库吗？}
#{311}{}{Okay, I'll go to the technician.}
{311}{}{好的，我去找技术员。}
#{312}{}{All right, have it your way. That's $300, now show it.}
{312}{}{好吧，随你的便。那是300美元，现在给我看看。}
#{313}{}{I'll try to find another way. Bye.}
{313}{}{我会想办法的。再见。}
#{1118}{}{I found a stone with the coat of arms on it. Do you know what it is?}
{1118}{}{我发现一块上面有纹章的石头。你知道是什么吗？}
#{1131}{}{I decided to sell you this piece of stone. Here.}
{1131}{}{我决定把这块石头卖给你。在这里。}
#{1132}{}{I have found the second stone! Will you buy it?}
{1132}{}{我找到第二块石头了！你会买吗？}
#{1140}{}{I agree on the grenades. How much time do you need?}
{1140}{}{我同意手榴弹。你需要多少时间？}
#{1162}{}{I got a box of beer.}
{1162}{}{我有一盒啤酒。}
