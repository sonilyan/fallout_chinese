{255}{}{你怎么想的？该死！是的，冈萨雷斯向一些居民提供毒品，他们很愚蠢。但他为其他人提供治疗疾病的药物和止痛药。你为什么要杀了他？}

### {273}{}{Weren't the cardinals bandits themselves?}
{273}{}{红衣主教们自己不是强盗吗？}

### {315}{}{I'll have to tell you again.}
{315}{}{我得再告诉你一次。}
### {316}{}{We didn't kill anyone. The monks went around the residents in search of alms and, of course, left with nothing. Already on the street they were seized by masked men and strung up on lampposts. We don't know who it was. But they were clearly well prepared for the attack.}
{316}{}{我们没有杀人。僧侣们在居民周围寻找施舍，当然，他们一无所获。他们已经在街上被蒙面人抓住，绑在灯柱上。我们不知道是谁。但他们显然已经为这次袭击做好了充分准备。}

{320}{}{我们为什么要爱他们？当我们生活在贫困中时，僧侣们沐浴在奢华之中。他们拿走了我们的武器，并禁止冈萨雷斯出售药品。但看看当地人。这些穷人中会有人实施如此有组织的袭击吗？}
### {321}{}{Who is capable of such an audacious attack?}
{321}{}{谁有能力进行如此大胆的攻击？}
### {322}{}{Only the Atomists and the Orris gang. But the former always stayed away from the city. And the second hardly needs problems with the church.}

### {327}{}{Grm...}
{327}{}{Grm。。。}
### {328}{}{Stop it! Think about it, would we attack monks near our own house? It's too reckless. But there are rumors about a secret club of fire-phobes. After all, in the past, Aaron, with the help of the Church of Fire, staged a revolution and ruined the whole city. Surely many people have been wanting to take revenge on him since then.}
{328}{}{住手！想想看，我们会在自己家附近袭击僧侣吗？这太鲁莽了。但是，有传言说，有一个秘密俱乐部的消防恐惧症。毕竟，在过去，亚伦在火之教会的帮助下，发动了一场革命，毁掉了整个城市。从那以后，肯定有很多人想报复他。}
### {329}{}{A curious thought. Perhaps you deserve my mercy for today.}
{329}{}{一个奇怪的想法。也许你今天值得我怜悯。}
### {330}{}{Enough lies! I will kill you, atomic nonentity.}

### {422}{}{What are you talking about?}
{422}{}{你在说什么？}
### {423}{}{Our main headache is a gang of Red Cardinals. They, in fact, own the whole area and all its inhabitants. No one dares to go against them. Even the guild mercenaries don't want to get involved in this. Nobody cares about us, and the gang is constantly growing and putting pressure on us.}
{423}{}{我们最头疼的是一群红雀队。事实上，他们拥有整个地区及其所有居民。没有人敢反对他们。即使是公会雇佣兵也不想卷入其中。没有人关心我们，帮派不断壮大，给我们施加压力。}

{424}{}{你疯了。你知道你在问什么吗？}
### {425}{}{Please? Uh, no, I'm just complaining. Eliminating such a gang sounds fantastic. But you've already done so much for us. Do you have any ideas? Actually, we've dropped all our last caps over Orris' head here. Without him, the gang will fall apart. This will give at least some respite to us, ordinary residents.}
{425}{}{请不，我只是在抱怨。消灭这样一个帮派听起来太棒了。但你已经为我们做了这么多。你有什么想法吗？事实上，我们已经把最后的帽子都扔到了奥的头上。没有他，这帮人就会分崩离析。这至少会给我们这些普通居民一些喘息的机会。}

Neither us, nor the bandits themselves. Please spare us from his lawlessness. Besides you, no one else will want to help us.}
{433}{}{这个团伙拥有整个地区。里面有几十个人。他们知道如何打好仗，而且他们有武器。他们的领袖是奥里斯。他是个可怕的家伙，他不会让任何人失望。既不是我们，也不是土匪。请放过我们，让我们远离他的无法无天。除了你，没有人愿意帮助我们。}

{437}{}{让这些含泪的演讲见鬼去吧。开瓶车。你认为我这么冒险是出于好心吗？}
