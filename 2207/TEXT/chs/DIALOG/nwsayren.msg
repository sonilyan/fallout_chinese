### {120}{}{[Cyren's smile becomes wider] Of course. I am well-known in all of NWO! Ask my friend, Blanca, for example. She loves to tell stories about me. And everything she says is true.

{120}{}{[赛伦的笑容变得更灿烂了]当然。我在NWO都很有名！例如，问问我的朋友Blanca。她喜欢讲关于我的故事。她说的每一句话都是真的。[他停顿了一下，靠得更近了，轻声说道]我甚至没有告诉她一切，因为她不让我执行任务――这太危险了。}

#Node016
### {160}{}{That's the thing! I usually go with a partner. You know, for little help, to carry things and such. But nowadays you can't find people who are experienced at least half as much as I am.

And I had such high hopes for him...}

{170}{}{你[赛伦瞥了你一眼]不，我想你甚至都到不了目的地了！虽然你知道，我会给你一个机会。有一项简单的工作。我们的罐头几乎用完了，所以我需要一个合作伙伴来侦察锡工业的金属制品厂。我们拿几卷锡回来。}
