### {100}{}{Welcome to Golden Valley stranger. I'm sheriff Milton and with the help of my men, we're keeping things in order here. Same rules for everyone, this is no place for troublemakers. Drugs are out of the question either. If you got a problem with someone or something, you talk to me, just don't get yourself into trouble. Any questions?}
{100}{}{欢迎来到金谷陌生人。我是米尔顿警长，在我手下的帮助下，我们正在维持秩序。每个人都有同样的规则，这里不是麻烦制造者的地方。毒品也是不可能的。如果你和某人或某事有问题，你可以和我谈谈，只是不要给自己惹麻烦。有什么问题吗？}
### {101}{}{Got any job for me?}
{101}{}{有工作给我吗？}
### {102}{}{What can you tell me about this town?}
{102}{}{关于这个小镇，你能告诉我什么？}
### {103}{}{Nothing at the moment.}
{103}{}{现在什么都没有。}
### {104}{}{Talk to me when you're in better shape. It would be a shame to see you get beaten up any worse.}
{104}{}{等你身体好了再跟我说。看到你被打得更惨，那将是一种耻辱。}
### {105}{}{Sure thing, sheriff.}
{105}{}{当然，警长。}
### {106}{}{Yes, I do have something for you but I'm not sure you can handle yourself in any situation. So I have to ask about the type of job you think you can manage?}
{106}{}{是的，我确实有东西要给你，但我不确定你在任何情况下都能应付得了。所以我不得不问一下你认为你能胜任什么类型的工作？}
### {107}{}{Usually I negotiate, but if it comes down to it, I'm good with small arms. I've been practicing for quite some time.}
{107}{}{通常我会谈判，但归根结底，我擅长小武器。我已经练习了很长一段时间了。}
### {109}{}{All right then. I think I have something that needs to be taken care of. Here's what's going on. Some of the locals are complaining about a bunch of suspicious guys hanging around the old gold mine, harassing people. However, I'm more worried about some citizens who went missing and were supposedly last seen in that area. Find out what happened. You'll be working on your own for now, we don't want to draw too much attention.}
{109}{}{好吧。我想我有一些事情需要处理。事情是这样的。一些当地人抱怨一群可疑的家伙在老金矿附近徘徊，骚扰人们。然而，我更担心的是一些失踪的公民，据说他们最后一次出现在该地区。了解发生了什么。你现在将自己工作，我们不想引起太多关注。}
### {110}{}{I'm on it.}
{110}{}{我在上面。}
### {111}{}{On second thought, I'll be back when I'm ready to take the job.}
{111}{}{转念一想，当我准备好接受这份工作时，我会回来的。}
### {112}{}{About that job...}
{112}{}{关于那份工作。。。}
### {113}{}{Yes?}
{113}{}{对}
### {114}{}{I'll take it.}
{114}{}{我要它。}
### {115}{}{Okay then. I told you about the situation, so get to it!}
{115}{}{好吧。我告诉过你当时的情况了，快去做吧！}
### {116}{}{Anything useful about what happened to those missing citizens?}
{116}{}{关于那些失踪公民的遭遇，有什么有用的吗？}
### {117}{}{I'm afraid still nothing useful.}
{117}{}{恐怕还是没什么用。}
### {118}{}{Those bullies from the old mine are practically a harmless bunch. I doubt they could be involved in kidnapping or even killing anyone. Their so called leader Keel thinks Mr. Basil is responsible for these crimes. Furthermore he claims Mr. Basil is keeping his victims locked up somewhere.}
{118}{}{那些来自旧矿井的恶霸实际上是一群无害的人。我怀疑他们可能参与绑架甚至杀害任何人。他们所谓的领导人基尔认为巴西尔应对这些罪行负责。此外，他声称巴兹尔把受害者关在某处。}
### {119}{}{I found out those smugglers in the old mine are responsible for the kidnappings. They probably killed all of the hostages since they had no use for them. I'm sure accusing Mr. Basil was just a cover up story for the whole mess.}
{119}{}{我发现那些老矿井里的走私犯应对绑架事件负责。他们可能杀死了所有的人质，因为他们对他们没有任何用处。我确信指责巴兹尔只是掩盖了整个混乱局面。}
### {120}{}{I find this very hard to believe. This leader must have some serious grudge against this man. You just don't go around accusing a well known and respected member of the community. Can you say you're absolutely sure Mr. Basil is somehow involved, and believe it? Better question, yet, did this Keel provide any evidence to support his claims?}
{120}{}{我觉得这很难相信。这位领导人一定对这个人怀恨在心。你只是不能到处指责社区中一位知名和受人尊敬的成员。你能说你绝对确定巴兹尔先生在某种程度上参与其中吗？相信吗？然而，更好的问题是，基尔是否提供了任何证据来支持他的说法？}
### {121}{}{Not that I know of...}
{121}{}{据我所知。。。}
### {122}{}{Those are serious accusations... but it caught my attention as he mentioned Mr. Basil. I'll have to look into it. [Starts walking up and down.] There's only one thing we can do right now, to keep an eye on Mr. Basil, see if anything sticks out of the ordinary. Are you up to some detective work, we don't actually get paid for this but law enforcement has its benefits...}
{122}{}{这些都是严重的指控。。。但当他提到巴兹尔先生时，我注意到了这一点。我得调查一下。[开始上下走动。]我们现在只能做一件事，就是监视巴兹尔先生，看看是否有什么异常。你在做侦探工作吗？我们实际上没有得到报酬，但执法有好处。。。}
### {123}{}{Sure, I don't mind. I just want to help.}
{123}{}{当然，我不介意。我只是想帮忙。}
{124}{}{}
### {125}{}{So those smugglers are responsible? I thought so. They always looked suspicious to me. We should hurry if we want to catch them off guard. I'm not gonna let them hurt another person, not on my watch!}
{125}{}{那么这些走私者应该对此负责？我想是的。他们在我看来总是很可疑。如果我们想猝不及防地抓住他们，我们应该抓紧时间。我不会让他们伤害另一个人，在我的眼皮底下！}
### {126}{}{Let's go!}
{126}{}{我们走吧！}
### {127}{}{This town got its name mainly because of this valley. The golden part stayed since this place was once famous for its natural resources, which was gold. But since we ran out of it, can't say tourism is flourishing. Town was founded about two hundred years ago by our first mayor whose statue can be seen on the main square, west of here. We don't have any public happenings or fairs, people simply lost their interest since we're all trying to survive. Couple of years ago some caravans used to stop by but I haven't seen any for a long time. You might want to go visit the fun house, 20th century games are still very popular here. Just watch yourself, you can occasionally run into a wild animal at night. Lots of outsiders but less friendly faces. I'm doing my best but... there's just too much to do.}
{127}{}{这个小镇之所以得名，主要是因为这个山谷。黄金部分留下来，因为这个地方曾经以其自然资源而闻名，那就是黄金。但既然我们已经用完了，就不能说旅游业正在蓬勃发展。大约两百年前，我们的第一任市长创建了这个小镇，他的雕像可以在这里以西的主广场上看到。我们没有任何公共活动或博览会，人们只是失去了兴趣，因为我们都在努力生存。几年前，一些大篷车经常来这里，但我已经很久没见过了。你可能想去参观娱乐屋，20世纪的游戏在这里仍然很受欢迎。只要注意自己，你偶尔会在晚上碰到野生动物。很多局外人，但面孔不那么友好。我已经尽力了，但是。。。有太多事情要做。}
### {128}{}{Thanks. That's more than I needed to know.}
{128}{}{谢谢这超出了我需要知道的范围。}
### {129}{}{Welcome back stranger. What can I do for you?}
{129}{}{欢迎陌生人回来。我能为你做什么？}
### {130}{}{Got anything to report?}
{130}{}{有什么要报告的吗？}
### {131}{}{Nothing.}
{131}{}{没有什么}
### {132}{}{Why don't you allow Mary to sell drinks in her casino?}
{132}{}{你为什么不允许玛丽在她的赌场里卖饮料？}
### {133}{}{Because I've had problems with her customers in the past. She doesn't care what kind of people her business attracts, all she gives a damn about is money. And because of that, anybody can enter her casino, no matter their gear, mind-set or condition. And when it's filled with all kind of scum from the wasteland, there's always a fight or two breaking out. I could not tolerate that, so I did what had to be done. It helped more than I had anticipated.}
{133}{}{因为我过去和她的客户有过问题。她不在乎她的生意吸引了什么样的人，她在乎的只是钱。正因为如此，任何人都可以进入她的赌场，无论他们的装备、心态或条件如何。当它充满了来自荒原的各种渣滓时，总会爆发一两场战斗。我不能容忍这种情况，所以我做了该做的事。它的帮助比我预想的要大。}
### {134}{}{If she introduces a stricter policy towards her customers, is there a chance you could grant her permission to sell drinks again? She has to cover her losses after all.}
{134}{}{如果她对顾客实行更严格的政策，你有机会再次允许她销售饮料吗？她终究要弥补损失。}
### {135}{}{I understand, but trust me sheriff, her intentions are honest.}
{135}{}{我理解，但相信我，警长，她的意图是诚实的。}
### {136}{}{You've got to be kidding me. I could trust almost anyone - but her? All I know is Mary will never agree to lower her income for the sake of public safety. I know her too well... If you are really concerned about this, make sure she doesn't do something she may later regret.}
{136}{}{你一定是在开玩笑。我几乎可以信任任何人――但她除外？我只知道玛丽永远不会同意为了公共安全而降低收入。我太了解她了。。。如果你真的很担心这件事，一定要确保她没有做一些她以后可能会后悔的事情。}
### {137}{}{Understood, sheriff.}
{137}{}{明白了，警长。}
### {138}{}{To hell with you! New laws are being made around here, right now!}
{138}{}{见鬼去吧！现在，这里正在制定新的法律！}
### {139}{}{If she decides to make such a move, I will help her with a permit - and her customers. That's my job after all.}
{139}{}{如果她决定采取这样的行动，我会帮她拿到许可证――还有她的客户。这毕竟是我的工作。}
### {140}{}{Thanks, sheriff.}
{140}{}{谢谢，警长。}
### {141}{}{I'm good with my fists. I can take out almost anything with these two. They never let me down.}
{141}{}{我的拳头很好。有了这两个，我几乎什么都能吃。他们从不让我失望。}
### {142}{}{Alright, you'll do just fine. Here's the situation... I've got a problem with one of the locals. His name is Bob but people call him Crazy Booze. He is constantly getting drunk so badly he stumbles on the street, walks disoriented and yells a lot. Once he broke into someone's house, fortunately nobody was home at the time. He could've got himself killed... I want him behind bars immediately. Find that drunkass and bring him here!}
{142}{}{好吧，你会做得很好的。情况如下。。。我和一个当地人有意见。他的名字叫鲍勃，但人们都叫他疯子。他经常喝得烂醉如泥，在街上跌跌撞撞，走得晕头转向，大喊大叫。有一次他闯进别人家，幸运的是当时没人在家。他可能会自杀。。。我要他立即入狱。找到那个醉汉，把他带到这儿来！}
### {143}{}{Yes, sir.}
{143}{}{是的，先生。}
### {144}{}{I don't see Bob behind those bars. Did you find him?}
{144}{}{我没看见鲍勃在监狱里。你找到他了吗？}
### {145}{}{Not yet.}
{145}{}{还没有。}
### {146}{}{Excellent work stranger! I plan to keep him here for a while, until he sobers up... well, probably longer. I don't want to see him reaching out for booze minutes after leaving his cell. When he gets out, he'll be as good as new. Thanks again.}
{146}{}{出色的工作陌生人！我打算让他在这里呆一段时间，直到他清醒过来。。。嗯，可能更长。我不想看到他在离开牢房几分钟后伸手去喝酒。当他离开时，他会像新来的一样。再次感谢。}
### {147}{}{No problem, sheriff.}
{147}{}{没问题，警长。}
### {148}{}{I still can't believe Mr. Basil did this. We were so naive to let his generous gestures and donations leave us completely blind. I had my doubts but others made me let my guard down and believe what I saw. What I did not see, was far worse than I could ever imagine. [Sighs.] But slavery, in this town...}
{148}{}{我仍然不敢相信巴西尔先生会这么做。我们太天真了，任由他的慷慨姿态和捐款让我们完全失明。我有疑虑，但其他人让我放松警惕，相信我所看到的。我所没有看到的，比我所能想象的要糟糕得多。但是奴隶制，在这个城市。。。}
### {149}{}{Unfortunately it's true. I managed to rescue most of the captives but I'm afraid for some it was too late. Can't say for sure what happened to the others, whether they were moved to another location or else.}
{149}{}{不幸的是，这是真的。我设法救出了大部分俘虏，但对一些人来说恐怕为时已晚。不能确定其他人发生了什么，他们是被转移到另一个地方还是其他地方。}
### {150}{}{Don't worry about that, I'll send my men to search for each and every one of them... I just can't let go of the thought it all happened in front of our noses, all the things they had to endure. It's just overwhelming. [Kicks his desk.] Damn it! }
{150}{}{别担心，我会派我的人去寻找他们中的每一个人。。。我无法释怀这一切都发生在我们眼前，他们不得不忍受的一切。简直让人无法承受。[踢他的桌子。]该死！}
### {151}{}{Don't be hard on yourself. We won a battle today. If we keep it that way, one step forward at a time, there is hope.}
{151}{}{不要对自己太苛刻。我们今天赢了一场战斗。如果我们保持这种状态，一步一个脚印，就有希望。}
### {152}{}{You're right. Only decisive actions can guarantee success. It's a long road ahead but better start walking while we have the strength. I'd like you to stay for a while, good men are hard to find... [he sighs]... and the help is much needed, especially these days. I've got a feeling the worst is yet to come.}
{152}{}{你说得对。只有果断的行动才能保证成功。前面的路很长，但最好趁我们有力气的时候开始走。我想让你住一段时间，好人难找。。。[他叹了口气]。。。这种帮助是非常需要的，尤其是现在。我有一种感觉，最糟糕的情况还没有到来。}
### {153}{}{Will do. Take care sheriff.}
{153}{}{会的，小心警长。}
### {154}{}{Nice to see you again. What can I do for you?}
{154}{}{很高兴再次见到你。我能为你做什么？}
### {155}{}{Can I ask you something?}
{155}{}{我能问你点什么吗？}
### {156}{}{Sure thing, partner.}
{156}{}{当然，伙计。}
### {157}{}{Actually, there's nothing I need right now.}
{157}{}{事实上，我现在什么都不需要。}
### {158}{}{I've managed to rescue some captives who were locked up under Basil's place...}
{158}{}{我设法救出了一些被关在巴兹尔家里的俘虏。。。}
### {159}{}{One of the books from the library is missing. Jasmine asked me to find it.}
{159}{}{图书馆的一本书不见了。Jasmine让我去找它。}
### {160}{}{Hm, I might be able to help you with that. [Searches through his locker]...}
{160}{}{嗯，我也许能帮你。[搜查他的储物柜]。。。}
### {161}{}{[Wait.]}
{161}{}{[等待]}
### {162}{}{[Few seconds later, he takes out a book from a pile.] Is this what you're looking for? My man found it lying on the floor in Bob's house.}
{162}{}{[几秒钟后，他从一堆书中拿出一本书。]这就是你要找的吗？我的人发现它躺在鲍勃家的地板上。}
### {163}{}{Looks like it, thanks sheriff.}
{163}{}{看起来不错，谢谢警长。}
### {164}{}{[You look at the book.] I'm not sure... but I'll take it.}
{164}{}{[你看那本书。]我不确定。。。但我会接受的。}
### {165}{}{Talk to you later, I have to check something first.}
{165}{}{稍后再和你谈谈，我得先检查一下。}
### {166}{}{[Pulls the book out of your hand.] ...then it stays here. Everything we find is going to be returned to it's rightful owner, otherwise it's called stealing.}
{166}{}{[把书从你手里拿出来。]……然后它就留在这里。我们发现的所有东西都会被归还给它的合法所有者，否则就被称为偷窃。}
### {167}{}{I don't care, just give me the damn book.}
{167}{}{我不在乎，只要把那本该死的书给我就行了。}
### {168}{}{Since when... ah, forget it.}
{168}{}{从什么时候开始。。。啊，算了。}
### {169}{}{[Takes out the same book from his locker.] Are you sure this time?}
{169}{}{[从储物柜里拿出同一本书。]这次你确定吗？}
### {170}{}{Yes, definitely. Thanks.}
{170}{}{是的，当然。谢谢}
### {171}{}{Well, still can't tell for sure.}
{171}{}{嗯，还是不能确定。}
### {172}{}{I found Bob's dead body in his bed. This time he drank himself to death. Apparently, he choked on his own vomit while sleeping.}
{172}{}{我在鲍勃的床上发现了他的尸体。这一次他喝得烂醉如泥。显然，他在睡觉时被自己的呕吐物呛到了。}
### {173}{}{[Sighs.] His days of self abuse finally caught up with him. I don't believe he had any relatives that I know of but he made sure nobody will miss him. What a pitiful way to go, poor bastard.}
{173}{}{他自虐的日子终于赶上了。据我所知，我不相信他有任何亲戚，但他确保没有人会想念他。多么可怜的路啊，可怜的混蛋。}
### {174}{}{You know... [sighs] his house is just across the street!? And [glowers]... some people saw you arguing with Bob. Tell me, was that about the time you found his body?}
{174}{}{你知道。。。他的房子就在街对面！？还有[怒目而视]。。。有些人看到你和鲍勃吵架。告诉我，那是你发现他的尸体的时候吗？}
### {175}{}{You can't know, you weren't there!}
{175}{}{你不可能知道，你不在那里！}
### {176}{}{You think you know everything!? Why don't you tell me!}
{176}{}{你以为你什么都知道！？你为什么不告诉我！}
### {177}{}{I see where this is going... [Run for it.]} #hostility#after 173{178}{}{You know what they say, what goes around comes around. See you later.}
{177}{}{I see where this is going... [Run for it.]} #hostility#after 173{178}{}{你知道他们说什么，什么来了什么来了。回头见。}
### {179}{}{Oh, I'm sure somebody, somewhere will miss him. But life goes on and so must we.}
{179}{}{哦，我相信有人会想念他的。但生活还在继续，我们也必须如此。}
### {180}{}{I'll tell you what I know! You are in some serious deep shit, punk! Hand over your weapons, you're about to have some quality time in the slammer.}
{180}{}{我会告诉你我所知道的！你陷入了严重的困境，朋克！交出你的武器，你将在监狱里度过一段美好的时光。}

We'll see each other again, you hear me!} #dude goes to jail{182}{}{Screw you, I'm not finished yet!} #hostility#float line, dude from jail{183}{}{?As you know, madness is like gravity... all it takes is a little push.?} #mandatory#{184}{}{Hold it right there you son of a bitch!
