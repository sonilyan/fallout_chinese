#{950}{}{Really? Did you see any children there? What were they like?}
{950}{}{真的吗？你在那里看到孩子了吗？他们是什么样子的？}
#{951}{}{I did see children. They were playing in the street, happy and cheerful.}
{951}{}{我确实看到孩子们，他们兴高采烈地在街上玩耍。}
#{1000}{}{Really? Did you see any children there? What were they like?}
{1000}{}{真的吗？你在那里看到孩子了吗？他们是什么样子的？}
#{1001}{}{I did see children. They were playing in the street, happy and cheerful.}
{1001}{}{我确实看到孩子们，他们兴高采烈地在街上玩耍。}
#{1050}{}{Children safely playing in the street. Such a thing is possible only in the Imperial City. [You see a glimmer of hope in her crestfallen eyes.] Do you really want to help? I have nothing to give you...}
{1050}{}{孩子们安全地在街上玩耍。这种事只有在帝国之城。[你从她沮丧的眼神中看到一丝希望。]你真的想帮忙吗？我没有什么可以给你...}
#{1051}{}{Sure, what do you need?}
{1051}{}{当然，你需要什么？}
#{1052}{}{I'm not doing anything for free. Goodbye.}
{1052}{}{我不会免费做任何事。再见。}
#{1100}{}{It's my daughter. Sophie is safe here, but I fear they'll find out one day and take her away. She must get into the Imperial City. I know it'd be impossible for both of us to get in, but if one of the dwellers takes her in Sophie might have a chance. I don't want to lose her... but anything is better then being at the mercy of the Mutant Hunters.}
{1100}{}{是我的女儿。索菲在这里很安全，但我担心有一天他们会发现并带走她。她必须进入帝国之城。我知道我们两个不可能都进去，但如果其中一个居民带她进去，索菲可能会有机会。我不想失去她…但任何事情都比受变种猎人的摆布要好。}
#{1101}{}{What's wrong with your daughter?}
{1101}{}{你女儿怎么了？}
#{1150}{}{[She sighs.] Sophie has six toes on her feet. There's nothing wrong with her otherwise, but even something like that is enough for the Mutant Hunters to kill her. As if my little girl could hurt anyone. But I've heard that they aren't that strict in the empire and, most importantly, the Hunters couldn't touch her there. Please, try to find someone who'd look after my Sophie.}
{1150}{}{[她叹了口气。] 索菲的脚上有六个脚趾。除此之外她没什么问题，但即使是这样的事也足以让变种猎人杀了她。好像我的小女儿能伤害任何人似的。但我听说帝国没有那么严格，最重要的是，猎人们不能碰她。拜托，找个人来照顾我的苏索。}
#{1151}{}{I'll see what I can do...}
{1151}{}{我看看我能做什么...}
#{1152}{}{You're protecting a mutant?! You deserve to die, just like they do!}
{1152}{}{你在保护一个变种人？！你应该去死，就像他们一样！}
#{1200}{}{I've already told you to leave. And please, don't come back this time.}

#{1202}{}{I have some questions.}
{1202}{}{我有一些问题。}
#{1203}{}{I've changed my mind. Whatever it is you need, I'll help you for free.}
{1203}{}{我改主意了。不管你需要什么，我都免费帮你。}
#{1204}{}{Goodbye then.}

#{1300}{}{Any news? Is there hope for my daughter?}
{1300}{}{有消息吗？我女儿还有希望吗？}
#{1301}{}{A woman in the Imperial City called Lorain has lost her son recently and would be willing to take your daughter in. She knows about the toes and doesn't mind.}
{1301}{}{帝国之城有个叫洛雷恩的女人最近失去了她的儿子，她愿意收留你的女儿。她知道脚趾的事，也不介意。}
#{1302}{}{Not yet.}
{1302}{}{还没有。}
#{1303}{}{Uf.}
{1303}{}{呃。}
#{1350}{}{And is she a kind woman? Do you believe she'll take good care of Sophie?}
{1350}{}{她是个善良的女人吗？你相信她会好好照顾索菲吗？}
#{1351}{}{I do.}
{1351}{}{我愿意。}
#{1400}{}{Then this is good news. At least, I think so. I never really thought Sophie could get in. I don't want to lose her, but I know this is the only way. What do I need to do?}
{1400}{}{那么这是个好消息。至少，我是这么认为的。我从没想过索菲能进去。我不想失去她，但我知道这是唯一的办法。我需要做什么？}
#{1401}{}{Let's take Sophie to the gates of the Imperial City.}
{1401}{}{我们带索菲去城门口吧。}
#{1450}{}{[Tears well up in her eyes.] Saying goodbye to my own daughter is just unbearable. I'll never see her again. I hope she'll have a good life there. Thank you for your help, I doubt I'll ever be able to repay you. But please, take these 100 caps at least. It's all I have.}
{1450}{}{[她泪流满面 。]和自己的女儿说再见让我难以忍受。我再也见不到她了。我希望她在那里能过得好。谢谢你的帮助，我恐怕永远也报答不了。但请你至少带上这100瓶盖。我只有这些了。}

{1451}{}{[拿上瓶盖。]再见。}
#{1452}{}{Keep the caps, you need them more than I do. Farewell.}
{1452}{}{把瓶盖留着吧，你比我更需要。再见。}
#{1500}{}{What do you want, Hunter?}
{1500}{}{你想要什么，猎人？}
#{1501}{}{You look nervous, do you have any reason to be?}
{1501}{}{你看起来很紧张，是什么原因？}
#{1502}{}{You're Catherine, yes? They say you're hiding your little daughter. Who are you protecting her from?}
{1502}{}{你是凯瑟琳吗？他们说你把小女儿藏起来了。你在保护她不受谁的伤害？}
#{1503}{}{Just taking a look around.}

#{1504}{}{Ech.}
{1504}{}{呃。}
#{1550}{}{You are mistaken.}
{1550}{}{你错了。}
#{1551}{}{I don't think so. Now spit out what's going on before I beat it out of you.}
{1551}{}{我不这么认为。最好在我揍你之前把发生的事都说出来。}
#{1552}{}{Very well.}
{1552}{}{非常好。}
#{1600}{}{I have nothing to say to you.}

#{1602}{}{I warned you.}
{1602}{}{我警告过你。}
#{1603}{}{Very well. You're lucky I'm in a good mood.}
{1603}{}{很好。你该庆幸我心情不错。}
#{1650}{}{[You try to talk to the girl, but she silently hides behind her mother.] You must excuse her, she's afraid of strangers.}
{1650}{}{[你试着和那个女孩说话，但她默默地躲在她妈妈的后面。]请你原谅，她害怕陌生人。}
#{1651}{}{You look nervous, do you have any reason to be?}
{1651}{}{你看起来很紧张，是什么原因？}
#{1652}{}{You must be Catherine, and the girl your daughter Sophie. They say you're hiding her, and she's obviously afraid of Hunters. Tell me what's wrong with her or I'll take her straight to base!}
{1652}{}{你一定是凯瑟琳，那个女孩就是你的女儿索菲。他们说你把她藏起来了，她显然很害怕猎人。告诉我她怎么了，否则我直接把她带回基地！}

{1703}{}{我懂了。}
#{1704}{}{Ech.}
{1704}{}{呃。}
#{1750}{}{I just don't want anything to happen to her. It doesn't seem safe outside. Albuquerque is constantly under siege by ghouls and many dangerous mutants get into the Suburbs.}
{1750}{}{我只是不想她出什么事。外面看起来不安全。阿尔伯克基经常被僵尸围攻，还有许多危险的变种人进入郊区。}
#{1751}{}{And you wouldn't happen to know anything concrete about a mutant in the Suburbs, would you?}
{1751}{}{你不会碰巧对郊区的变种人有什么具体的了解吧？}
#{1752}{}{Tell your stories to someone who might believe them. I want the truth!}
{1752}{}{把你的故事讲给可能相信你的人听。我要知道真实情况！}

#{1851}{}{I'll beat it out of you yet.}
{1851}{}{我会“打”出真相的。}
#{1852}{}{Very well. You're lucky I'm in a good mood.}
{1852}{}{很好。你该庆幸我心情不错。}
#{1900}{}{[Tears well up in her eyes.] No, please, don't take her away! She just has one extra toe on her feet, that's all. My little girl wouldn't ever hurt anyone, she's innocent. Why should she suffer? Please, don't tell anyone about her.}
{1900}{}{[她泪流满面 。]不，求你了，别把她带走！她只是脚上多了一个脚趾，仅此而已。我的小女儿不会伤害任何人，她是无辜的。她为什么要受苦呢？求你了，别把她的事告诉任何人。}

#{2002}{}{Save your pittance, I'd rather just kill both you and the mutant.}
{2002}{}{省省你的钱吧，我宁愿把你和变种人都杀了。}
#{2003}{}{Better than nothing. Bye.}
{2003}{}{总比没有好。再见。}
#{2050}{}{I understand. If it saves my daughters' life, I'll do it. [She turns to her daughter.] Sophie, go to bed. Close your eyes and cover your ears, OK? Do it. [Sophie reluctantly obeys.]}
{2050}{}{我明白了，如果能救我女儿的命，我会做的。[她转向女儿。]索菲，去睡觉，闭上眼睛，捂住耳朵，好吗？去做吧。[索菲勉强服从。]}
#{2051}{}{[Rape her.]}
