{220}{}{你为什么停止与车库城的交易？}

{284}{}{是的，有一个案例。我们以为这是一个狂野的婆罗门。}

{285}{}{我本应该想得更好。你很幸运，牧羊人没有受伤。否则，整个普韦布洛人都会生你的气。但你承认错误是件好事。至少我知道我应该对你更加小心。}

### {290}{}{You know, Mangas asked me to destroy the moonshine factory in Phoenix.}
{290}{}{曼加斯让我摧毁凤凰城的私酒工厂。}
### {291}{}{Who does he think he is? A shaman cannot deprive us all of pleasure so easily. No one will like it. At least Mangas can't decide for all the clans at once, he's not the supreme leader.}
{291}{}{他以为自己是谁？萨满不能轻易剥夺我们所有人的快乐。没有人会喜欢的。至少曼加斯不能同时决定所有的部族，他不是最高领袖。}
### {292}{}{So you're against Mangas' proposal?}
{292}{}{所以你反对曼加斯的提议？}
### {293}{}{This is everyone's business, not just the leader's. Instead of following the whims of this grumpy old man, it's better to get me a box of Phoenix swill. I will find a use for it during the celebration of the Day of the Sun.}
{293}{}{这是每个人的事，而不仅仅是领导的事。与其听从这个脾气暴躁的老人的奇思妙想，不如给我买一盒菲尼克斯雨燕。我会在庆祝太阳日的时候找到它的用处。}
### {294}{}{But what's the problem with getting alcohol?}
{294}{}{但是喝酒有什么问题？}
### {295}{}{Don't you know? We cut off all deals with Phoenix because of the war. Of course, we also know how to make moonshine from cacti, but real tequila from the city does not go to any comparison.}
{295}{}{你不知道吗？因为战争，我们切断了与菲尼克斯的所有交易。当然，我们也知道如何用仙人掌制作月光酒，但来自城市的真正龙舌兰酒无法与之相比。}
### {296}{}{How many bottles do you need?}
{296}{}{你需要多少瓶？}
### {297}{}{Ten bottles of tequila and the same number of bottles of beer.}
{297}{}{十瓶龙舌兰酒和同样数量的啤酒。}
### {298}{}{Okay, I'll think about which one of you to support in this dispute.}
{298}{}{好吧，我会考虑在这场争论中支持你们中的哪一个。}
### {299}{}{Remind me how many bottles of alcohol do you need?}
{299}{}{提醒我你需要多少瓶酒？}
### {300}{}{I have just as much alcohol as you need.}
{300}{}{我的酒和你需要的一样多。}
### {301}{}{May your name be glorified by the Sun-loving Brahmin himself! With such reserves, our holiday will not be overshadowed even by the war going on around. Thank you. If you need the services of a tanner, then remember me. I'll do anything for you for a reduced fee.}
{301}{}{愿你的名字得到爱太阳的婆罗门本人的荣耀！有了这样的储备，我们的假期不会被周围正在进行的战争所掩盖。非常感谢。如果你需要制革工的服务，请记住我。我会为你做任何事情，但费用会降低。}

### {310}{}{What do you sell? }
{310}{}{你们卖什么？}
### {311}{}{I make various items out of Brahmin leather. But mostly they are used by members of the tribe. I no longer do business with Phoenix and its colonies. Only rangers can make their orders.}
{311}{}{我用婆罗门皮革做各种各样的东西。但大部分是部落成员使用的。我不再与凤凰城及其殖民地做生意。只有护林员才能下达命令。}
### {312}{}{I see.}
{312}{}{我明白了。}
### {313}{}{What items do you make?}
{313}{}{你做什么产品？}
### {314}{}{Clothes, belts, bags and much more. I make armor for the Rangers.}
{314}{}{衣服、皮带、包包等等。我为游骑兵制造盔甲。}
### {315}{}{What's the problem with the Phoenix?}
{315}{}{凤凰号出了什么问题？}
### {316}{}{We co-existed peacefully for a while. But for the last few years, white people have been coming from the big city with guns to subdue us or take away from us what belongs to us. The tribe can't stand it.}
{316}{}{我们和平共处了一段时间。但在过去的几年里，白人一直从大城市带着枪来制服我们，或者夺走属于我们的东西。部落无法忍受。}
### {317}{}{You say you have a good relationship with the Rangers?}
{317}{}{你说你和流浪者队关系很好？}
### {318}{}{They help us resist the invaders from Phoenix. And they have always been good customers in my tannery.}
{318}{}{他们帮助我们抵抗来自凤凰城的入侵者。他们一直是我制革厂的好顾客。}
### {319}{}{And who do you support in this dispute?}
{319}{}{在这场争论中，你支持谁？}
### {320}{}{It's hard to say. The Rangers have treated us well so far, but I suspect they are not pure in mind. After all, they have their own interests in this conflict.}
{320}{}{这很难说。到目前为止，流浪者队对我们很好，但我怀疑他们的心态并不纯洁。毕竟，他们在这场冲突中有自己的利益。}
### {321}{}{[Next]}
{321}{}{[下一个]}
### {322}{}{At the same time, we have been peacefully existing with Phoenix for a long time and actively traded with it until the relationship deteriorated. Phoenix would have given us more opportunities if it weren't for the greedy tyrant at the head there.}
{322}{}{同时，我们与凤凰和平相处了很长一段时间，并积极与之进行交易，直到关系恶化。如果不是那个贪婪的暴君，凤凰城会给我们更多的机会。}
### {323}{}{I see.}
{323}{}{我明白了。}
