#{102}{}{Oww, my head.}
{102}{}{噢，我的头。 -- Oww, my head.}
#{103}{}{You have accessed the door, which leads to the second elevator.}

#{113}{}{Ughh... Thank you, citizen. You17re just in time. These outsiders have taken over the vault. How did you manage to get in here?}
{113}{}{呃。。。谢谢你，市民。你来得正是时候。这些外人接管了金库。你怎么进来的？ -- Ughh... Thank you, citizen. You17re just in time. These outsiders have taken over the vault. How did you manage to get in here?}
#{114}{}{It wasn17t that hard. More importantly, what do we do next?}
{114}{}{没那么难。更重要的是，我们下一步该怎么办？ -- It wasn17t that hard. More importantly, what do we do next?}
#{115}{}{Right. Fighting the outsiders is pointless. It17s too many of them and they are well armed. The only option left for us is to comply with their demands, or find some other, more clever way to neutralize them.}
{115}{}{正确的。与外人作战毫无意义。他们太多了，而且装备精良。留给我们的唯一选择就是遵从他们的要求，或者找到其他更聪明的方法来压制他们。 -- Right. Fighting the outsiders is pointless. It17s too many of them and they are well armed. The only option left for us is to comply with their demands, or find some other, more clever way to neutralize them.}
#{116}{}{Any ideas?}
{116}{}{有什么想法吗？ -- Any ideas?}
#{117}{}{We could try to activate the defense systems. I have access to the Automated Vault Control Systems, if we can get there and turn on the defenses. But it is probably jammed.}
{117}{}{我们可以试着启动防御系统。如果我们能到达那里并打开防御系统，我可以进入自动保险库控制系统。但它可能卡住了。 -- We could try to activate the defense systems. I have access to the Automated Vault Control Systems, if we can get there and turn on the defenses. But it is probably jammed.}
#{118}{}{Any other ways to deal with them?}
{118}{}{还有别的办法对付他们吗？ -- Any other ways to deal with them?}
#{119}{}{Yes, but it's lethal. According to the procedure, in the case of a hostile invasion we must destroy the entire secret floor downstairs. The explosion will completely destroy the entire Vault, we won17t be able to escape.}
{119}{}{是的，但它是致命的。按照程序，如果有敌人入侵，我们必须摧毁楼下的整个秘密楼层。爆炸将彻底摧毁整个保险库，我们将无法逃生。 -- Yes, but it's lethal. According to the procedure, in the case of a hostile invasion we must destroy the entire secret floor downstairs. The explosion will completely destroy the entire Vault, we won17t be able to escape.}
#{120}{}{That17s not fair...}
{120}{}{这不公平。。。 -- That17s not fair...}
#{121}{}{Then we either fight them all by ourselves or comply with their demands. There17s a guard robot in the next room, if we could repair it, it should give us a little edge. In any case, I can17t just sit here doing nothing, after all of this. The council lied to us, and these guys aren17t exactly handing out cake and balloons. [he rubs his bruises]}
{121}{}{然后我们要么自己和他们战斗要么服从他们的要求。隔壁房间有个警卫机器人，如果我们能修好它，它会给我们一点优势。无论如何，我不能坐在这里无所事事，毕竟这一切。委员会对我们撒了谎，而这些人并没有分发蛋糕和气球。[他擦伤] -- Then we either fight them all by ourselves or comply with their demands.

#{122}{}{Excellent, in that case, follow me Sergeant. I need someone covering my back.}
{122}{}{太好了，那样的话，跟我来，中士。我需要有人掩护我。 -- Excellent, in that case, follow me Sergeant. I need someone covering my back.}
#{123}{}{Sit tight for a while, I need to scout around. We have to think about this first.}
{123}{}{坐一会儿，我要四处侦察。我们得先考虑一下。 -- Sit tight for a while, I need to scout around. We have to think about this first.}

{124}{}{情况如何？ -- What17s the situation?}
#{125}{}{Wait up, I need to look around.}
