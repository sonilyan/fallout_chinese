{1151}{}{别担心，我会想办法的。这是你的奖赏。[给她50个瓶盖]}
#{1200}{}{[While she counts the caps, you take advantage of her distraction and throw a couple of pots and some plates down from the table. The impact creates enough noise to be heard through the whole house.]}
{1200}{}{[当她数瓶盖的时候，你利用她的注意力，从桌上扔下几个罐子和一些盘子。撞击产生的噪音足以穿透整个房子。]}
#{1201}{}{[While she counts the caps, you take advantage of her distraction and throw a couple of pots and some plates down from the table. The impact creates enough noise to be heard through the whole house.]}
{1201}{}{[当她数瓶盖的时候，你利用她的注意力，从桌上扔下几个罐子和一些盘子。撞击产生的噪音足以穿透整个房子。]}

#{1251}{}{I was thinking the sheriff's cook might be able to help me with something. I've bought this flask of the finest whiskey. [Show her the flask with poison.] I'd like to give it to the sheriff, you know, as a gift. Do you think he'd appreciate it?}
{1251}{}{我在想警长的厨师也许能帮我做点什么。我买了这瓶最好的威士忌。[给她看装有毒药的瓶子]我想把它送给警长，你知道，作为礼物。你觉得他会感激吗？}
#{1252}{}{I was thinking the sheriff's cook might be able to help me with something. I've bought this flask of the finest whiskey. [Show her the flask with poison.] I'd like to give it to the sheriff, you know, as a gift. Do you think he'd appreciate it?}
{1252}{}{我在想警长的厨师也许能帮我做点什么。我买了这瓶最好的威士忌。[给她看装有毒药的瓶子]我想把它送给警长，你知道，作为礼物。你觉得他会感激吗？}
#{1253}{}{Oh, I won't stand in your way.}
{1253}{}{哦，我不会妨碍你的。}
#{1300}{}{You're trying to suck up to the boss, eh? Well, too bad for you, he already got a flask like that already. In fact, exactly like this one. I know that 'cause he lets me fill it for him.}
{1300}{}{你想讨好老板，是吗？好吧，对你来说太糟糕了，他已经有一个这样的瓶子了。事实上，和这个一模一样。我知道是因为他让我替他填的。}
#{1301}{}{[Sigh.] You got no idea how many caps I paid for it. But I'll bet he doesn't have whiskey this fine. What if you swapped the flasks next time you'll be filling it? If they are exactly the same, he won't notice, but when he takes a sip, I bet he'll be really pleased. And when he asks, you could tell him everything, we both get an extra point in the boss' book. What do you say?}
{1301}{}{你不知道我花了多少钱买的。但我敢打赌他没有这么好的威士忌。如果下次你要装的时候把瓶子换了怎么办？如果他们完全一样，他不会注意到，但当他喝了一口，我打赌他会非常高兴。当他问的时候，你可以告诉他一切，我们都会在老板的书上多记一分。你怎么说？}
#{1350}{}{I don't know. The sheriff's an old mule, he's real careful when it comes to new stuff. On the other hand, if that works out, I might get some kind of recognition. I'd like a couple of extra caps added to my pay. [She hesitates, you can see she's considering your proposal until she finally decides.] OK, give it here. If he doesn't like it, I'll think of something to say.}
{1350}{}{我不知道。警长是个老顽固，他对新事物非常小心。另一方面，如果成功的话，我可能会得到某种认可。我想在工资里再加上几顶瓶盖。[她犹豫了一下，你可以看到她在考虑你的提议，直到她最终做出决定。]好的，给我。如果他不喜欢，我会想办法说的。}
#{1351}{}{Great. [Give her the flask.] I'll be back later to find out if it worked.}
{1351}{}{伟大的。[把烧瓶给她]我一会儿回来看看是否管用。}
