### {171}{}{The most direct. I'm part of this church.}
{171}{}{最直接的。我是这个教堂的一部分。}
### {172}{}{Hmm... What a curious coincidence. I usually try to bypass any religion. But Followers contribute to progress in Arizona and, as a result, the development of my cartel. You can feel protected here.}
{172}{}{嗯…真是个奇怪的巧合。我通常试图绕过任何宗教。但追随者们为亚利桑那州的进步做出了贡献，因此也为我的卡特尔的发展做出了贡献。在这里你会感到受到保护。}

{195}{}{我非常怀疑。护林员有很多敌人，他们的数量太少，无法独立管理人口。在我活着的时候，他们肯定永远无法控制这座城市。}
### {196}{}{What's your problem with the Rangers?}
{196}{}{你对流浪者队有什么问题？}
### {197}{}{I have *no* problems with them. But I'm not going to share power with anyone. I put too much work into this mine and created this whole city practically from scratch.}
{197}{}{我对他们没有意见。但我不会和任何人分享权力。我在这个矿上投入了太多的工作，几乎从零开始创建了整个城市。}
### {198}{}{Yes, you can think about it.}
{198}{}{是的，你可以考虑一下。}
### {199}{}{Rangers are busy with narrow interests. They are not able to create a new production. And this is exactly what people need right now.}
{199}{}{游骑兵忙于狭隘的利益。他们无法创造新的产品。这正是人们现在所需要的。}

### {202}{}{(puts down the headphones and presses some buttons on the device, then points to the device) It's an old record player.

{1210}{}{你不是那种爱说话的人，是吗？女士，你在想什么？}

### {211}{}{I am here because someone enslaved the peasants of the Villa and took them in this direction.}
{211}{}{我来这里是因为有人奴役了别墅的农民，把他们带向这个方向。}
### {212}{}{No one likes it when their usual way of life is violated. I don't like it when the ruins run out of minerals, as a result of which you need to look for new places to mine. But I have dozens of scavengers and several contracts under my command.}
{212}{}{没有人喜欢他们通常的生活方式受到侵犯。我不喜欢废墟中的矿物耗尽，因此你需要寻找新的开采地点。但我手下有几十个拾荒者和几份合同。}
### {213}{}{[Next]}
{213}{}{[下一个]}
### {214}{}{Villa was lucky. But it's hard for people of your type to understand. While you are busy with your internal worries, we, the scavengers, provide equipment for the whole of Southern Arizona. I don't think anyone else cares about the fate of the Villa, except the local peasants.}
{214}{}{维拉很幸运。但你这种类型的人很难理解。当你忙于内心的担忧时，我们拾荒者为整个亚利桑那州南部提供设备。我想除了当地的农民，其他人都不关心别墅的命运。}
### {215}{}{Bastard, so it was you who ordered the peasants to be captured?}
{215}{}{混蛋，是你下令抓农民的？}
### {216}{}{So you don't deny your involvement?}
{216}{}{所以你不否认你的参与？}
### {217}{}{Me? Of course not. It was a project of another, more influential organization. We just happened to be on the way. And if I were you, I would forget this story and go back to my empty house to start all over again.}
{217}{}{我当然不是。这是另一个更有影响力的组织的项目。我们刚好在路上。如果我是你，我会忘记这个故事，回到我空荡荡的房子里重新开始。}
### {218}{}{Do you think it's that simple?}
{218}{}{你觉得就这么简单吗？}
### {219}{}{There are no other ways for you. However, you can stay here and work as a garbage collector if you like it. What do you say?}
{219}{}{你别无选择。但是，如果你喜欢的话，你可以留在这里做垃圾收集工。你觉得怎么样？}
### {220}{}{I...}
{220}{}{我}
### {221}{}{It's like you're rejoicing at our tragedy.}
{221}{}{你好像在为我们的悲剧而高兴。}
### {222}{}{Am I happy? No. But when WE needed help in times of famine, YOU meanwhile profited from it and demanded double rates from us. Well, is it nice to feel like a litter this time?}
{222}{}{我快乐吗？没有。但当我们在饥荒时期需要帮助时，你却从中获利，并要求我们加倍收费。好吧，这次感觉像垃圾一样好吗？}
### {223}{}{That's not what I'm asking.}
{223}{}{这不是我要问的。}

### {230}{}{These scavengers can be unbearable when they get drunk... Listen, if you're going to stay in town, you're going to need my protection. And now a great opportunity has turned up to show itself.}
{230}{}{这些拾荒者喝醉了会让人难以忍受...听着，如果你要留在城里，你需要我的保护。现在出现了一个展示自己的大好机会。}
### {231}{}{Are you suggesting I calm down the workers?}
{231}{}{你是在建议我让工人们冷静下来吗？}
### {232}{}{Go to the dorm and find out what happened there. I don't need any extra problems in the city.}
{232}{}{去宿舍看看那里发生了什么。我在城里不需要任何额外的麻烦。}
### {233}{}{I'll see what I can do.}
{233}{}{我看看我能做些什么。}
### {234}{}{I don't think I want to work for you.}
{234}{}{我想我不想为你工作。}
### {235}{}{Great. Oh, yes, I didn't introduce myself. Karl Kogan. Now get busy.}
{235}{}{太棒了哦，是的，我没有自我介绍。卡尔・科根。现在开始忙碌吧。}
### {236}{}{. . .}

### {237}{}{Then you don't belong in Garage City. Get out of my garage.}
{237}{}{那你就不属于车库城了。滚出我的车库。}

{241}{}{你发现宿舍打架的事了吗？}
### {1241}{}{What did you find out about the fight in the dorm?}
{1241}{}{你发现宿舍打架的事了吗？}
### {242}{}{Nothing. I'll do it right now.}
{242}{}{没有什么我现在就做。}
### {243}{}{Can I ask a couple of questions?}
{243}{}{我能问几个问题吗？}
### {244}{}{First prove that you are worthy of my attention. Or do you already want to get out of town?}
{244}{}{首先证明你值得我关注。还是你已经想出城了？}
### {1244}{}{First prove that you are worthy of my attention. Or do you already want to get out of town?}
{1244}{}{首先证明你值得我关注。还是你已经想出城了？}
### {245}{}{Okay, I'll do your errand.}
{245}{}{好的，我来帮你跑腿。}
### {246}{}{That's exactly what I'm going to do.}
{246}{}{这正是我要做的。}
### {247}{}{Lucas's men robbed Trayvon's men and left town. They were talking about some kind of decoder.}
{247}{}{卢卡斯的人抢劫了特雷文的人并离开了小镇。他们在谈论某种解码器。}
### {248}{}{I know, you idiot! How long has it been since I gave you this assignment? Your chances of proving your usefulness are rapidly disappearing.}
{248}{}{我知道，你这个白痴！我给你这个任务已经有多久了？你证明自己有用的机会正在迅速消失。}
### {1248}{}{I know, damn it! How long has it been since I gave you the assignment? Your chances of proving your usefulness are rapidly disappearing.}
{1248}{}{我知道，该死！我给你分配任务有多久了？你证明自己有用的机会正在迅速消失。}
### {249}{}{What's going on anyway?}
{249}{}{怎么回事？}
### {250}{}{I didn't expect this from Lucas. His clan had a reputation for being a small but punchy team. If he decides to go against me, he will have to pay dearly for it.}
{250}{}{我没想到卢卡斯会这么说。他的家族以小而有力著称。如果他决定与我作对，他将为此付出高昂的代价。}
### {251}{}{I have questions about this story with Lucas.}
{251}{}{我对卢卡斯的故事有疑问。}
### {252}{}{Is there anything else I can do for you, Mr. Kogan?}

### {1252}{}{Is there anything else I can do for you, Mr. Kogan?}
{1252}{}{Kogan先生，我还能为你做什么吗？}

### {253}{}{I have the answers.}
{253}{}{我有答案。}
### {254}{}{Why are the clans so bitter against each other?}
{254}{}{为什么部族之间如此仇恨？}
### {255}{}{Recently, mine revenues have been falling, so it has become difficult for scavengers to survive. Previously, the clans got along well - there was enough work for everyone. Now they have become fierce competitors.}
{255}{}{最近，矿山收入一直在下降，因此拾荒者很难生存。以前，部落相处得很好――每个人都有足够的工作。现在他们已经成为了激烈的竞争对手。}
### {256}{}{What's the story with the decoder?}
{256}{}{解码器是怎么回事？}
### {257}{}{A rare device for hacking electronic systems. I ordered a decoder for a large amount of caps through the southern caravans and gave it to the Trayvon clan to open the old factory. It's the only place we couldn't get to because of the damn security system. It looks like Lucas decided to bypass all of us in this operation.}
{257}{}{一种罕见的用于入侵电子系统的设备。我通过南部大篷车订购了大量瓶盖的解码器，并将其交给特雷冯家族，让他们打开旧工厂。这是我们唯一不能去的地方，因为该死的安全系统。看起来卢卡斯决定在这次行动中绕过我们所有人。}
### {258}{}{Why was it necessary to divide the scavengers into clans?}
{258}{}{为什么有必要把拾荒者分成部落？}
### {259}{}{They wanted it themselves. People need authorities, that's how their thinking works. I don't care who I give instructions to. The main thing is that they obey and do not create problems.}
{259}{}{他们自己想要。人们需要权威，这就是他们的思维方式。我不在乎我给谁下达指令。最重要的是他们服从，不会制造问题。}
### {260}{}{Enough about the scavengers.}
{260}{}{关于拾荒者已经够多了。}

### {262}{}{I've had enough of these muddy stories. Goodbye.}
{262}{}{我受够了这些乱七八糟的故事。再见}

### {270}{}{Are you the local headman?}
{270}{}{你是当地的校长吗？}
### {271}{}{Elder... Is that what the peasants call the mayor? No, the city doesn't need a mayor. At least for now. I'm the head of a cartel of scavengers. But since the whole city is tied up in this business, no important decision can do without me. In this sense, you can consider me a "prefect".}
{271}{}{长者这就是农民们对市长的称呼吗？不，这个城市不需要市长。至少目前是这样。我是一个拾荒者卡特尔的头目。但既然整个城市都在做这件事，任何重要的决定都离不开我。从这个意义上说，你可以把我视为“州长”。}
### {272}{}{So you're the mayor of this town?}
{272}{}{你是这个镇的镇长吗？}
### {273}{}{I'm telling you, the city doesn't need a mayor. At least for now. I'm the head of a cartel of scavengers. But since the whole city is tied up in this business, no important decision can do without me. In this sense, you can consider me the mayor.}
{273}{}{我告诉你，这个城市不需要市长。至少目前是这样。我是一个拾荒者卡特尔的头目。但由于整个城市都在做这件事，任何重要的决定都离不开我。从这个意义上说，你可以把我视为市长。}
### {274}{}{How did you become the head of the company? Surely went over the heads of competitors?}
{274}{}{你是如何成为公司负责人的？肯定超过了竞争对手的头？}
### {275}{}{Stupid stereotypes. I started out as an ordinary garbage man in a Big City. The cartel already existed, I just took a vacant place in the administration. And then we opened a branch on these ruins, and I decided to move here to control the work.}
{275}{}{愚蠢的刻板印象。我一开始是一个大城市里的普通垃圾工。卡特尔已经存在了，我只是在政府中占据了一个空缺。然后我们在这些废墟上开了一家分店，我决定搬到这里来控制工作。}
### {276}{}{It's not like you want to come back.}
{276}{}{你好像不想回来。}
### {277}{}{I'm afraid we have some with the main office... disagreements.}
{277}{}{恐怕我们总公司有一些...分歧。}
### {278}{}{What is your cartel doing?}
{278}{}{你们的卡特尔在干什么？}
### {279}{}{Mainly extracts minerals from old ruins. For a hundred years after the Great War, many things have deteriorated, but some have survived and can be useful to society. We also try to fix some things, but things are much more complicated with this.}
{279}{}{主要从古老的废墟中提取矿物。在大战后的一百年里，许多事情都恶化了，但有些事情幸存下来，对社会有用。我们也试图解决一些问题，但事情要复杂得多。}

### {280}{}{My village does not like that you are restoring an old factory.}
{280}{}{我的村子不喜欢你在修复一个旧工厂。}
### {281}{}{Why is that? Oh, yes, I've heard a lot about your superstitions and fear of old technology. Well, you have no choice. Accept it.}
{281}{}{为什么？哦，是的，我听过很多关于你的迷信和对旧技术的恐惧。你别无选择。接受它。}
### {282}{}{Really?}
{282}{}{真正地}
### {283}{}{From now on, no one will let your peaceful village prosper by manual labor alone and live according to the laws of conscience. Cities are being reborn. If not now, then later someone will come here to restore production. It's inevitable.}
{283}{}{从现在起，没有人会让你平静的村庄仅靠体力劳动繁荣起来，并按照良心法则生活。城市正在重生。如果不是现在，那么以后会有人来这里恢复生产。这是不可避免的。}
### {284}{}{It seems impossible to fight this. Goodbye.}
{284}{}{这似乎是不可能对抗的。再见}
### {285}{}{The elders want isolation. They don't like that strangers will come to the valley again.}
{285}{}{长辈们希望与世隔绝。他们不喜欢陌生人再次来到山谷。}
### {286}{}{As I said, it's inevitable. All you can do is prepare. You could buy weapons, build fences, restore lost property, and even create a more efficient irrigation system. And for this, oddly enough, you just need the services of my company.}
{286}{}{正如我所说，这是不可避免的。你所能做的就是做好准备。你可以购买武器，建造围栏，恢复损失的财产，甚至创建一个更高效的灌溉系统。奇怪的是，你只需要我公司的服务。}
### {287}{}{Are you offering a deal?}
{287}{}{你提供交易吗？}
### {288}{}{Considering that the whole city is to blame for your troubles and that the factory was opened by your own hands, I propose to provide services to your Villa at a very low price. This will give jobs to the city and allow your people to prepare for the inevitable. Everyone will benefit.}
{288}{}{考虑到整个城市都应该为你的麻烦负责，而且工厂是你自己开的，我建议以很低的价格为你的别墅提供服务。这将为城市提供就业机会，让你的人民为不可避免的事情做好准备。每个人都会受益。}
### {289}{}{Sounds interesting. But there is a problem in convincing the elders. I'll think about it.}
{289}{}{听起来很有趣。但是，说服长辈是有问题的。我会考虑的。}

### {300}{}{What's on your mind?}
{300}{}{你在想什么？}
### {301}{}{Nothing special. I'm going to do something.}
{301}{}{没什么特别的。我要做点什么。}

#Quest 2
### {310}{}{Old Lucas made an unforgivable mistake. He hit my reputation. And more importantly, he ruined my plans.}

### {311}{}{[Listen]}
{311}{}{[听]}
### {312}{}{But that's not the main thing right now, I'll deal with it later. It is much more important to get radio components out of the factory. I need them as soon as possible. Can you do it?}
{312}{}{但这不是目前的主要问题，我稍后再处理。更重要的是把收音机部件从工厂里拿出来。我需要他们尽快。你能做到吗？}
### {313}{}{What if I kill Lucas?}
{313}{}{如果我杀了Lucas怎么办？}
### {314}{}{I doubt you have the guts and the skills. And if they kill you, then our whole conversation will be meaningless. Just get me what I'm asking for.}
{314}{}{我怀疑你是否有勇气和技巧。如果他们杀了你，那么我们的整个谈话将毫无意义。把我要的东西给我。}
### {315}{}{I see. I'll do it.}
{315}{}{我明白了。我会做的。}

{397}{}{真正地}
