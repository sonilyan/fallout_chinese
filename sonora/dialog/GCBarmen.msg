### {429}{}{Is it that bad?}
{429}{}{有那么糟糕吗？}

{430}{}{确切地我们过去常与南方城市进行贸易，用零件换取产品。但我们现在不仅几乎没有什么可交易的，他们还宣布在圣婆罗门抵制。他们不再把肉卖给任何人。}

### {447}{}{So now buy meat from the rangers.}
{447}{}{所以现在从护林员那里买肉。}
### {448}{}{I can buy meat from the rangers. But it will be much more expensive. And I'm not at all happy about the prospect of walking under the heel of these guys. We have a pretty strained relationship with them in the Garage, you know. But it seems that there is no choice anymore.}
{448}{}{我可以从护林员那里买肉。但它会贵得多。我对被这些家伙踩在脚下的前景一点也不高兴。你知道，我们在车库里和他们的关系很紧张。但似乎已经别无选择了。}

{455}{}{游骑兵领地的某个人同意和你交换食物。}
### {456}{}{Business is coming to life. Thanks to you, we are getting food again. So hunger does not threaten the city. But the boots of the rangers have already trampled the entrance to my establishment. Or maybe it's for the best? I don't know. In any case, thank you. Take a hundred as a share of the deal.}
{456}{}{商业正在复苏。多亏了你，我们又有饭吃了。因此，饥饿不会威胁到这座城市。但是护林员的靴子已经践踏了我的住所的入口。或者也许这是最好的？我不知道。不管怎样，谢谢你。拿一百作为交易的一部分。}
### {457}{}{You're welcome.}
{457}{}{不客气。}
### {458}{}{There will be no caravans. The tribe became angry at the outsiders after a series of murders.}
