I can provide you with a job which would kick some experience into you. Still, there's a chance that you'll kick be bucket instead. When you'll drop your cockfighting attitude and get a little smarter, we can talk details. [he goes back to sharpening the knife]}
{50}{}{如果这里有其他的豺狼而不是我，你会对一只钉好的蝙蝠或其他什么东西感到满意。[他停止了说话，研究了你一会儿]我是乌苏。我可以为你提供一份能给你带来一些经验的工作。尽管如此，你还是有可能会被吊脚踢。当你放弃斗鸡的态度，变得更聪明时，我们可以讨论细节。[他又开始磨刀]}

{121}{013}{告诉我更多关于狩猎的信息。}


### {130}{}{I found a place not far away from here, which has been chosen as a lair by the huge pack of Ursa. The goal is simple - travel there and kill them all. After that, we'll carry their corpses to the camp. The rest is not our business. If you're in, I'd recommend stocking some meds, ammo and get the biggest gun you can. If you are ready, we can leave right away. If the hunt is good, you'll get some batteries as a reward. }
{130}{}{我在离这里不远的地方找到了一个地方，它被巨大的熊群选为巢穴。目标很简单――去那里旅行并杀死他们。之后，我们将把他们的尸体运到营地。剩下的不关我们的事。如果你在，我建议你储备一些药物和弹药，并尽可能多地拿一把最大的枪。如果你准备好了，我们可以马上离开。如果狩猎很好，你会得到一些电池作为奖励。}

### {164}{018}{Maybe.}
{164}{018}{大概}


### {170}{}{I'm not blind. You are fighting not like the people who lived all their lives in Radius. It looks as you first laid hands on a weapon around a month ago.

[he looks at you, waiting for an answer]}
{170}{}{我不是瞎子。你不像在Radius生活了一辈子的人那样在战斗。看起来就像你一个月前第一次拿到武器一样。你杀了，但缺乏技巧，你的动作不够流畅。在Radius中，每个孩子都知道如何拆卸和组装步枪，以及如何以给目标带来最大痛苦的方式射击。[他看着你，等待回答]}

{183}{023}{你怎么知道的？}


### {190}{}{From what I know, fighters from the Olympus can give hell to anyone in Radius. You are definitely not one of them.}
{190}{}{据我所知，来自奥林巴斯的战士可以给Radius的任何人下地狱。你绝对不是他们中的一员。}
### {191}{020}{Because I'm no soldier. I'm a Servant.}
{191}{020}{因为我不是军人。我是一个仆人。}

{200}{}{[他点点头]有一次，我和我的搭档偶然发现了一个来自奥林匹斯山的人。已经死了，穿着一件奇怪的制服――有NCASTR标志的东西。我的人弗雷德拿走了它。这就是我遇到奥林匹斯人的全部经验。}

### {282}{999}{No, thanks again for the directions.}
{282}{999}{不，再次感谢你的指示。}


### {290}{}{On one of our hunts we wandered off - had some troubles catching up to the prey. Came across a mansion. An empty one. There was a skeleton inside, maybe from before the war, but the house itself was untouched. Looks like we were the first ones to find this place in years. We never told about it to anyone. And then Fred laid his eyes on one of our trophy girls. Snuck her out. I advised him to take shelter in that house. As paranoid as he is, he should still be there. Not sure for how long though. }
{290}{}{在一次狩猎中，我们迷路了――在追赶猎物时遇到了一些困难。偶然发现了一座豪宅。一个空的。里面有一具骨架，可能是战前的，但房子本身没有动过。看起来我们是多年来第一个发现这个地方的人。我们从来没有告诉任何人这件事。然后弗雷德把目光投向了我们的一个奖杯女孩。把她抱出去。我劝他躲在那所房子里。尽管他很偏执，但他应该还在那里。但不确定要持续多久。}
### {291}{010}{Great, thanks. I have some questions.}
{291}{010}{太好了，谢谢。我有一些问题。}
### {292}{999}{Great, thanks. I've got to go.}
{292}{999}{太好了，谢谢。我得走了。}


### {300}{}{I better know the surrounding wastelands than Radius. I'm a hunter, I hunt on my territory. Was never very amused by human settlements. Although, there is one place that every Jackal knows about: Rainbow. Know where it is?}
{300}{}{我比Radius更了解周围的荒地。我是一个猎人，我在我的领地上狩猎。从来没有被人类住区逗乐过。尽管如此，每个豺狼都知道一个地方：彩虹。知道它在哪里吗？}
