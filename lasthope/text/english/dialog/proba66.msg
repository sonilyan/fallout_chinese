{100}{}{You see: someone in robes.}
{101}{}{You can't see much of his face, it's all dark.}
#
{102}{}{I do not know you.}
{103}{}{You can't be in here.}
{104}{}{This is my home, you're not welcome here.}
{105}{}{This is my place, not yours.}
{106}{}{Go away and leave me be.}
#
{107}{}{Why do you wish to speak with me?}
#
{108}{}{Who are you?}
{110}{}{Actually, I don't want to talk to you right now.}
#1
{111}{}{I'm Gordon and this is my home. Tell me, why are you disturbing me?}
#
{112}{}{My mistake, sorry.}
#
{113}{}{You again, what do you want?}
#
{114}{}{Nothing sorry.}
{115}{}{Hey. Could you tell me what d'you need those robes for?}
#
{116}{}{How do you know about 'em? Those were in my locker, you broke it! Thief!}
{117}{}{OK, tell me, did you rob Jack?}
{118}{}{Dead men don't talk!}
#
{124}{}{What are you talking about! I didn't rob Jack, it was those Falcon Brothers.}
{125}{}{Falcon Brothers?}
#
{127}{}{Yes! Let me tell you what happened. I usually go out at night looking for junk, food... Anything I can find.
 About a couple of days ago, I went out just as I usually do, and saw some men running from Jack's store. I couldn't do
 anything, so I just returned home.}
{128}{}{Could you tell me more about them?}
{129}{}{Hah! Biggest lie I've ever heard!}
#
{130}{}{I told you everything I know.}
{131}{}{Go now.}
{132}{}{I have nothing more to say.}
# more about them
{133}{}{They have a caravan camp near this village, let me show you on the map. [Shows you the location of some
 small desert village.] I also found those purple robes not far from Jack's. They must have dropped them after the
 robbery... Go now, I have nothing more to say.}
{134}{}{Thanks, Gordon.}
#  biggest lies
{135}{}{You are really dumb. Breaking into my home... calling me a liar... You shall learn some respect!}
{136}{}{Show me what you got, grandpa!}
#
{137}{}{You should not have come back!}
