{100}{}{Hello there, what can Dr. Davin do for you?}
{101}{}{What can you tell me about this place?}
{102}{}{Got any medicine I could trade for?}
{103}{}{I'm hurt.}
{104}{}{Nothing.}
#about this place
{105}{}{Not much, since I moved here recently. My skills were requested because the local doctor, Jay, left town
 some time ago, only to turn out missing. From chatting with the locals, I figured this town has become a very
 dangerous place. I receive new patients almost too often, mostly victims of robbers or bandits. The good part is I have
 plenty of medical supplies so I can cure people in a rather short time but there are still too many of those who require
 medical attention. Of course, the most I can do here is treating light wounds, cuts, burns... But bone fractures for
 example, I have no other option but to send them to a hospital in Forth City. There they got all kinds of medical
 equipment.}
{106}{}{Forth City?}
{107}{}{Got any medicine I could buy?}
#Forth city
{108}{}{It's a small military place. Can't tell you exactly where it is, for my own safety reasons. Anyway, important
 thing is they want to help people, which is good, but it's not for free. Every month I have to pay them $6000. I'm
 not supposed to tell you this, but I'm in debt big time. People help me as much as they can, but when it all sums up,
 still not enough to pay those bills.}
{109}{}{I'm sorry to hear that. Let me ask you something else.}
#got any medicals...
{110}{}{Medicine, of course. Here's what I have.}
{111}{}{Alright.}
#i'm hurt
{112}{}{OK, let me see. That'll cost you $100.}
{113}{}{OK, let me see. That'll cost you $200.}
{114}{}{OK, let me see. That'll cost you $300.}
{115}{}{You're pretty messed up, it'll cost you $600.}
{116}{}{Hmm, this is a serious wound. That'll cost you $500}
{117}{}{Here's your payment.}
{118}{}{No way doc, that's too much for me.}
{119}{}{Sorry, I don't have that much right now.}
#too much...
{120}{}{How do you think I pay these bills? Medical supplies cost and I have to earn some money. Life is expensive
 these days, don't you know that.}
#
{121}{}{Feeling better?}
{122}{}{Much better, thanks doc.}
#
{123}{}{I' don't talk with criminals.}
{124}{}{Go away, I don't want to have any business with you.}
#
{125}{}{Thank you. Come back if you need any of my services.}
{126}{}{Thanks doc.}
#
{127}{}{Don't do that!}
{128}{}{I'm warning you!}
#again...
{129}{}{Something I can help you with?}
#forth city...
{130}{}{That's odd... all that secrecy and all that money. Seriously, where do you send these people?}
{131}{}{Can you at least tell me what other towns are nearby? I believe one of my "best friends" is there. I want to
 give her a warm welcome when she gets out, if you know what I mean?}
{132}{}{It's good you mention this because I need help. You see, I have got a piece of shrapnel in my head that
 needs to be taken out... and I don't have much time.}
{133}{}{You know "doc", I don't like no for an answer. Start talking right now!}
#130
{134}{}{I already told you. This is as far as I can go. If you don't have any more questions, I should get back to my
 work.}
{135}{}{Uh... okay.}
#131
{136}{}{What are you talking about, you should have your head thoroughly examined. But before that, please leave.}
#132
{137}{}{And I have even less time to listen to this nonsense. Please leave.}
