#{504}{}{Just passing through.}
{504}{}{只是路过。}
#{505}{}{Ghe.}

{554}{}{只是路过。}
#{600}{}{[He raises his voice so his men would hear him.] We've got a mutant here!}
{600}{}{[他提高了声音，好让他的人听到。]这里有个变种人！}
#{601}{}{What?}
{601}{}{什么？}
#{650}{}{Riiight, just passing through. I doubt that, idiot. I'm giving you one more chance before I gladly take you out.}
{650}{}{好吧，只是路过。我很怀疑，白痴。我再给你一次机会，否则我很乐意带你出去。}
#{651}{}{I want to find out what this sign is. [Show him the talisman.]}

#{750}{}{Great. You can't be all that bad if you killed one those damned ghouls. We Mutant Hunters can appreciate that. You could get a nice reward for that talisman.}
{750}{}{很好。如果你杀了一个该死的僵尸你就不会那么坏了。我们变种猎人能理解这一点。你的护身符会给你带来不错的回报。}
#{751}{}{But what meaning does the talisman have?}

{802}{}{我们说的是什么奖励？}
#{803}{}{Can I pass then?}
{803}{}{我可以过去吗？}
#{850}{}{Why the fuck should I care?! All I need to know is that every ghoul belonging to a certain group of troublemakers wears one. If that's not exhaustive enough for you, you'll learn more in our base. I only care about the fucking ghouls when they're within the range of my gun.}
{850}{}{我他妈为什么要关心？！ 我需要知道的是，属于某个麻烦制造者的每个僵尸都戴着一个。 如果这对您来说还不够详尽，您会在我们的基地了解更多。我只关心那些他妈的在我的射程之内的僵尸。}
#{851}{}{What reward can I get for the talisman?}
{851}{}{我的护身符能得到什么回报呢？}
#{852}{}{Where can I find your base?}

#{1051}{}{Can I ask you a few things about the city?}
{1051}{}{我能问你一些关于这个城市的事情吗？}
#{1052}{}{I'll keep that in mind.}
{1052}{}{我会记住这一点。}
#{1100}{}{OK, but keep it short, I'm not a freaking guide. I'm in charge of defending this place.}

#{1101}{}{What is this place, anyway?}
{1101}{}{这到底是什么地方？}
#{1102}{}{Who's in charge here?}

#{1107}{}{What kinds of people live here?}
{1107}{}{什么样的人住在这里？}
#{1108}{}{I'll be going now, farewell.}
{1108}{}{我要走了，再见。}
#{1150}{}{This is Albuquerque, the biggest city far and wide, maybe even the only one.}
{1150}{}{这就是阿尔伯克基，世界上最大的城市，甚至可能是唯一的城市。}
#{1151}{}{How did it originate?}
{1151}{}{它是怎么产生的？}
#{1152}{}{I want to ask something else.}
{1152}{}{我想问点别的。}
#{1200}{}{Not much. The best thing to do here is take a decent gun and start shooting the ghouls lurking around the city.}
{1200}{}{并不多。现在最好的办法就是拿把像样的枪开始射杀潜伏在城市周围的鬼僵尸。}
#{1201}{}{Why would I want to do that?}
{1201}{}{我为什么要那么做？}
#{1202}{}{I want to ask something else.}
{1202}{}{我想问点别的。}
#{1250}{}{You mean besides fun? You'll free the lives of pure humans from some filthy mutants.}
{1250}{}{你是说除了好玩？你会把纯人类从肮脏的变种人手中解放出来。}
#{1251}{}{And do you know about any work?}
{1251}{}{你知道有什么工作吗？}
#{1252}{}{I want to ask something else.}
{1252}{}{我想问点别的。}
#{1300}{}{The city is big enough to have a whole lot of people that want help with their stupid problems. But if you're really worth something, you'll join us. We're always looking for pure humans willing to fight.}
{1300}{}{这座城市足够大，有很多人需要帮助解决他们愚蠢的问题。但如果你真的有价值，就加入我们吧。我们一直在寻找愿意战斗的纯人类。}
#{1301}{}{What kinds of people live here, anyway?}
{1301}{}{到底是什么样的人住在这里？}
#{1302}{}{You're taking on people, fine. But who are you?}
{1302}{}{你在找人，好吧。但你是谁？}
#{1303}{}{I want to ask something else.}
{1303}{}{我还想问点别的。}
#{1350}{}{We're Mutant Hunters, we're ridding the world of mutated scumbags.}
{1350}{}{我们是变种猎人，我们正在消灭世界上的变种人渣。}
#{1351}{}{Care to elaborate?}
{1351}{}{能详细说明一下吗？}
#{1352}{}{I want to ask something else.}
{1352}{}{我还想问点别的。}
#{1400}{}{Look, I'm not big on talking. When I see a mutant, I give it a quick death. If you want to know more, ask in our base.}
{1400}{}{听着，我不喜欢说话。我一看到变种人，就会让他死得痛快。如果你想了解更多，请到我们的基地询问。}
#{1401}{}{Where did you say the base was?}
{1401}{}{你说的基地在哪里？}
#{1402}{}{I want to ask something else.}
{1402}{}{我还想问点别的。}
#{1450}{}{You should definitely visit the Wild Paradise inn across the street near our base. And there's a hospital in the Dead Quarter if you need healing. The doctors there are a suspicious bunch of fuckers though, so I wouldn't risk it.}
{1450}{}{你应该去狂野天堂酒店街对面附近的基地。如果你需要治疗，死区有家医院。那里的医生都是些可疑的混蛋，所以我不会冒这个险。}
#{1451}{}{I want to ask something else.}
{1451}{}{我还想问点别的。}
#{1500}{}{The Vault dwellers just crawled out of their hole and started living on the surface. And we're here since they couldn't protect their lazy asses by themselves. They let us build a base here, and in return we get to entertain ourselves by defending the city and such.}
{1500}{}{避难所的居住者爬出洞穴，开始在地表生活。我们来这是因为他们连自己的懒虫都保护不了。他们让我们在这里建立基地，作为回报，我们可以通过保卫城市来自娱自乐。}
#{1501}{}{And who are you?}
{1501}{}{你是谁？}
#{1502}{}{I want to ask something else.}
{1502}{}{我还想问点别的。}
#{1550}{}{Most of the refugees that gather here in the Suburbs came from cities and villages destroyed by ghouls. We got all sorts of fuckers here, from dumbass tribals to people from pretty big cities. No mutants though, don't worry.}
{1550}{}{聚集在郊区的大多数难民来自被僵尸摧毁的城市和村庄。我们这里有各种各样的混蛋，从愚蠢的部落到来自大城市的人。不过没有变种人，别担心。}
#{1551}{}{I want to ask something else.}
{1551}{}{我还想问点别的。}
#{1600}{}{We, the Mutant Hunters, are in charge. If we weren't, this whole city would've gone to hell just like the rest. Well, the inhabitants of the Vault have their emperor, but since you're never getting into their part of town anyway, there's not reason to give a fuck.}
{1600}{}{我们，变种猎人，掌管一切。如果我们不这么做，整座城市都会像其他地方一样完蛋。避难所居民有他们的皇帝，但既然你永远也进不了他们的地盘，那就没理由去管他们了。}
#{1601}{}{And what people live here?}
{1601}{}{什么人住在这里？}
#{1602}{}{I want to ask something else.}
{1602}{}{我还想问点别的。}
#{1650}{}{In our quarter of the city. The locals call it Hunters' Territory.}
{1650}{}{在我们的城区。当地人称之为猎人领地。}
#{1651}{}{I want to ask something else.}
{1651}{}{我还想问点别的。}
#{1700}{}{Yeah?}
{1700}{}{是 啊？}
#{1701}{}{Can I ask you a few things about the city?}
{1701}{}{我能问你一些关于这个城市的事情吗？}
#{1702}{}{I'm a new applicant wishing to join the Hunters. I'm supposed to report to commander Dutch.}
{1702}{}{我是新来的，想加入猎人。我应该向达奇指挥官报告。}
#{1703}{}{I'm a new applicant wishing to join the Hunters. I'm supposed to report to commander Dutch.}
{1703}{}{我是新来的，想加入猎人。我应该向达奇指挥官报告。}
#{1704}{}{Just passing through.}
{1704}{}{只是路过。}
#{1705}{}{Bai.}
{1705}{}{白。}
#{1750}{}{Yeah, that's me. You'll be coming with me on a night patrol. We'll walk around the outside of the western part of the defensive wall. That's the best way to check if the whole wall is intact. And two people walking around are more likely to lure some ghoulies in range. They pull in closer at night, usually in small scouting units. They're trying to find a weak spot, or kill a few people on patrol, so don't worry about getting bored. If you do anything stupid, I'll shoot you myself. But have no fear, I'll leave you some ghouls to shoot.}
{1750}{}{是的，这就是我。你和我一起去执行夜间巡逻任务。我们将从防御墙的西边走一圈。这是检查整面墙是否完好的最好方法。两个人在附近走动更有可能引来僵尸。他们在夜间靠近，通常以小型侦察部队的形式。他们只是想找到弱点，或者杀几个巡逻的人，所以不用担心无聊。你要是做傻事，我就亲手杀了你。不过别害怕，我会给你留几个僵尸让你打。}
#{1751}{}{We'll see who gets more of them. I can go whenever you say.}
{1751}{}{看看谁能得到更多。你说什么时候走我就什么时候走。}
#{1752}{}{I need to equip myself better first, I'll be right back.}
{1752}{}{我得先把自己装备好，马上回来。}
#{1800}{}{Well? You'll miss all the fun.}
{1800}{}{好吗？你会错过所有的乐趣。}
#{1801}{}{OK, I'll go on a patrol.}
{1801}{}{好吧，我去巡逻。}
#{1802}{}{I just need a little more time.}
{1802}{}{我还需要一点时间。}
#{1803}{}{Uf.}
{1803}{}{呃。}
#{1850}{}{I see you can fight. That's enough for me. You can run along now, patrol over for you. And remember, the only good mutant is a dead mutant.}
{1850}{}{我看到你能战斗。这对我来说就足够了。你可以走了，我帮你巡逻。记住，唯一好的变种人是死了的变种人。}
#{1851}{}{Sure. Later, Dutch.}
{1851}{}{当然。稍后，达奇。}
#{1900}{}{'Ghe' fucking what? I'm asking what the hell do you want here?!}
{1900}{}{“他妈的什么？”我是问你到底想要什么？！}
#{1901}{}{He? He? [Show him the talisman.]}
{1901}{}{呵？他？[给他看护身符。]}
#{1902}{}{Buhe!}
{1902}{}{不，不！}
#{1950}{}{Fuck, you're dumber than a mutant. There's plenty of tribals among the refugees, I bet you'll fit right in with them. Now get going, you can pass. And don't make any trouble for the Hunters or we'll shoot you like a filthy mutant.}
{1950}{}{操，你比变种人还笨。难民中有很多部落，我敢说你和他们很合得来。现在走吧，你可以过去了。别给猎人找麻烦不然我们就把你当肮脏的变种人杀了。}
#{1951}{}{Baa.}
{1951}{}{嗯。}
#{2000}{}{Fuck, you're dumber than a mutant, but since you took one of them down, you can't be all that bad. You can get a few caps for that talisman, just bring it to the guy in front of our base. It's this really big building. Now get going, you can pass. And don't make any trouble for the Hunters or we'll shoot you like a filthy mutant.}
{2000}{}{操，你比变种人还蠢，但既然你干掉了其中一个，你就不可能那么坏了。你可以拿几个瓶盖做护身符，把它带给我们基地前面的人。这是一栋非常大的建筑。现在走吧，你可以过去了。别给猎人找麻烦，不然我们就把你当肮脏的变种人杀了。}
#{2001}{}{Baa.}
{2001}{}{嗯。}
#{2050}{}{Fuck, you're dumber than a mutant, but since you took one of them down, you can't be all that bad. You can get a few caps for that talisman, just bring it to the guy in front of our base.

{2100}{}{那个跟着你的怪物是什么鬼！我这辈子还没见过这么恶心的东西。}
#{2101}{}{Drools.}
{2101}{}{流口水。}
#{2150}{}{That probably isn't even worth killing! It already looks dead.}
{2150}{}{那可能根本不值得一杀！它看起来已经死了。}
#{2151}{}{Gho nice.}
{2151}{}{啊好。}
#{2200}{}{You can go in, but watch out. We Hunters are in charge here and if you do anything stupid, we'll shoot you to bits along with that nasty beast of yours. You better not leave that THING in the city unsupervised. Are we clear, moron?!}
{2200}{}{你可以进去，但要小心。我们猎人是这里的主人，如果你做了什么傻事，我们会把你和你那只可恶的野兽打成碎片。你最好别把那东西丢在城里无人看管。明白了吗，白痴？！}
