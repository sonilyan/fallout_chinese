#{101}{}{You see just a harmless drunk.}
{101}{}{你看到的只是一个无害的醉汉。}
#{102}{}{Thanks for the bottle... You know, I think, soon I won't even need it. I'm old. Bloody caravaneer's work brought me to my knees and a bottle has bent me completely... You know, you're a good person. I see it in your eyes. And I always wanted to be someone like you. But I was always missing something. Maybe I was selfish, thought only about myself... Look, let me once in my life help someone else. Here is my caravaneer's jumpsuit. Great for travel in the wastes. Take it, don't be shy. I don't need it anyway. And thank you for everything.}
{102}{}{谢谢你的瓶子。。。你知道，我想，很快我就不需要了。我老了。血淋淋的商队工作让我跪下，一个瓶子把我完全压弯了。。。你知道，你是个好人。我从你的眼睛里看到了。我一直想成为像你这样的人。但我总是错过一些东西。也许我很自私，只想着我自己。。。听着，让我一辈子帮助别人一次。这是我商队的连身衣。非常适合在荒野中旅行。拿着，别害羞。反正我也不需要。谢谢你所做的一切。}
#{103}{}{Wow, this was unexpected. And thank you, too, man.}
{103}{}{哇，真是出乎意料。也谢谢你，伙计。}

{115}{}{是的，我想从一个酒鬼那里得到什么？我得走了。}

{120}{}{哈！是啊，我知道雷诺和我的工具一样好，我已经研究过了！但是，你看，我需要弄湿我的喉咙，它非常干燥。。。}

{125}{}{那我去给你拿瓶。}

{126}{}{这是另一回事！这就是我说的！[高兴地吞下了瓶子]你能告诉你什么？问吧，别害羞。}

#{200}{}{Hmm, Reno is big... As big as the ass of a brahmin. And smells the same, but I still remember it being a true oasis in the middle of a scorched desert. There was no Great War here, the city was spared from the nuclear bombing. But to what use? Those petty people, damn them, tore it to pieces anyway. Oh, they blew the most precious thing left in the wastes.}
{200}{}{嗯，雷诺很大。。。像婆罗门的屁股一样大。闻起来也一样，但我仍然记得那是一片真正的绿洲，在焦灼的沙漠中。这里没有大战，这座城市幸免于核爆炸。但是有什么用呢？那些卑鄙的人，该死的，把它撕成碎片。哦，他们把荒地里最珍贵的东西都炸了。}
#{201}{}{Well, ya know, dat's like a hippie before the Great War. Doesn't want to listen to anyone, wants to live independently. And their boss is the kind of man that would rather have the company of good people than higher profits. That's why caravans choose to stay there, and not somewhere else. So, the place is the most cultural in the city and also the safest. That's mind boggling that they managed to achieve this. Their restaurant's great, by the way. Real expensive, though.}
{201}{}{嗯，你知道，这就像一个伟大战争前的嬉皮士。不想听任何人的，想独立生活。他们的老板是那种宁愿有好人陪伴也不愿有更高利润的人。这就是为什么商队选择留在那里，而不是其他地方。所以，这个地方是城市里最有文化的地方，也是最安全的地方。他们居然做到了这一点，真令人难以置信。顺便说一下，他们的餐厅很棒。不过，真的很贵。}
#{202}{}{[Spreads his hands out] Oh, the huge casino with card tables, roulettes, machines, humor and a sparkling sign. But the most important thing is, of course, the bar! If I were richer I would visit them more often... Though, I'm getting carried away. Not everything is good, for many the smell of easy money ruins their life. Some debtors were even sold as slaves. [he bends towards you] I'll tell you a secret, my friend, some people think that casino is not as clean as it looks. But nobody ever proved something. People are winning there, so everything must be alright.}
{202}{}{[摊开双手]哦，这个巨大的赌场有牌桌、轮盘赌、机器、幽默和闪闪发光的招牌。当然，最重要的是酒吧！如果我更富有，我会更经常地去拜访他们。。。不过，我有点忘乎所以了。并不是每件事都是好的，因为许多人的生活都被金钱的味道毁掉了。有些债务人甚至被当作奴隶出售。我告诉你一个秘密，我的朋友，有些人认为赌场不像看上去那么干净。但没人能证明什么。那里的人都赢了，所以一切都会好起来的。}
#{203}{}{Oh, miss Momsy knows a lot about girls and about people's interactions. Once I tried to hit on her, but to no avail. We, caravaneers, you know, don't mind having a good time after the hard and winding road, especially if it's the first paycheck. That's 'cause while going through the wasteland for several weeks one can only comfort himself if you know what I mean [winks]. However, the club is expensive and unsafe. There are also rumors about a maniac no one was able to catch. I hope you'll avoid meeting him.}
{203}{}{哦，妈妈小姐对女孩子和人们的交往很了解。有一次我想和她搭讪，但没用。我们，商队，你知道的，不介意在艰难和曲折的道路上度过一段美好的时光，特别是如果这是第一份薪水的话。那是因为在荒地里走了几个星期，只有你明白我的意思，才能安慰自己。然而，俱乐部是昂贵和不安全的。还有传言说一个疯子没人能抓到。我希望你不要碰到他。}
#{204}{}{Fights! [waving his fists] Blood! Wow! If I was young, I would certainly try my luck there. Now I can't even make a bet. At least the entrance is still free. [sighs] Many perished there, by the way. Some were broken in the ring, others were hung because of money. Brutal.}
{204}{}{打架！[挥舞拳头]鲜血！哇！如果我年轻，我一定会在那里碰碰运气。现在我都不敢打赌了。至少入口还是免费的。顺便说一句，很多人死在那里。有些人在拳击场上被打破了，有些人因为钱被吊死了。残酷的。}
#{205}{}{And what about suburbs? There are some ranches, some gangs settled down in the ruins, some rats and, well, and the poor, of course. Oh, in former times we were buying brahmin skins at the Mr. Luciano ranch. Those were the good times... Sincere ones.}
{205}{}{郊区呢？有一些牧场，一些帮派在废墟中定居，一些老鼠，当然还有穷人。哦，以前我们在卢西亚诺先生农场买婆罗门皮。那些是美好的时光。。。真诚的。}
#{206}{}{[Waving his hands] Building among buildings. Mr. Wright owns it, but no one wants to live 'ere, 'cause the casino is across the street. But all the local whores do their work here and pay rent to Wright. And a bunch of junkies hang around there too. Also, Patrick and I live here - seems no one else claims this floor.}
{206}{}{[挥手]建筑物之间的建筑。莱特先生拥有它，但没人想住在这里，因为赌场就在街对面。但是当地所有的妓女都在这里工作，并向赖特付房租。还有一群瘾君子也在那里闲逛。而且，帕特里克和我住在这里-似乎没有人认领这层楼。}
#{207}{}{That's right, there is one. Military boneheads, before the Big Boom, decided that such an important institution should be located in the most unexpected place. And so they placed it... Under the city park. [taps his forehead with the index finger] You don't you dare, the entrance is guarded by the Striker's guys, it's their territory. You can't go inside, he won't allow others in. You know why? There's a big smelly basement with the rats and some trash, but also there are two heavy iron doors. And what's behind them - nobody knows. They say the former government sits there, and waits.}
{207}{}{是的，有一个。军阀们，在大繁荣之前，决定把这样一个重要的机构设在最意想不到的地方。所以他们把它。。。在城市公园下面。[用食指轻拍他的额头]你不敢，入口被前锋的人把守着，这是他们的地盘。你不能进去，他不允许别人进去。你知道为什么吗？有一个臭烘烘的地下室，里面有老鼠和一些垃圾，但也有两扇沉重的铁门。他们的背后是什么-没人知道。他们说前政府坐在那里等待。}
#{210}{}{There is no local government any more. There was, however, long ago, when the mayor installed the himself as a dictatorship. Some still remember this and even now they tell horror stories to their children at nights about that time... No, Reno is different now. Now it's torn into pieces, each to his own, and they are doing it with a straight face.}
{210}{}{已经没有地方政府了。然而，很久以前，当市长把自己定位为一个独裁政权的时候。有些人仍然记得这一点，甚至现在他们告诉他们的孩子在晚上的恐怖故事大约是那个时候。。。不，雷诺现在不一样了。现在它被撕成了碎片，每一个都是他自己的，他们都是用一张脸来做的。}
#{211}{}{They are pressing Lewis little by little, but what can you do? Everyone wants to skim the cream off the area, but the man remains faithful to neutrality. It's not in his character to be someone's doormat. But, someday that will happen, it seems.}
{211}{}{他们一点一点地逼迫刘易斯，但你能做什么呢？每个人都想撇去这个地区的奶油，但这个人仍然忠于中立。他不适合当别人的门垫。但是，似乎总有一天会发生的。}
#{212}{}{Stryker and Thompson are two of a kind. Both started as raiders, now they practice "election" rhetoric. Each one pushes his own agenda, and the population, with mouths agape, eats their crap up. So they split the locals and now cannot settle them down. It is getting bad. Such things can only lead to a civil war, and it has been smoldering for several years already.}
{212}{}{史崔克和汤普森是同类中的两个。两人都是从袭击者开始的，现在他们都在练习“选举”的修辞。每个人都在推动自己的议程，民众张大嘴巴，把自己的垃圾吃掉。所以他们分裂了当地人，现在无法让他们安定下来。情况越来越糟了。这样的事情只会导致内战，而且已经持续了好几年了。}
#{213}{}{He's got the idea to make a center that would control everything. Something like a trade union, only with the president who has all the executive power. Well, of course, no one wants it, except for ordinary people. To share their hard earnings with everyone? Huh, who of the local entrepreneurs will agree to that!?}
{213}{}{他有一个想法，要建立一个控制一切的中心。有点像工会，只有拥有所有行政权力的总统。当然，除了普通人，没人想要。和所有人分享他们的辛苦收入？嗯，当地的企业家中谁会同意这一点！？}
#{214}{}{His idea is to bring back the old town hall. To make everyone ruled by it, only the mayor would be the chief and would decide everything. Undivided, with iron order, police forces, and strict reporting on everything. And you know, it would work! There are still those who remember how it was before, when after the Big Boom the mayor ruled the city. What a strict order was imposed, ooh! But is a former raider suited for this post?}
{214}{}{他的想法是把旧市政厅搬回来。为了让每个人都被它统治，只有市长才是头儿，决定一切。一心一意，有铁的秩序，有警察的力量，对一切都有严格的报告。你知道，这会有用的！还有一些人还记得大繁荣之后，市长统治这座城市之前的情形。多么严格的命令啊！但是以前的袭击者适合这个职位吗？}
#{215}{}{Each of them is busy doing his own business and isn't going to share it with anyone. In their own way they can be understood, but they can't agree among themselves. They began bickering about ten years ago. And they can't find a common language to date. Maybe they would have found one already, if not for those two - Thompson and Stryker. Who knows, who knows... }
{215}{}{他们每个人都忙着做自己的事，不打算和任何人分享。以他们自己的方式他们可以被理解，但他们之间不能达成一致。他们大约十年前开始争吵。他们至今还找不到共同语言。如果不是汤普森和史崔克这两个人，也许他们已经找到了。谁知道，谁知道。。。}
#{220}{}{Hmm, a dark matter. But if you're going to, like, set me up or wring drugs out of me, then... *hicc*!... Here what I say: Ricky the Drover has *never* dealt with drugs, and that's while the rest of the city sticks needles! But you decide for yourself, without me. It's your business.}
{220}{}{嗯，暗物质。但是如果你想陷害我或者从我身上榨出毒品，那么。。。*hicc*！。。。我要说的是：瑞奇从来没有和毒品打过交道，而这个城市的其他人都在吸毒！但你自己决定，没有我。这是你的事。}
#{221}{}{Different kinds, it seems! Everything your heart desires! There are combat drugs that came from military bases brought here by prospectors. There is some yuck from local handicraft producers. Also psychedelic drugs from Vegas that come here with caravans. And the dealers standing on all of the corners in the shade are not afraid of anything - because there are is no one to stop them.}
{221}{}{好像是不同的种类！你心中渴望的一切！有来自军事基地的战斗药物是由探矿者带到这里的。当地手工艺品生产商有些恶心。还有来自维加斯的迷幻药，和大篷车一起来到这里。站在阴凉处各角落的贩子，什么都不怕，因为没有人拦住他们。}
#{222}{}{Well, some are brought, others are produced here. Small-scale producers are numerous, notable ones are exceptional and usually no one will talk about them. All of them, like property, belong to someone. They are kept, probably in the basements, supplied with the food and components, and not even allowed to go into the city. At least that's what I reckon. And of course, it isn't possible without the involvement of the most influential people of the city.}
{222}{}{嗯，有些是带来的，有些是在这里生产的。小规模生产商众多，著名的生产商是例外，通常没有人会谈论他们。所有这些，就像财产一样，都属于某个人。他们可能被关在地下室里，提供食物和部件，甚至不准进城。至少我是这么想的。当然，没有这个城市最有影响力的人的参与是不可能的。}
#{223}{}{Here, ya see, is the deal. It happened so that in Reno all the doctors got exhausted, and their medicine ran out a long time ago, due to all the visitors the city received, over the last sixty years since the Big Boom. Also drugs work as painkillers, and components for folk medicine, and in general allow people to not to have to pay attention to the local shit. So this problem has two sides to it. And the truth is as usual somewhere in between.}
{223}{}{你看，这就是交易。事情的发生使得里诺所有的医生都精疲力尽，他们的药很早以前就用完了，因为在过去的六十年里，这个城市接待了这么多的游客。此外，药物还可以作为止痛药和民间药物的成分，一般来说，人们不必注意当地的大便。所以这个问题有两面性。事实和往常一样在两者之间。}
#{224}{}{The most innocuous sweet in Reno! It was made to help you relax after a hard day's work, there are many of those who really need it. After ten minutes of ingestion you won't care about anything. But there are also cons. It works something like pre-war Mentats. If you swallow them too often, you get migraines, it's almost guaranteed.}
{224}{}{里诺最无害的甜食！它是为了帮助你在辛苦工作一天后放松，有很多人真的需要它。吃了10分钟后你就什么都不在乎了。但也有缺点。它的工作原理有点像战前的薄荷糖。如果你吞咽太多，你会偏头痛，几乎可以保证。}
#{225}{}{Wow, it's meth from the Dirty Hurst himself! Evil genius - that's how he was called. He was a brilliant chemist, but was spending all the time on drugs, he even used slaves. Seems he crossed someone's road, big time, and was removed. Or maybe he was killed just for drugs. Because in fact, there was nothing else left in his shack. And thank God. After all, his stuff was horrible, honest!}
{225}{}{哇，是那个肮脏的赫斯特自己的冰毒！邪恶的天才-他就是这么叫的。他是一个杰出的化学家，但他把所有的时间都花在了毒品上，他甚至用奴隶。他好像过了别人的路，大功告成，被撤职了。或者他是因为吸毒被杀的。因为事实上，他的小屋里没有其他东西了。感谢上帝。毕竟，他的东西是可怕的，诚实的！}
#{230}{}{I can prattle about that for days. How many paths I came through, how many boots I have trodden, that's enough for me. Did my time. But those were the days, yeah! I even keep my old map with me, to remember... }
{230}{}{我可以唠叨几天。我走过多少条路，踩过多少只靴子，对我来说就足够了。我花了很多时间。但是那些日子，是啊！我甚至随身带着我的旧地图，为了记住。。。}
#{231}{}{It just happened so. A hotel with a good boss, a restaurant, a shop nearby. What else is needed? So it turned out to be the only one with caravan parking in the entire Reno. That's how Mr. Mordino is able to do his business: no one is fighting there, it's always crowded around there, free trade, you know. Although, come to think of it, now are hard times for Lewis. It seems he can no longer maintain his independence and that's bad.}
{231}{}{就这么发生了。有一个好老板的旅馆，一家餐馆，附近有一家商店。还需要什么？所以这是整个里诺唯一一个有大篷车停车的地方。摩迪诺先生就是这样做的：没有人在那里战斗，那里总是人山人海，自由贸易，你知道的。不过，想想看，现在是刘易斯的艰难时期。他似乎再也不能保持独立了，这很糟糕。}
#{232}{}{They are few, Vegas in the East and Salt Lake City further to the North. Let me show you on the map... But there are others, too, little places on the way. Also, old Harold became quite a rare guest from the South now. You'd better ask around about him in the store at the parking lot.}
{232}{}{他们很少，东部是维加斯，北部是盐湖城。让我在地图上给你看。。。但也有其他的，小地方在路上。而且，老哈罗德现在也成了难得的南方客人。你最好在停车场的商店里问问他。}
#{233}{}{Well, dead cities in the wastes are not that rare, and there are plenty of strange places too. What's interesting that I can recall? Well, there's a military base not far from Reno. But I don't advise you to go there: rats everywhere, and turrets piercing you through and through. Also looters are wandering around the base, they want to clean out the warehouses, but it never really works out. You want to know where? Well, if you want to die - go boldly. [he points out the location on his map]}
{233}{}{嗯，荒野中的死城并不罕见，还有很多奇怪的地方。我能回忆起什么有趣的事？离里诺不远有个军事基地。但我不建议你去那里：到处都是老鼠，炮塔不断地刺穿你。同时，劫掠者在基地四处游荡，他们想清理仓库，但从来没有真正奏效。你想知道在哪里？好吧，如果你想死-大胆地去吧。[他指出地图上的位置]}
#{234}{}{You bet, there is! [begins counting on his fingers] Well, military bases in the first place. And then toxic waste dumps. There are oodles of them here, the whole state is fucked up by those pre-war assholes! And also in the north... You know, I heard rumors that in the North, in the mountains, there is an oasis town. It's all bright with lights in every house, the streets are lit with lamps, people are walking around in blue pajamas. Some daredevils went there once to look for it, but instead of oasis there is the worst place to be found: it is called NPP Poseidon Oil. They say that the radiation there is off the charts so you will glow at night without any light. I even have this point on my map, to avoid it! Can show you if you want.}
{234}{}{当然有！首先是军事基地。然后是有毒的垃圾堆。这里有很多人，整个州都被那些战前的混蛋搞砸了！在北方。。。你知道，我听说在北方，在山区，有一个绿洲小镇。每户人家灯火辉煌，街道灯火辉煌，人们穿着蓝色睡衣四处走动。一些胆大包天的人曾经去那里寻找过它，但是没有找到绿洲，而是找到了最糟糕的地方：它被称为NPP波塞冬石油公司（NPP Poseidon Oil）。他们说那里的辐射超出了图表，所以你在晚上会发光而没有任何光线。我甚至在我的地图上有这个点，以避免它！如果你愿意，我可以给你看。}
#{240}{}{Well, in sixty years much has changed here. Usually they talk about four periods. The first is the time after the Great War when the city was ruled by the mayor. The second is after the death of the mayor the great division of the city began. The third is the "Golden age" when everything became stable, and the fourth is the current civil war that's going on on the streets for last ten years. About which one do you want me to tell you?}
{240}{}{嗯，六十年来这里发生了很大的变化。通常他们谈论四节课。第一次是二战后市长统治这座城市的时候。第二是在市长去世后，城市的大分裂开始了。第三个是“黄金时代”，那时一切都变得稳定了，第四个是最近十年在街头进行的内战。你想让我告诉你哪一个？}
#{241}{}{I didn't catch that moment, was still very tiny, understood very little. I was told that when the rest of America was burning in the nuclear flame, the riots erupted in Reno, so severe you've never imagined. There are still areas where you can see the traces of those events. After all, not a single atomic bomb had fallen near the city, and, by the way, more than half a million people lived there back then! And what they did when they learned that the world is burning in hellfire? Well, some took shelter in the emergency bunkers, while others enclosed themselves in their houses, but the majority took to the streets to do evil and anarchy. The city went empty, most of the people had died from radiation, diseases and starvation.}
{241}{}{我没有抓住那一刻，仍然很渺小，很难理解。有人告诉我，当美国其他地区在核火焰中燃烧时，里诺爆发了暴乱，其严重程度你从未想象过。你仍然可以在一些地方看到这些事件的痕迹。毕竟，没有一颗原子弹落在这座城市附近，顺便说一句，当时有50多万人住在那里！当他们得知世界在地狱之火中燃烧时，他们做了什么？嗯，有些人躲在紧急掩体里，而另一些人则把自己关在自己的房子里，但大多数人走上街头作恶和无政府状态。城市空无一人，大多数人死于辐射、疾病和饥饿。}
#{242}{}{After the Great War, the town hall tried to establish order here, but managing such a crowd was impossible. At first, they just sat and waited till everything calmed down by itself, then grasped power by the iron hand of the local mayor. He was such a tyrant! He didn't spare anyone - he shot, hanged, tortured, and dispersed dissenters by gunfire. On the other hand, this allowed the city to survive, and even gain some sense of order. So the mayor was an ambiguous character... }
{242}{}{二战后，市政厅试图在这里建立秩序，但管理这么多人是不可能的。起初，他们只是坐着等一切自行平静下来，然后用当地市长的铁腕掌握权力。他真是个暴君！他没有放过任何人――他开枪、绞死、拷打，并用枪声驱散异议者。另一方面，这让城市得以生存，甚至获得某种秩序感。所以市长是个模棱两可的人。。。}
#{243}{}{When the mayor died, the town hall couldn't do a damn thing by itself. It was no longer feared by anyone. And who even needed it? Farmers? Or owners of the restaurants? Of course they wanted a free life, but of course the markets and the power supply needed to be divided somehow among everyone by someone. And then the fun began... Some owners entered into alliances with other, then they broke up, some declared each other hostile. Of course, competition was pressured, sometimes the hard way. All kinds of things happened. However, when everything settled down and everyone had found his place - people started to get along and live normally again.}
{243}{}{市长死后，市政厅一个人什么事也做不了。再也没有人害怕了。谁还需要它？农民？还是餐馆老板？当然，他们想要自由的生活，但市场和电力供应当然需要有人在每个人之间进行分配。然后乐趣开始了。。。一些业主与其他业主结盟，然后他们分手，一些宣布彼此敌对。当然，竞争是有压力的，有时是艰难的。各种各样的事情都发生了。然而，当一切安定下来，每个人都找到了自己的位置-人们开始相处，并重新正常生活。}
#{244}{}{Oh, this is the sweetest time you can imagine. It didn't last long though, just six years! Back then everyone was content with everything [passionately waving his arms]: neon signs sparkled around, people ordered music in restaurants, jazz bands and comedians were giving performances, the trading with other settlements was at full swing! During this time so many people moved here that there was no enough place to walk! But that was exactly what would become the problem. The resources of the city quickly depleted, there were too many people. And so the problems, we are still busy disentangling, started to appear. Greed - that's the bitch who made it all happen.}
{244}{}{哦，这是你能想象的最甜蜜的时光。不过没持续多久，只有6年！当时每个人都对一切都很满意[热情地挥舞着手臂]：霓虹灯闪烁，人们在餐馆点音乐，爵士乐队和喜剧演员表演，与其他定居点的交易如火如荼！在这段时间里，这么多人搬到了这里，以至于没有足够的地方步行！但这正是问题所在。城市的资源很快就枯竭了，人太多了。于是问题，我们还在忙着解开，开始出现。贪婪-就是那个婊子让这一切发生的。}
#{245}{}{It's not to be confused with the Great War! Nothing compares to that. And the current war is the flaccid, long and boring local showdown. It was started by someone called Big Louie. He was invited by a local businessman, he hoped that Big would pave his way to omnipotence, but no way, Big fooled everyone. He removed the unnecessary people, subdued local entrepreneurs to his "Committee", divided the city into sectors and appointed his men to each sector. So he ruled here for a year, and damn well, I must say. He solved the problems with water, started distributing food, but something went wrong and he went back to where he came from - to the wasteland. Since then no one has heard from him in Reno. But his minions have had quite a ride - now one stands for the City Hall, the other for the congress. But what's the good of it, their forces won't be enough to control everything. Even more so, if they keep bickering among themselves... So it's been like that for five years in a row.}
{245}{}{不要把它和伟大的战争混为一谈！没有比这更好的了。而目前的战争是软弱的，长期和无聊的地方摊牌。它是由一个叫大路易的人发起的。他是受当地一位商人的邀请，他希望大能为自己的全能铺路，但没办法，大能愚弄了所有人。他撤走了不必要的人，把当地的企业家制服在他的“委员会”里，把城市分成几个部门，并任命他的人到每个部门。所以他在这里统治了一年，我得说他妈的好。他用水解决了问题，开始分发食物，但出了点问题，他回到了自己的家乡――荒地。从那以后，雷诺再也没有他的消息了。但他的手下却有不少麻烦――现在一个代表市政厅，另一个代表国会。但有什么好处，他们的力量不足以控制一切。更重要的是，如果他们继续争吵。。。所以连续五年都是这样。}
#{1112}{}{[Two bulging, yellowed eyes covered with a net of swollen capillaries stare up at you. You struggle to determine whether this creature is truly alive.] Hey, buddy?! What do you want from the old Ricky the Drover?}
{1112}{}{[两只鼓鼓的，泛黄的眼睛上布满了肿胀的毛细血管网，正盯着你。你很难确定这个生物是否真的活着？！你想从那个老车夫里基那里得到什么？}
#{1202}{}{[Spreads his hands out] Oh, the huge casino with card tables, roulettes, machines, humor and a sparkling sign. But the most important thing is, of course, the bar! If I were richer I would visit them more often... Though, I'm getting carried away. Not everything is good, for many the smell of easy money ruins their life. Some debtors were even sold as slaves. [he bends towards you] I'll tell you a secret, my friend, some people think that casino is not as clean as it looks. But nobody ever proved something. People are winning there, so everything must be alright.}
{1202}{}{[摊开双手]哦，这个巨大的赌场有牌桌、轮盘赌、机器、幽默和闪闪发光的招牌。当然，最重要的是酒吧！如果我更富有，我会更经常地去拜访他们。。。不过，我有点忘乎所以了。并不是每件事都是好的，因为许多人的生活都被金钱的味道毁掉了。有些债务人甚至被当作奴隶出售。我告诉你一个秘密，我的朋友，有些人认为赌场不像看上去那么干净。但没人能证明什么。那里的人都赢了，所以一切都会好起来的。}
