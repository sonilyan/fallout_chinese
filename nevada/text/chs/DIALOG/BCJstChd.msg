#{100}{}{You see Eugene.}
{100}{}{你看到尤金了。}
#{101}{}{You see a scruffy young man in a leather jacket. He looks like he hasn't washed in a long time.}
{101}{}{你看到一个穿着皮夹克的邋遢青年。他看起来好久没洗了。}
#{102}{}{We don't need all sorts of scum here.}
{102}{}{我们这里不需要什么人渣。}
#{110}{}{Oh, look. The stranger from the wastes has decided how our community should be run. You know what I think?}
{110}{}{哦，看。来自荒野的陌生人决定了我们的社区应该如何管理。你知道我怎么想吗？}
#{111}{}{I couldn't care less what- }
{111}{}{我不在乎什么-}
#{112}{}{What do you- }
{112}{}{你觉得呢-}
#{113}{}{[He ignores you] That my old man's right! The only thing we ought to give you newcomers is two loads of buckshot! You think I don't have the guts to do that? Try me. TRY ME!}
{113}{}{[他不理你]我老爸是对的！我们唯一应该给你们的新来者就是两车子弹！你认为我没有勇气这么做？试试我。试试我！}
#{114}{}{With what, dumbass, your invisible shotgun?}
{114}{}{用什么，笨蛋，你的隐形猎枪？}
#{115}{}{Why do you want to shoot us? No one did anything wrong.}
{115}{}{你为什么要开枪打我们？没人做错什么。}
#{116}{}{Oh yeah? Well, uh... Fuck! [he angrily kicks the fence hard enough to rattle the beams] I'm warning you. Don't fuck with us! [he turns around and storms off, mumbling something under his breath]}
{116}{}{哦，是吗？嗯，呃...性交！我警告你。别耍我们！[他转过身，气喘吁吁地走了]}
#{117}{}{Us? Who's us?..}
{117}{}{我们？我们是谁？。。}
#{118}{}{[He ignores you] That my old man's right! The only thing we ought to give newcomers is two loads of buckshot! And I can tell you think the same thing. }
{118}{}{[他不理你]我老爸是对的！我们唯一应该给新来的人的就是两车子弹！我可以告诉你你也这么想。}
#{119}{}{But don't think that makes us friends. Watch yourself, and don't piss us off. [he turns around and walks away]}
{119}{}{但别以为我们是朋友。小心点，别惹我们生气。[他转身走开]}
#{120}{}{Yeah, what?}
{120}{}{是啊，什么？}
#{121}{}{Nothing.}
{121}{}{没有什么。}
#{122}{}{I want to talk about your raider gang.}
{122}{}{我想谈谈你的突击队。}
#{123}{}{[He laughs] Oh, my raider gang? When did I get that?}
{123}{}{[他笑]哦，我的突击队？我什么时候收到的？}
#{124}{}{Stop lying. I know you killed Milo, so you'd better start talking.}
{124}{}{别撒谎了。我知道你杀了米洛，所以你最好开始说话。}
#{125}{}{You know I'm telling the truth, even if no one else does. It's only a matter of time until I get the evidence to prove it. I'll be back when I do.}
{125}{}{你知道我说的是实话，即使没人说。我迟早会有证据证明的。我会回来的。}
#{126}{}{Who, me? [he looks around with an unconvincing expression of utter dismay] And why should I believe that?}
{126}{}{谁，我？（他环顾四周，一副毫无说服力的沮丧表情）我为什么要相信呢？}
#{127}{}{Gravedigger Bob is wearing Milo's boots. He told me everything.}
{127}{}{掘墓人鲍勃穿着米洛的靴子。他把一切都告诉了我。}
#{128}{}{I have evidence from Gerlach. You were seen talking to Milo there, for example. Give me the truth and I won't have to go to William or your father.}
{128}{}{我有杰拉克的证据。例如，有人看到你在那里和米洛说话。告诉我真相，我就不用去找威廉或你父亲了。}
#{129}{}{Bob told you? [he looks around anxiously before he leans in] Fine, newcomer, you got me. What now?}
{129}{}{鲍勃告诉你了？[他焦急地环顾四周，然后才探身进去]好吧，新来的，你抓住我了。现在怎么办？}
#{130}{}{[He looks around anxiously before he leans in] Fine, newcomer, you got me. What now?}
{130}{}{[他焦急地环顾四周，然后才探身进去]好吧，新来的，你抓住我了。现在怎么办？}
#{131}{}{I want details. Tell me exactly what happened to Milo.}
{131}{}{我想要细节。告诉我米洛到底怎么了。}
#{132}{}{That's it? You'll leave me alone after this?}
{132}{}{就这样？你会让我一个人呆着吗？}
#{133}{}{Why Milo?}
{133}{}{为什么是米洛？}
#{134}{}{How did you know about the delivery?}
{134}{}{你是怎么知道送货的？}
#{135}{}{What did you do with the package?}
{135}{}{你对包裹做了什么？}
#{136}{}{Tell me about your gang.}
{136}{}{告诉我你的帮派。}
#{137}{}{Didn't you think you'd be caught eventually?}
{137}{}{你不觉得你最终会被抓住吗？}
#{138}{}{Let??s talk about your punishment.}
{138}{}{让我们谈谈你的惩罚。}
#{139}{}{Milo had an agreement with the gang back when we were big. He'd give us information, and we'd keep him from being attacked. That's how he managed to make all his deliveries. For a while, we controlled the whole valley.}
{139}{}{米洛在我们大的时候和那帮人有协议。他会给我们信息，我们会阻止他受到攻击。他就是这样把所有的东西都送出去的。有一段时间，我们控制了整个山谷。}
#{140}{}{William wanted gecko skins from Gerlach to set up some crazy caravan deal. My father said he'd ruin everything. I went to Milo, told him to lose the skins, but he told me to fuck off. That's when the gang decided to get rid of him. I didn't want this to happen, I swear! But I couldn't stop them.}
{140}{}{威廉想从杰拉克那里得到壁虎皮来做些疯狂的商队交易。我父亲说他会毁了一切。我去了米洛，叫他脱皮，但他叫我滚开。就在那时，那帮人决定除掉他。我不想发生这种事，我发誓！但我阻止不了他们。}
#{141}{}{I didn't take any of it, but the rest of the gang took the skins. What they did with them, I don't know.}
{141}{}{我一点也没拿，但其他人都拿了皮。我不知道他们对他们做了什么。}
#{142}{}{We're the Molerats! You've never heard of us? Most of us came from Reno, with a few from Salt Lake City. Thieves, killers, pimps - we were everything a gang could be, back when we were big. Hey, don't look at me like that! We were all just trying to survive.}
{142}{}{我们是鼹鼠！你从没听说过我们？我们大多数人来自雷诺，少数人来自盐湖城。小偷，杀手，皮条客-我们是一个帮派可能的一切，回到我们大的时候。嘿，别那样看着我！我们都只是为了生存。}
#{143}{}{Ohh, scary. Do you have any idea what you're talking about? We're a GANG! We've killed more people than you've ever met! And you won't be a problem either, got it?}
{143}{}{哦，吓人。你知道你在说什么吗？我们是帮派！我们杀的人比你见过的还多！你也不会成为问题，明白吗？}
#{144}{}{You think I'm scared of you? The Molerats aren't what we used to be, but we're still a hell of a lot tougher than you.}
{144}{}{你以为我怕你？鼹鼠已经不是我们以前的样子了，但我们还是比你坚强得多。}
#{145}{}{Maybe, but right now, you'd better answer my questions.}
{145}{}{也许吧，但是现在，你最好回答我的问题。}
#{146}{}{Think what you want, but I'll find a way to bring justice to you. Now get the fuck out of here.}
{146}{}{想什么就想什么，但我会想办法为你伸张正义的。现在他妈的滚出去。}
#{147}{}{Maybe, maybe not. See you around, Eugene.}
{147}{}{也许，也许不是。再见，尤金。}
#{148}{}{How has the gang lasted this long?}
{148}{}{这个帮派怎么会持续这么久？}
#{149}{}{Huh? Why?}
{149}{}{呵呵？为什么？}
#{150}{}{Because I can help you guys. Seriously.}
{150}{}{因为我可以帮你们。说真的。}
#{151}{}{Because you need to leave the gang behind and go straight.}
{151}{}{因为你得离开那帮人，直走。}
#{152}{}{Because it will be the last day of your life.}
{152}{}{因为这将是你生命的最后一天。}
#{153}{}{Think what you want. I have more questions.}
{153}{}{想什么就想什么。我还有更多的问题。}
#{154}{}{You? You think you're Molerat material? This isn't some fucking boy scout troop. How many people have you killed, huh?}
{154}{}{你呢？你以为你是分子材料？这不是什么他妈的童子军。你杀了多少人？}
#{155}{}{You're talking to the vilest raider on this side of the continent. Pay some fucking respect.}
{155}{}{你在和大陆这边最卑鄙的袭击者说话。他妈的尊重我。}
#{156}{}{More than everyone in this anthill of a village.}
{156}{}{比这个蚁丘上的每个人都要多。}
#{157}{}{"Cursed" is written on my face. And it??s like this everywhere I go.}
{157}{}{“被诅咒”写在我的脸上。我所到之处都是这样。}
#{158}{}{I kill anyone and everyone, children included. You think your gang are hard shit? If you've never heard the death rattle of a disemboweled toddler, you don't deserve to even talk to me.}
{158}{}{我杀了所有人，包括孩子。你觉得你的帮派很难对付？如果你从来没有听到过一个断肠的蹒跚学步的孩子发出的死亡的嘎嘎声，你就不配跟我说话。}
#{159}{}{Forget it, let's talk about something else.}
{159}{}{算了吧，我们谈点别的吧。}
#{160}{}{[He pauses for a moment] You know, I think you just might be the real deal. Maybe there's something you can do for us, after all.}
{160}{}{[他停顿了一下]你知道，我想你可能是真正的交易。也许你能为我们做点什么。}
#{161}{}{Great. Let's hear it.}
{161}{}{伟大的。让我们听听。}
#{162}{}{Yeah, I've heard that before. From Milo, for example. Now look at him.}
{162}{}{是的，我以前听过。例如，从米洛。现在看看他。}
#{163}{}{Not very convincing, huh? Okay, let's talk about it...}
{163}{}{不是很有说服力吧？好吧，我们来谈谈...}
#{164}{}{Fuck, you're right. After what happened to Milo... Shit, I don't know what to do. Maybe I should walk away. The gang's on the ropes, anyway... }
{164}{}{妈的，你说得对。在米洛出事后...妈的，我不知道该怎么办。也许我该走了。不管怎么说，这帮人已经岌岌可危了...}
#{165}{}{Tell me what they're planning. I'll take care of everything.}
{165}{}{告诉我他们在计划什么。我会处理好一切的。}
#{166}{}{You'll have to hurry. They're going to ambush the caravan when it gets close to the mountains. They'll kill everyone and take everything - it'll be like the whole caravan just disappeared. Here, take this radio and these frequencies. It's the only way you'll be able to find them.}
{166}{}{你得快点。他们要在大篷车接近山区时伏击它。他们会杀了所有人，拿走所有的东西，就像整个商队都消失了一样。拿着这个收音机和这些频率。只有这样你才能找到他们。}
#{167}{}{I'll keep this in mind.}
{167}{}{我会记住的。}
#{168}{}{What, you can't wait to stick your nose into the gang?}
{168}{}{什么，你迫不及待地想把鼻子伸进帮派？}
#{169}{}{I heard what happened. Well... No going back now.}
{169}{}{我听说发生了什么事。好...现在不能回去了。}
#{170}{}{Well well.}
{170}{}{好吧，好吧。}
#{1110}{}{Oh, look. The stranger from the wastes has decided how our community should be run. You know what I think?}
{1110}{}{哦，看。来自荒野的陌生人决定了我们的社区应该如何管理。你知道我怎么想吗？}
#{1129}{}{Bob told you? [he looks around anxiously before he leans in] Fine, newcomer, you got me. What now?}
{1129}{}{鲍勃告诉你了？[他焦急地环顾四周，然后才探身进去]好吧，新来的，你抓住我了。现在怎么办？}
#{1130}{}{[He looks around anxiously before he leans in] Fine, newcomer, you got me. What now?}
{1130}{}{[他焦急地环顾四周，然后才探身进去]好吧，新来的，你抓住我了。现在怎么办？}
#{1154}{}{You? You think you're Molerat material? These aren't the fucking girl guides. How many people have you killed, huh?}
{1154}{}{你呢？你以为你是分子材料？这些不是该死的女导游。你杀了多少人？}
