### {1}{}{You see a skinny, wiry man.}
{1}{}{你看到一个瘦骨嶙峋的男人。}
### {2}{}{He patronizingly gazes at everyone around him, as if knowing something they don't.}
{2}{}{他屈尊俯就地凝视着周围的每一个人，好像知道一些他们不知道的事情。}

# ????? ??????????
### {3}{}{You see Dan.}
{3}{}{你看到丹了。}

#????? ?????????? ??????

### {14}{}{[He is clearly not young, but grey eyes on his shallow, cunning face are still burning with a thirst for action.] A new face around here? What brings you to me, boy? Do you think that old buddy Dan would help you become the recruit of "Steel law"? [he smiles, but his eyes stay serious]}
{14}{}{[他显然已经不年轻了，但他那张浅而狡猾的脸上的灰色眼睛仍然渴望行动。]这里有新面孔吗？什么风把你吹到我这里来，孩子？你认为老朋友丹会帮助你成为“钢铁法律”的新兵吗？[他微笑着，但眼神严肃]}
### {10}{011}{I am }
{10}{011}{我是}
### {11}{011}{. What "Steel law" are you talking about?}
{11}{011}{.你在说什么“钢铁法”？}
### {12}{999}{Hello, Dan. My name is }
{12}{999}{你好，丹。我的名字是}
### {13}{999}{. I'm just looking around for now. Well, I won't be bothering you. Bye.}
{13}{999}{。我现在只是四处看看。好吧，我不会打扰你的。再见}


### {1001}{}{[Seeing you, he slightly nods, not changing his posture] What brings you to me, outsider? I hope your brains have not yet been brainwashed by Mark and his company. You know, about the "Steel law" being the biggest threat to NWO.}
{1001}{}{【看到你，他微微点了点头，没有改变姿势】什么把你带到我这里来，局外人？我希望你的大脑还没有被马克和他的公司洗脑。你知道，关于“钢铁法”是NWO面临的最大威胁。}
### {101}{011}{Yes, I wanted to ask - what is this "Steel law"?}
{101}{011}{是的，我想问――这是什么“钢铁定律”？}
### {102}{015}{I've recently learned something interesting about you and Lucy... I mean, Daniel's name is a huge spoiler by itself.}
{102}{015}{我最近了解了一些关于你和露西的有趣的事情。。。我的意思是，丹尼尔的名字本身就是一个巨大的搅局者。}
### {103}{999}{I was just walking by. Talk later, Dan.}
{103}{999}{我只是路过。稍后再谈，丹。}
### {1002}{}{[He puts his palm to the chest and respectfully nods to you, hiding his eyes] Greetings and respect to the worthy successor of our old man Mark! I hope now the way things are done around here will change. [he smiles a little]}
{1002}{}{[他把手掌放在胸前，毕恭毕敬地向你点头，隐藏着眼睛]向我们的老先生马克的值得继承的人致以问候和敬意！我希望现在这里的做法会有所改变。[他微微一笑]}
### {104}{016}{I see you have some ideas about that. Tell me.}
{104}{016}{我看你对此有一些想法。告诉我。}
### {105}{999}{That's for me to decide, Dan. Your duty is to follow orders. Remember that. I'll see you around.}
{105}{999}{这由我来决定，丹。你的职责是服从命令。记住这一点。我回头见。}
### {106}{017}{Sure! Enough of tolerating the expansion of Jackals and Rainbow! It's time to impose in the Radius our law... Steel law!}
{106}{017}{当然受够了《豺狼与彩虹》的膨胀！是时候把我们的法律强加于Radius了。。。钢铁定律！}
### {1003}{}{[He swiftly throws beads into his left hand and squeezes your palm in a firm handshake] Glad to see you, kid! I'll admit, I had some doubts about you in the beginning. But now, when Daniel is behind the wheel, and not without your help... What I want to say is - you are always welcomed in my home.}
{1003}{}{[他迅速把珠子扔到左手里，紧紧地握着你的手掌]很高兴见到你，孩子！我承认，一开始我对你有些怀疑。但现在，当丹尼尔开车时，并非没有你的帮助。。。我想说的是，你在我家总是受到欢迎的。}
### {107}{018}{So, changes for the better?}
{107}{018}{那么，变好了吗？}
### {108}{999}{I did what I thought was right... Was nice seeing you, Dan, but I have to go.}
{108}{999}{我做了我认为正确的事。。。很高兴见到你，丹，但我得走了。}
### {1004}{}{[He wraps his beads around the fist, forming a knuckle, and hisses] I didn't like you from the start... If I only knew you would wreck everything I worked on. The deadman in charge! Do you realize what it will lead to? It's okay, my time would come eventually... And you - get lost. I have no intentions to keep our conversation going.}
{1004}{}{[他把珠子包在拳头上，形成一个指节，发出嘶嘶声]我从一开始就不喜欢你。。。要是我知道你会毁了我做的所有事情就好了。那个负责人！你知道它会导致什么吗？没关系，我的时代终将到来。。。而你――迷路了。我无意继续我们的谈话。}
### {109}{999}{You mad? Just try to do something about it, and I'll bury you. Peace out, petty revolutionary.}
{109}{999}{你疯了？试着做点什么，我就把你埋了。和平吧，小革命家。}
### {1010}{999}{I hope one day you will understand that this was the best option. Bye, Dan.}
{1010}{999}{我希望有一天你会明白这是最好的选择。再见，丹。}
### {1005}{}{[Dan adjusts the armband on his sleeve and salutes you] Reporting - the agitation process among the local population is proceeding quite well. My Arsene is very persuasive... As for me, I'm busy with making the list of those who would better be off somewhere else. Ghouls, for example... And the main thing is that we keep hoarding weapons. We are trying to do it as quietly as we can. We don't need unnecessary attention.}
{1005}{}{[丹调整袖子上的臂章，向你致敬]报道-当地民众的骚动过程进行得很顺利。我的阿森很有说服力。。。至于我，我正忙于列出那些最好去其他地方的人的名单。例如食尸鬼。。。最重要的是，我们一直在囤积武器。我们正在尽可能安静地做这件事。我们不需要不必要的关注。}
### {1011}{999}{That's the spirit! Everything should be ready when I'll give the order to move out. Okay, talk later.}
{1011}{999}{这就是精神！当我下令搬出去的时候，一切都应该准备好了。好的，稍后再谈。}


### {110}{}{[Dan becomes more lively, his eyes assessing you] What, no one nagged to you about it? Hm... Okay, why not help a good man, enlightening him on what's what. Here's the thing, now NWO is lead by a bunch of idealists, naively trying to make peace with other settlements of the Radius through negotiations and establishing trading relations. How stupid is that? Fortunately, there are some people who understand that you can accomplish something in this cursed world only by the power of a weapon. They call themselves "Steel law". With good old expansionism, we could capture enough prisoners to significantly increase our production and military capacities! So it goes. And yeah, for some reason people always take me for a leader of this covert organization... We get these dirty looks all the time, me and my son. Have you met Arsene, by the way? Good kid, except a little hot-headed... }
{110}{}{[丹变得更活泼了，他的眼睛在打量你]什么，没人跟你唠叨？嗯…好吧，为什么不帮助一个好人，启发他什么是什么。事情是这样的，现在NWO由一群理想主义者领导，天真地试图通过谈判和建立贸易关系与Radius的其他定居点和平相处。这有多愚蠢？幸运的是，有些人明白，在这个被诅咒的世界里，你只能靠武器的力量才能有所作为。他们自称“钢铁定律”。有了良好的旧扩张主义，我们可以俘虏足够多的囚犯，以显著提高我们的生产和军事能力！就这样。是的，出于某种原因，人们总是认为我是这个秘密组织的领导人。。。我和我的儿子，我们总是被这些肮脏的眼神所吸引。顺便问一下，你见过阿森吗？好孩子，除了有点头脑发热。。。}
### {111}{012}{What's wrong with peaceful ways of dealing with problems? I'm not much into violence, you know...}
{111}{012}{以和平的方式处理问题有什么错？我不太喜欢暴力，你知道。。。}
### {112}{013}{And you are, of course, unrelated to this "Steel law", aren't you? If I'd like to help - who should I talk to?}
{112}{013}{当然，你与这个“钢铁定律”毫无关联，不是吗？如果我想帮忙，我应该和谁谈谈？}
### {113}{014}{Hm... And why do you... I mean, they even hope for achieving success? Other factions of the Radius have some serious power and men.}
{113}{014}{嗯…你为什么。。。我的意思是，他们甚至希望取得成功？Radius的其他派系拥有一些强大的力量和人员。}
### {114}{999}{I see. Well, I'm not very interested in local politics. See you!}
{114}{999}{我明白了。嗯，我对地方政治不太感兴趣。再见}


### {120}{}{[He leniently chuckles] With whom? With Jackals? Or with crazy junkies from Rainbow? Or with greedy snobs from Olympus? We were attacked before, you know. It was a miracle we fought off. Want to know why? Because there were some guys, who traded their batteries for good guns, instead of some peaceful crap. You can do more with a good gun than with a good word. That's the way it has always been. That's the message "Steel law" is trying to get to everyone.}
{120}{}{[他宽容地笑了笑]和谁在一起？和豺狼在一起？还是和彩虹的疯狂瘾君子？还是和奥林匹斯的贪婪势利小人在一起？你知道，我们以前被袭击过。这是一个奇迹，我们击退了。想知道为什么吗？因为有些人用他们的电池换了好枪，而不是一些和平的垃圾。你可以用一把好枪做得比用一句好话做得更多。一直都是这样。这就是“钢铁法律”试图传达给每个人的信息。}
### {121}{013}{But you are, of course, unrelated to this "Steel law", aren't you? If I'd like to help - who should I talk to?}
{121}{013}{但你当然与这个“钢铁定律”无关，不是吗？如果我想帮忙，我应该和谁谈谈？}
### {122}{014}{Hm... And why do you... I mean, they even hope for achieving success? Other factions of the Radius have some serious power and men.}
{122}{014}{嗯…你为什么。。。我的意思是，他们甚至希望取得成功？Radius的其他派系拥有一些强大的力量和人员。}
### {123}{999}{I need to think about it. See you around, Dan.}
{123}{999}{我需要考虑一下。再见，丹。}


### {130}{}{[He shrugs with seeming indifference] How do I know? I'm very loyal to the current management. I would be only glad if Daniel succeeded Mark as mayor.... [Dan smiles, gazing above your head] He is worthy of his father, you know. And he has a good opinion about the "Steel law".}
{130}{}{[他似乎漠不关心地耸耸肩]我怎么知道？我对现任管理层非常忠诚。如果丹尼尔接替马克担任市长，我会很高兴。。。。[丹微笑着，凝视着你的头顶]你知道，他配得上他的父亲。他对《钢铁法》有很好的评价。}
### {131}{015}{I bet you would. Your blood is your blood, right? You and Lucy put a lot of effort into it...}
{131}{015}{我打赌你会的。你的血就是你的血，对吧？你和露西为此付出了很多努力。。。}
### {132}{012}{I still don't get it. What's wrong with peaceful ways of dealing with problems? I'm not much into violence, you know...}
{132}{012}{我仍然不明白。用和平的方式处理问题有什么错？我不太喜欢暴力，你知道。。。}
### {133}{014}{Why does "Steel law" even hopes for achieving success? Other factions of Radius have some serious power and men.}
{133}{014}{为什么《钢铁法》甚至希望获得成功？Radius的其他派系拥有一些强大的力量和人员。}
### {134}{999}{Okay, I'll go talk to him. Thanks for the information, Dan.}
{134}{999}{好的，我去和他谈谈。丹，谢谢你的消息。}


### {140}{}{[He moves his shoulders as if warming up before the fight] No one said that this would be easy. But it's going to be worth it. Besides, our advantage is that no one waits for us to do something like this. }
{140}{}{[他移动肩膀，好像在赛前热身]没有人说这会很容易。但这是值得的。此外，我们的优势是没有人等着我们做这样的事情。}
### {141}{012}{I still don't get it. What's wrong with peaceful ways of dealing with problems? I'm not much into violence, you know...}
{141}{012}{我仍然不明白。用和平的方式处理问题有什么错？我不太喜欢暴力，你知道。。。}
### {142}{013}{And you are, of course, unrelated to this "Steel law", aren't you? If I'd like to help - who should I talk to?}
{142}{013}{当然，你与这个“钢铁定律”毫无关联，不是吗？如果我想帮忙，我应该和谁谈谈？}
### {143}{999}{Maybe there is something about it... I need to think it over. I need to go, thanks for the info.}
{143}{999}{也许有什么…我需要好好想想。我得走了，谢谢你的消息。}


### {150}{}{[Contrary to your expectations, Dan only lazily sits by the wall and continues to cycle through his beads] Did Sam tell you this? This ghoul is completely lost his mind from radiation. If my son and Daniel are friends - that means I banged Lucy? So logical! Go do your business, and next time think before trying to surprise me. You looked pretty stupid, pal.}
{150}{}{[与你的预期相反，丹只是懒洋洋地坐在墙上，继续在他的珠子里打转]山姆告诉你了吗？这个食尸鬼完全被辐射弄糊涂了。如果我儿子和丹尼尔是朋友，那就意味着我撞了露西？太合乎逻辑了！去做你的事吧，下次想一想再给我一个惊喜。你看起来很愚蠢，伙计。}
### {151}{999}{Okay, I'll go. It doesn't matter much anyway. Stay on your toes, Dan. See you around.}
{151}{999}{好的，我走。不管怎样，这并不重要。保持警觉，丹。回头见。}


### {160}{}{[He clears his throat and starts to eloquently speak] In my humble opinion, now is the best moment to organize a massive attack on all fronts. People are ready for changes and full of enthusiasm. I could develop a project plan concerning the occupation of nearby territories. I already have some ideas...}
{160}{}{[他清了清嗓子，开始雄辩地讲话]在我看来，现在是组织全面进攻的最佳时机。人们随时准备改变，充满热情。我可以制定一个关于占领附近领土的项目计划。我已经有了一些想法。。。}
### {161}{017}{Sure! Enough of tolerating the expansion of Jackals and Rainbow! It's time to impose in the Radius our law... Steel law!}
{161}{017}{当然受够了《豺狼与彩虹》的膨胀！是时候把我们的法律强加于Radius了。。。钢铁定律！}
### {162}{999}{That's for me to decide, which way to go. Your duty is to follow orders. Remember that and don't take too much upon yourself. Take care, Dan.}
{162}{999}{走哪条路由我来决定。你的职责是服从命令。记住这一点，不要过于自负。小心，丹。}


### {170}{}{[Dan pulls out an armband from his pocket, which depicts a mechanical hand, holding the skull in a tight grip. He puts it on your shoulder] I knew this day would come. Me and my son will immediately take action in the name of "Steel law". I will persuade those who have doubts and punish all renegades... You'll see, soon everyone around here will join us in our crusade to Rainbow and Olympus! }
{170}{}{[丹从口袋里掏出一个臂章，上面画的是一只机械手，紧紧抓住头骨。他把它放在你的肩膀上]我就知道这一天会到来。我和我的儿子将立即以“钢铁法律”的名义采取行动。我会说服那些心存疑虑的人，惩罚所有叛徒。。。你会看到的，很快这里的每个人都会加入我们的十字军东征彩虹和奥林巴斯！}
### {171}{999}{Be careful. You can't rush this, we must succeed for sure. Report to me personally. I need to go now. Good luck!}
{171}{999}{小心。你不能操之过急，我们一定要成功。亲自向我报告。我现在得走了。祝你好运}


### {180}{}{True. Daniel is much more forward-looking in the matter of picking allies than his fath- Uh, Mark. He takes "Steel law" much closer to the heart, and listens to the opinion of experienced people, who put their soul into the prosperity of NWO. }
{180}{}{没错。在挑选盟友的问题上，丹尼尔比他的胖子马克更具前瞻性。他将“钢铁定律”更贴近内心，倾听经验丰富的人的意见，他们将自己的灵魂投入到NWO的繁荣中。}
### {181}{999}{Time will tell if you're right. Good luck.}
{181}{999}{时间会证明你是否正确。祝你好运}
