{100}{}{You see: Quincy, the shop owner.}
#
{101}{}{Hello there, wanna take a look at my wares?}
#
{102}{}{Sure thing.}
{103}{}{Not right now.}
#
{104}{}{Thank you sir, come again anytime.}
{105}{}{Bye.}
#
{106}{}{Sorry, we're not working at this time.}
{107}{}{Come back in the morning.}
{108}{}{I open at 8 A.M.}
{109}{}{Sorry we're closed.}
#
{110}{}{Derek told me you might have some hunting rifles in your stock. I need ten to be precise.}
#
{111}{}{I'm sorry but I sold the last one a few days ago. You know, demand for rifles has increased since...
 [Scratching his head.] Well, since I started selling them, really. It could take me a while to get you the amount
 you're looking for, maybe a month or so...}
#
{112}{}{I can't wait that long. Is there some other place in town where I could find some hardware?}
{113}{}{You bet, I'm out of here.}
#
{114}{}{Since Derek hired you I suppose he hasn't told you anything about their competition; "The Bulls". They, too,
 represent the people and protect - guess who - the people. These two rival groups always had something against each
 other and are always trying to prove they know what is in our best interest. Whew... I'm way off topic. Weapons,
 eh...?}
#
{115}{}{Yes...}
#
{116}{}{I got something that has to be repaired, can you take a look at it?}
#
{117}{}{OK, give it to me. [You hand him the part.] This looks very bad. Hmm... nope... Well. You might get lucky
 this time. I haven't seen any of these old air purifiers for many years, but I might be able to do something about it...}
{118}{}{So, it can be repaired?}
#
{119}{}{Yes but... it'll cost you, about $1000.}
{120}{}{No way, I don't wanna pay so much for that crap.}
{121}{}{Actually, Clark sent me and told me that you might be able to fix it.}
{122}{}{I'm out of here.}
#no way...
{123}{}{It's your part, do whatever you want with it. As far as I can tell it *is* broken and it's not gonna work in
 that state. Have a nice day!}
{124}{}{[Leave.]}
#actually...
{125}{}{Heh... Why didn't you say so! His old man was a friend of mine... So how is the boy doing? Still chasing
 girls? Hehe.}
{126}{}{Yeah, I'm sure he's doing "something"... um... fine...}
#
{127}{}{Hehe... Yep, just like his old man. OK, let's take a look at this thing. Oh... This is bad... [He takes his
 pliers and starts twisting wires.] This can also be fixed. [Tears out something and throws it behind him.] This doesn't
 look bad, ah... What the hell. [He starts "digging" a hole into the part.]}
{128}{}{Whoa... You sure you know what you are doing...?}
#
{129}{}{Keep it quiet there, kid... I'm working here... Hmmm... Well it's done. How does it look? [He made a hollow
 can from the barely functional part]...}
{130}{}{It looks, uh... empty?}
#
{131}{}{How comes...? Shit, forgot my eyeglasses. [He puts his glasses on.] Oh dear, I fucked it good! Ah, to hell
 with the damn thing! [Throws it away.] I'm just gonna do this... [Takes a brand new part from the shelf.] There you
 go... I don't know why I am even trying to fix this crap... Those old days, eh... Hehe. OK, kid, you have your part.
 Enjoy it!}
{132}{}{Thanks, bye.}
#
{133}{}{I don't deal with criminals.}
{134}{}{You better get out!}
{135}{}{You don't wanna piss me off!}
{136}{}{Get the fuck out of my store!}
{137}{}{You fucking murderer!}
# after 115...
{138}{}{Since Derek needs them... You might be able to find some weaponry in the Bulls' "stash". Every once in a
 while they buy stuff from me so I figure they have to store that somewhere, right? Anyway, you didn't hear this from
 me!}
{139}{}{Sure thing. [Leave.]}
#no doors?
{140}{}{I see you got this place secured like a bunker, how do you get out?}
{141}{}{Now that's a good question. Do I actually need to get out? But let me tell you, before you really get out of
 somewhere, first you must dig deep and then you'll find your answer. A good mystery begs to be solved, indeed.}
{142}{}{Alright, you almost got me there Sherlock.}
#
{143}{}{Who are you?}
#
{144}{}{I'm Quincy, the local supplier of everything-you-need and you happen to be in my store-house, whatever you
 want to call it. Coincidence, I think not, lets get busy shall we?}
